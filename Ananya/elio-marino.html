        +18 MATURE CONTENT &quot;Even The Wicked Needs Love.&quot; ELIO MARINO,
        also known as IL MALVAGIO 'The Wicked' is a man whose presence alone is
        enough to evoke a silence more sinister than the one from a graveyard.
        Nothing could shake him, or so he believed. ZAHRA FAIZAN was trouble.
        Growing up with men who treated bullets like sugar cubes, she has risen
        from the streets and created the most notorious gang of thieves in the
        whole of Italy, but after a job gone wrong, she finds herself and her
        crew held captive by The Wicked, and she would do just about anything to
        take advantage of it. Even if it was as foolish as performing the
        biggest heist her gang has ever gotten to dream of. Little did she know
        she was about to be thrust right into a wicked world, wicked than the
        one she had once known. Could she tame the wicked and bring him to his
        ruin? Or tame him and keep him to herself? After all, even the wicked
        needs love.

            in movies...In real life, they are not who you'd wish to get
            kidnapped by. They are way more ruthless, violent and deceptive. The
            entertainment industry gives you a reason to be sympathetic with
            them, maybe it's a sad backstory that might involve them being
            forced into it, or some story that is meant for you to glorify
            them... Perhaps, some of these people were forced, but I'll have you
            know that majority were drawn to it due to the lust for money and
            most of all, power.

      <div>
        <p>
          <b>A/N: </b>Hello, tell me where you are and what you were doing
          before you saw this update. (I promise I'm not a creep even though
          this is what a creep would say. Shite!)<br />
        </p>
        <p><b>Elio Marino </b></p>
        <p>
          <b>LOYALTY WAS</b> one word you would never find in his dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honor changed routes the moment he tasted power, the moment he felt
          the thrill course through his veins. It was blissful; being on top of
          the world, touching the skies, making the rules, and bending them.
        </p>
        <p>
          His whole being hungered for respect, praise, power, and status. This
          was the kind of world he grew up in. A kind of world where you could
          only sleep with one eye closed, a kind of world that reeked of blood,
          gunpowder, drugs, and sex, a kind of world that could be considered
          hell; only him, having to get a spot at one of the high tables where
          he could watch the happenings from above.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was used to it; it was a part of him. It blended well with his
          personality, and he never intended to change it; neither was he
          planning to give up the power he had acquired.
        </p>
        <p>
          He loved it when people called him<b> I</b><b>L </b><b>MALVAGI</b
          ><b>O </b>which meant: <i>The Wicked</i>; It pleased him to be the man
          who created the eeriest silence, the man whose voice was a supplement
          to the word command.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't want it to end. At least, not until he was certain it was
          time for it to end. That was one of the reasons why he never denied it
          whenever the wind whispered the rumors of him killing his Father,
          Ricardo Marino, former Boss of the Marino Empire; that was why he
          smiled whenever the little birds chirped secrets of him stabbing his
          mother to death; that was why he never denied it when the ones who
          didn't know him, spoke of his clever work in setting his siblings on
          fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these reasons, they feared him. For these reasons, no one dared to
          look him in the eye when they talked.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one except his underboss, Casmiro Valerio could look him in the
          eye—could withstand him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He seldom suspected the man had ill intentions and never trusted him,
          even if he had known him since they were both six.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's father worked for his father, and now Casmiro worked for
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe there had been a time when he could have trusted Casmiro with
          his life, but he knew how fickle trust was, Elio didn't trust himself
          enough to even let Casmiro trust him, but then again, that was what he
          thought of every man under him. His consigliere, Angelo; his Capos,
          Soldiers, and even his Associates. He trusted no one, and no one
          trusted him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better that way. Keeping people on their toes was what he liked
          doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro had tried multiple times to gain his trust again, become his
          brother, and be fully part of a family where one slip-up led to a
          bullet through your skull. But Elio wasn't having it. He always stuck
          to the fact that they never used to play together when they were
          children, no matter how much Casmiro liked to think they did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio believed it was expected, and yes, they might have shared a few
          stupid toys, but that didn't make them friends or brothers, and he
          didn't care about Casmiro. He would put a bullet through Casmiro's
          head if he ever sensed a real threat to his goals, and that was that
          to it.
        </p>
        <p>Everyone's fear was him, and everyone's worst nightmare was him.</p>
        <p>
          A shiver was meant to run through anyone's spine just by sighting him.
          His infamous fitted black suit with a black button-up shirt
          underneath, coupled with a well-knotted tie to add to his dark aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was like a uniform, his unique uniform, and he didn't like it any
          other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "White doesn't suit you, <b><i>Figlio</i></b
          >...why do you think I never wear anything with bright colors, hm? You
          don't want to get stained with the sinners' blood and let it show, do
          you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          With his good looks, he could have any woman beneath him. His deep
          dark grey eyes were enough to leave women lusting after him. Tattoos
          snaking around his left hand to the tip of his left ear, stringing
          along to the back of his neck; he screamed dominance... when he moved,
          he moved graciously, as if time was on his side... one foot after the
          other, a seductive sound to the ears of those unlucky enough to hear
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          His deep, accented voice blessed the ears of everyone around him when
          he was in a good mood to talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          He never smiled. He saw no use for it. There was nothing to smile at.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could still remember it as clear as day, dragged to one of his
          father's many business meetings. He dared to laugh when one of their
          Capos made a funny joke. 9-year-old Elio received the beating of his
          life when they returned to the Marino empire's safety. He still had
          the scars to show for it. They stung mentally each time he saw
          something potentially funny to smile or laugh at.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why won't you learn, <b><i>Figlio</i></b
          ><b>?</b> You smile, you lose your respect... never fucking smile.
          Always remember, <b><i>Figlio</i></b
          >, there is nothing to smile at."
        </p>
        <p>
          For a man who thrived from power and respect, the words of his old man
          were synonymous with gold atop his palm; he never forgot a single
          sentence, even when, at that time, the man would make life miserable
          for him, he loved and respected him nonetheless, all he did, all the
          power he had acquired, he acquired them all for his father, and he was
          glad he did, seeing as he loved the fact that no one could read him or
          his next move; He would have included emotions amongst the things
          people couldn't read, but he didn't think he had any left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear, anger, sadness, happiness, remorse, regret, frustration, care,
          jealousy, envy. They were all gone. He couldn't even remember what it
          felt like to just—<i>feel</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lost all sense of humanity a long time ago and developed a
          nickname—a nickname bound to send a man to his early grave just by the
          mere mention of it.
        </p>
        <p>He was <i>The Wicked</i>. And he loved it—more than anything.</p>
        <p>
          The air was still, the smell of Cuban Cigars slightly fogging the
          large office. Courtesy of Elio, who sat at the visitor's seat, the
          cigar pressed between his lips, as he relaxed on the chair, his suit
          long discarded, leaving him with his black button-up and navy green
          tie. His eyes, half open, gave his thick long lashes a chance to
          shadow beneath his eyes, as he stared at the man sitting on the
          throne-like chair, his eyes not moving an inch since both he and
          Casmiro stepped into Basilio's home—one of his Capos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basilio, the bald man, kept glancing in Elio's direction, fear in his
          dark eyes. His heart was racing, seeing as Elio hadn't said a word
          since they entered the office; <i>The wicked</i> just gave him '<i
            >the look,'</i
          >
          the look Basilio had seen him give to people who were now six feet
          under.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We didn't see them." Basilio voiced out, trying to keep his voice
          stern. "They were like shadows. No footsteps were heard, but our
          soldiers fell noiselessly one by one."
        </p>
        <p>"Security cameras?" Casmiro asked, his face rigid with annoyance.</p>
        <p>
          "Tampered with. We don't know how. My guys are working on getting back
          control."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're still locked out?" The disbelief was evident in Casmiro's
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whomever these people are, they know what they're doing," Basilio
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shook his head. "12 billion, Basilio, do you understand,"
          Casmiro stated angrily. "That's 12 billion... burnt down like it was
          nothing, 12 billion from the Marino warehouse under <i>your</i> care."
        </p>
        <p>
          Basilio swallowed. "I know. One of the soldiers gave very important
          info. These people call themselves 'STREET.' We aren't the first ones
          to get hit like this. They take so little and burn the rest. It
          started about three months ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't fucking care who they are. They can fuck with other families,
          but not Marino. <i>Never</i> Marino. How the fuck did they get under
          your noses."
        </p>
        <p>
          Basilio shrugged with uncertainty. "It's still a mystery. I would
          blame it on the Nazari's, but this operation was different. It
          was...perfect. Like a blink—and money gone—warehouse burnt—men dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio could feel Casmiro's anger from beside him but said nothing. He
          just kept staring at Basilio, who kept glancing at
          <i>The Wicked's</i> calm posture. Basilio was probably wondering why
          Elio was so quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had other business to take care of, and if it weren't for Casmiro's
          insistence, he would have been dining with the big-headed governor,
          thinking of new ways to sink his teeth further into the governmental
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this felt like child's play, and the last thing he wanted was to
          deal with children holding guns and sniffing drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          His tattooed fingers, designed with rings, came to raise the cigar
          stick from his mouth as he blew out a streak of smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And what makes you think the Nazaris have nothing to do with this? I
          don't think anyone would be foolish to touch us without a strong hand
          guiding them." Casmiro argued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basilio's face scrunched up with frustration. "Same thing I'm
          thinking. I say we take it to them; we make them pay for this hit."
        </p>
        <p>"And what if you're wrong."</p>
        <p>"No, believe me—I'm on to something—"</p>
        <p>
          Elio's gun unlocking from its safety, followed by a loud bang, was all
          that was heard next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basilio's lifeless head dropped to the table, blood seeping from the
          head wound.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fucking fuck did you just do!" Casmiro briefly forgot whom
          he was talking to. His tone raised in a yell.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Elio rose to his feet and pressed his cigar butt
          against the warm blood designing Basilio's table, the fire quenching
          in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We were on to something! The bastard was right... we're getting hit,
          one by fucking one, and they dared to mess with us."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you think the Nazari's are possible suspects?" Elio finally
          spoke, grabbing his suit and pulling it back on swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Rasheed Nazari knows better than to fuck with us like that, so I
          doubt it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio nodded once. "Do not go looking for trouble where there is none,
          Casmiro. I don't care about what we lost. All I want is to gain more.
          <b><i>Enfocar</i></b
          >, Casmiro. They are children throwing tantrums about not being big.
          Hm?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Italian was his first language. But his mother had taught him Spanish.
          Hence why he used Spanish whenever he didn't use English.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro hid his glare. "Why am I not surprised? You care less about
          the real business these days... Politics wasn't what our fathers
          chased, Marino."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio regarded him for a bit before speaking. "I am not my father. I am
          not your father. I don't know what it means to care less about
          something. Besides, I chase and crave power, and only power, Casmiro.
          Politics is power." He responded. "Have someone clean up this mess,"
          he fastened the two buttons of his suit as he asked. "where is
          Angelo?"
        </p>
        <p>"Overseeing some exchange at the casino."</p>
        <p>
          "Call him, tell him to drop it, and assign men to take over this
          place... I want business running here in a few hours." He ordered.
        </p>
        <p>At this, Casmiro's jaw clenched.</p>
        <p>"The occupants? Basilio's family?" Casmiro asked.</p>
        <p>
          Elio's emotionless eyes swept over his underboss. "Why ask? Wipe it
          all away. The sinner never exists if my bullet ends up inside them.
          Wife, children, Sister, brother, cousin, every damn soul connected to
          this man."
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro gave a curt nod, getting to his feet as well.</p>
        <p>
          About to walk out the door, Elio held him back by his arm. "Never.
          Ever. Raise your voice at me. The next time it happens, I'll feed you
          your vocal cords. <b><i>Claro</i></b
          >?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro didn't bat an eye. "<b><i>Lo Siento</i></b
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          They stayed that way for a few seconds, Elio's blank stare burning
          tight into Casmiro's glare, which was not letting up.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man shouldn't look at his boss like that. Elio knew it, and Casmiro
          did too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nodding, Elio let him pass, his gaze not leaving the man's back for
          one second.
        </p>
        <p>
          His apology meant nothing; Elio would have been a fool not to see it
          in his eyes. Casmiro was hanging on a thin thread with him... but Elio
          knew the man could handle things if he weren't around.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also knew the man disapproved of how he handled things—but Elio was
          okay with it; as long as his father consented, no other opinion
          mattered.

        <p><b>IS THERE</b> such a thing as having too much money?</p>
        <p>
          If there is, I'm not sure I want to be acquainted with that
          <i>thing</i> because who doesn't want to have too much money?
        </p>
        <p>
          The black coveralls I wore made me hot all over, and I could feel that
          one drop of sweat sliding down my back. My gaze roamed over the pool
          table before me; the endless dollar bundles had me staring in shock
          and, simultaneously, with a thrill that was too hard to hide from my
          face; correction—our faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The adrenaline from the job we had just returned from was still
          pumping through our veins because <i>this</i> was the biggest heist we
          had ever pulled. All five of us were still intact, with no casualties,
          no mistakes, and no regrets. It was fucking fantastic, and my grin was
          about to split my face in half.
        </p>
        <p>
          With gloved hands, I pulled my short hair away from my face, my tongue
          running over my bottom lip, unable to stop myself from shaking my head
          in disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bloody mental, what we just pulled." Upper grinned, his learned
          British accent coating his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog blew out a whistled breath, his dirty fingers rubbing his stubble
          as he looked up at each of us. "This is what I'm fucking talking
          about. To hell with shoplifting and home invasion. I want to keep
          hitting the people who have more than they should."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dog's right," Milk agreed, her pink hair still in a ponytail as she
          shrugged off her coverall, throwing it on one of the bean bags around
          us. "The thrill of hunting the people at the top of the food chain
          is—God, it's sweeter. So much money. Our vacation is ensured." Her
          lips curved into a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing the black gloves from my hands, I picked a bundle of money
          from the table, fingers skimming through it, the smell running right
          into my nostrils and straight to my head—no one told me the smell of
          new, fresh illegal money was like cocaine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arms wrapped around me from behind, followed by a kiss on my neck.
          Devil. He was a good 6'1over my 5'5. I could tell he was also grinning
          from ear to ear. "We should listen to Zahra more often." He murmured,
          and my grin spread wider when I leaned into him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the only one who answered my name. I didn't know any of their
          real names, and I doubted if they knew it too. Growing up in the
          streets, surrounded by people who stole and killed to eat, we were
          built from hard and harsh street dust.
        </p>
        <p>They each picked a name for themselves.</p>
        <p>
          Dog was Dog because that was what people called him when he was
          little. It was what people called him when he would steal to eat, when
          he would search the bins for that two-day-old slice of pizza or the
          burger with spoiled meat and dry mustard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper was Upper because he loved to climb. People called him the
          window thief because that was how he would get into people's homes and
          on top of people's roofs to watch them leave their houses so he could
          break in and take whatever was small and valuable enough to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk was Milk because she was soft and smooth. She could talk any man
          into doing her bidding, and it was a gift I would have killed for, but
          hell, it wasn't that easy. She was approachable and beautiful. Her
          skin was as clear as milk, and she compelled people with her smile and
          the seductive length of her lashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil was Devil because he had a mysterious and dark aura to everyone
          who didn't know him. He always wore black and knew how to handle
          weapons like a professional. He was hard-hearted when it was time to
          do something none of us would approve of but would have to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I, I was Zahra because I had an anklet with the name Zahra carved
          on the pendant. I never knew where it was from or who put it on me. I
          just knew it had always been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't too pretty; neither was I as alluring as Milk. I had short
          curly black hair that reached my chin. My skin wasn't as smooth as
          Milk's either because there were scars I never knew how I got and
          freckles I would have probably inherited from one of my parents,
          whomever they were. I was the shortest in the group, and I'd love to
          think I was the bravest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd jump into fire for any of them. I would stand in the front line
          when we were at battle, and I'd face off the strongest of men if a
          situation like that arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was bold, and I was fearless. When you spend every waking minute of
          your life with people who have the freedom to snuff the life out of
          you at any second, you'll also learn to be bold and fearless. Never
          cower when there's a gun pointed at your face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll prepare the bill counter," Dog said, rubbing his palms together
          as he disappeared to the small storage room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I'll get dinner; what do you fuckers feel up to?" Upper pulled
          off his coverall, took out his contact lenses, and carelessly flicked
          them to the ground for the next person who would bother to use the
          vacuum cleaner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We lived in a studio apartment that was never tidied and would
          probably get us arrested if the cops were to burst in here. But it was
          in the back of a not-so-popular kitchen in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil shot Upper a taunting smile, turning me around to face him. "Get
          us whatever, as long as it's not stolen,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oi, what the bloody hell do you mean by that, you wanker." Upper
          cursed, but there was a lightness to his voice that told anyone that
          this was just their normal way of communicating.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll go with him." Milk said, picking up another helmet before
          dashing after Upper, who grabbed his helmet from one of the worn-out
          couches by the side. He threw his arm around Milk's shoulder as they
          both bickered before walking out the door and out of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil grinned down at me. "How are you so amazing, hm?" he asked,
          pulling me to his body, lips trailing down my neck, with his hands
          going down my back to squeeze my ass.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed at him lightly, a small chuckle escaping me. "Stop; I'm
          sweaty and gross."
        </p>
        <p>"But that's us half the time, isn't it?"</p>
        <p>
          Our relationship wasn't defined. But we were together sexually and
          intimately. We didn't go down to talk about heart-to-heart stuff, but
          we knew we were both there if either of us wanted to talk.
        </p>
        <p>I smiled at him, genuinely grateful to have him by my side.</p>
        <p>"You really are amazing, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          I traced his jawline with my index finger. "I'm pretty sure when I was
          born, my mother or father said the word, 'amazing.' It grew with me, I
          guess."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh uhm." He murmured, pressing his lips to mine in a kiss. My lips
          parted to allow him entrance while my arms snaked around his shoulder,
          kissing him back.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lifted me, putting my body on the pool table, on top of the money,
          and hovered over me, balancing between my legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought we wouldn't be able to pull it off; it was a fantasy," I
          said in a whisper, still dazed from everything that went on tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm pretty sure we pissed off some really dangerous people tonight."
          Dog's voice rang through the space as he dropped the bill counter on
          the table, pulled up a chair, and sat down. "Ass off the table,
          Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned, getting off the table and teasingly stepping away from
          Devil as I walked backwards toward my room. "I'll go shower, don't
          start the fun without me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned, entered my room, and let out a breath as I walked to my bed
          and plopped down with a heavy, dreamy sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life was going well—as well as it could be for five skilled criminals
          who robbed criminals. I don't know how we could pull it off by a
          miracle, but somehow, the forces that ruled the world seemed to be on
          our side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat up with a smile, taking off my black sneakers—at the sight of my
          bare ankle where the golden anklet used to be, I paused in alarm.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit." I cursed silently.</p>
        <p>The anklet was missing.</p>
        <p>
          I immediately got to my feet, looking around my room to see if it
          might have fallen when I came in, but I wasn't an idiot; I knew it had
          somehow fallen off in our struggle to leave the burning building.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<i>Fuck</i>." I closed my eyes, my head thumping with a growing
          headache caused by worry. I knew there wasn't any way to go back for
          it; besides, it would have melted by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shoved it to the very back of my mind as I went to wash away the
          day's <i>crime from</i> my skin.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "I'm thinking, America." Milk said, her eyes dreamy as her hands waved
          apart an invisible landscaped picture of America. "I've always wanted
          to live that American dream, you know? With all this money, I could
          even open my hairline."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled at her, relaxing back on the bean bag as we thought about our
          next step after this. We'd always wanted to go on a one-year vacation
          away from Italy; we wanted to travel the world and see people and
          places we'd only heard of.
        </p>
        <p>
          The money we had gathered all together could last us more than three
          years, and though I knew we could never have too much money, the break
          was something we all needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitting one of <b><i>il Malvagio's</i></b> warehouses was the biggest
          risk we had ever taken; we had made a pact before we left that if we
          pulled it off, we would all go on a vacation together and live our
          lives like royalty.
        </p>
        <p>I was really looking forward to it.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh yes, America. Imagine living there." Dog said. "Los Angeles, the
          city of angels; Miami, the city of tits."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't help but laugh; the dim lights around us and the small
          fireplace cackles made the whole atmosphere seem intimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, it always was with this crew; we were each other's
          families and lifelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isn't America overrated?" Upper asked, playing lazily with the
          Rubik's cube in his grip. "I hear that it is."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We could go to Hawaii." I chipped in. "I've heard it's beautiful
          there."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And dreamy," Milk added. "I've also heard hot men are walking around
          with those beach shirts that they leave unbuttoned to show off their
          chest hair, yum."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why is everything about sex and men to you?" Upper asked her,
          sounding irritated.
        </p>
        <p>"Who said anything about sex?"</p>
        <p>"Hairy-chested hot men equal sex, Milk."</p>
        <p>"You're the one thinking about sex with—"</p>
        <p>
          "Or maybe we could travel around," Devil cut in before an argument had
          the chance to arrive. "Spend a month in each city, buy a house in a
          few countries, and live like the world has always been in our favor.
          We don't have to overthink it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I directed my smile at him this time. "Yeah," I backed him up. "Let's
          just make the most of it because when we come back, we're gonna rain
          hell on these—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Something shattered in the distance, cutting me off, and we all sat
          up, ultimately quiet for almost a minute to listen for any suspicious
          noise. But it was radio silent.
        </p>
        <p>Dog frowned. "What the hell was—"</p>
        <p>
          Our door exploded with a force that had my heart almost leaving my
          chest. Masked men rushed into our intimate space before White smoke
          filled the air, and I suddenly felt so sleepy; I couldn't see a single
          thing but blurry black figures all around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could hear Devil shouting my name; I could also hear gunshots,
          bone-breaking kicks, and grunts—more ear-numbing gunshots and Milk's
          terrified screams. I tried to get to her, but my lungs felt so heavy I
          couldn't breathe.
        </p>
        <p>Come on, Zahra, get up. <i>Get up</i></p>
        <p>
          I fought to get on my knees and managed to open my eyes, only to be
          met by the end of a gun quickly approaching my face.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't get to feel the pain before I was out like a light.</p>

        <p><br /><br />_______<br /><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>THERE WAS</b> a ringing in my ear when I regained consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          My throat was dry, and my skin burned like hell was right beside me. I
          could feel sweat rolling down my face, beading at the skin between my
          nose and lips, and sliding down my legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to open my eyes, but the thundering headache in my head had me
          wincing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision was blurry for the first few seconds, but I soon adjusted to
          the empty wall before and all around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breathing through my nose was difficult because the air was burning
          hot, it was thick and dry, and I was dehydrated. So, I opened my mouth
          and breathed through there, feeling the burn in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to cry and scream at how uncomfortable I felt.</p>
        <p>It was almost as if the air was suffocating me.</p>
        <p>
          I tried to move my body, but I couldn't, and with the pounding in my
          head, It took me a good while to realize my legs were tied to the
          chair I was sitting on; my hands also felt unmovable from where it was
          tied behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a shaky breath, fear gripping my bones for the first time in
          years. I hadn't felt like this since I was eight, scared and alone;
          I'd almost forgotten what fear felt like.
        </p>
        <p>
          The room was too fucking hot, there was no window for ventilation, and
          I could smell the tangy odor of something dead, of piss, of dried
          vomit—of torture.
        </p>
        <p>This room was torture without being tortured.</p>
        <p>
          I breathed with my mouth, but I was so thirsty; my breath was so
          thick.
        </p>
        <p>"Calm Zahra, calm, get a hold of yourself," I whispered.</p>
        <p>
          Sweat dripped down my chin, and I moved my head to my shoulder, wiping
          the irritating moisture away with my damp shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands were numb, and I couldn't feel my fingers due to how tight my
          wrists had been tied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a door opened, and I looked up, completely freezing, when I
          saw who approached me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had seen his face in magazines, the news, and the internet, but I
          never thought there would come a day when I would actually come face
          to face with <b><i>I Malvagi</i></b
          >himself. The Mob boss of the Marino syndicate was standing before me,
          hand tucked into his pockets as his eyes scanned my form from head to
          toe.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are so little." His voice was deep and accented, a little muffled
          in a room that was supposed to echo.
        </p>
        <p>It was the heat. The heat was sucking all the air in the room.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze settled firm on his. "Oh wow—the boss came to say hi
          him—himself," I croaked out, my voice cracked and faint as I breathed.
          "Can I—can I bother you with a request for water?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, his brows pulled down in a frown as he tilted his head to the
          side, the tattoo on his neck peeking out of the collar of his dress
          shirt. "Are you thirsty?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed a nod, still breathing with my mouth; it was noisy and
          fucking embarrassing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She's thirsty," he mocked, bending slightly until he was face level
          with me. "Is the room too hot for you? Does it feel like you're drying
          up?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Annoyance bubbled in my stomach at the way he was speaking to me. Like
          a fucking kid. I wanted to tell him to eat shit so badly. But I was
          too fucking thirsty.
        </p>
        <p>"Now you know how my money felt when that fire started." He said.</p>
        <p>
          I hated the tears building in my eyes and the way my body shook. I
          hated how vulnerable I was right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you did not have the resources to take all the money, you could
          have just left the rest. Or did your employer ask you to do it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't respond because my throat was dry, and I might just pass out
          if I exerted my energy. I was also sure this room would bake a loaf of
          bread if the raw form of the flour were shoved in.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay." His voice rang out again.</p>
        <p>
          Elio Marino raised to his full height now, and my eyes burned when I
          tried to follow his movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          His face was void of all emotions as he brought his hands out of his
          pockets and clapped once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immediately, the door opened, and someone walked in with a bottle of
          water and a gun. They handed it to him before swiftly leaving the room
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could see the tiny beads of sweat on his forehead as he looked at me
          again. "Water?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The fight left me at the sight of the chilled water, and I swallowed,
          "<i>Please</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, gently placed the gun on my lap, and uncapped the water
          bottle slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he bent again, held my face in his hand, brought the bottle to my
          lips, and poured the water at the surface of my lips so that it didn't
          enter my mouth. His grip on my face tightened to a painful hold as he
          raised the bottle to my nose, pouring the water into my nostrils.
        </p>
        <p>
          My body fought to escape the brutal attack, choking and gurgling
          sounds leaving my throat and mouth. My eyes widened as tears fell from
          the corners while I struggled for air.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could see how my struggle pleased him. He looked so relaxed while I
          fought to breathe. My chest constricted, my body picking on a dull
          buzz, and when my eyes started to see him in a painful blur, he let me
          go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I coughed hot air back into my lungs and bent to allow the water that
          hadn't gotten to my head to slip out of my nose.
        </p>
        <p>The sickest part of all this was that I still felt thirsty.</p>
        <p>
          "My hand slipped," his voice rang out again, calm and collected like
          he wasn't also feeling the lack of oxygen in the room. "It does that
          sometimes."
        </p>
        <p>
          He threw the almost empty bottle to the ground and took his gun from
          my lap, removing it from the safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head felt lighter, and my left ear rang so loud I feared I would
          never hear again. The water must have found its way into my ear.
          "What—what the <i>fuck</i> do you—want from me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't speak for what felt like a minute before he began to circle
          me. "I want to know whom you work for. Give me a name, and I promise
          only to put you in a coma and not kill you."
        </p>
        <p>At this, I frowned. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          He stopped right in front of me. "I hate repeating myself, Zahra." He
          said my name, and my body went rigid. "It's tiring, this room is too
          hot, and the stench is killing me. So, speak, and let us be done with
          this."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't work for anyone."</p>
        <p>"Not what I want to hear, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          "It's the truth. My—my crew and I—we—we work alone. Wait—Where are
          they?" I asked, my heart thumping so hard against my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything that happened when we were attacked was still light in my
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio stepped closer to me and bent down again as his eyes roamed my
          face. "Dead, alive, being tortured as we speak, who fucking cares.
          Tell me what I need to know, and stop. Wasting. My fucking. Time."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I already told you." I gritted out. "I work for no one! We know no
          one but each other. If it's your money you want, as you already know,
          we took a few and burnt down the rest; we can return what we took—we
          can—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You do not want to lie to me, Zahra; I am a liar who hates liars."
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed my eyes to lock directly with his. "Doesn't—doesn't that
          mean you're lying right now?"
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "If you hate liars—and you are a liar, doesn't that mean you hate
          yourself?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His dark eyes moved between mine—if I wasn't tied to a chair, probably
          about to die, I would have commended the way he stopped his thoughts
          from resurfacing on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, standing up straight. "You think I am here to play
          psychology with you."
        </p>
        <p>"That wasn't—"</p>
        <p>
          He raised his gun, and I heard a loud bang before I felt the pain
          spread from my shoulder to my whole body. It was as if my breath had
          been sucked out of my lungs. The cry that left my mouth was harsh and
          hoarse.
        </p>
        <p><i>The bastard shot me. </i></p>
        <p>
          For the first time, his eyes turned hard as he leaned in again,
          placing his gun-free hand on the shoulder he just shot, his thumb
          finger pressing against the wound leaking blood. "Now, I ask again—"
          through my blood and sweat-soaked shirt, his thumb dug deeper into the
          wound as if fishing to find the bullet.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gahhh, fuck!" I yelled. The pain was blinding, and I was grounding my
          teeth together as tears poured down my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Who paid you to fuck with me."</p>
        <p>
          "NO ONE!" I screamed as anger and pain mixed with my bloodstream when
          he twisted his thumb in my wound. "Please—please stop! I swear we did
          it alone—fuck!" my lips trembled.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't lie to me,"</p>
        <p>
          He twisted it again, and I squirmed and bit back a sob at the pain
          that had me lightheaded—I felt like I was losing consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>"Talk."</p>
        <p>
          "Why—<i>why</i> would I fucking lie! You are the fucking Wicked.
          People fear you—more than anyone—in this—business—no one could pay me
          a million dollars to fuck with you—no one but myself. As we have done
          before, I trusted myself to do this without any casualties, and my
          people trusted me. No one sent my team or me—we did it on our own
          accord—because we could."
        </p>
        <p>Then there was silence.</p>
        <p>"Fair point." He simply said, releasing me.</p>
        <p>I sucked in a breath as more tears ran down my cheeks.</p>
        <p>
          He straightened again, looking away from me and wiping his forehead.
          "This is a waste of my time." He muttered under his breath before
          looking back at me. "How can you all be so stupid to steal from
          someone like me? You thought you could get away with it?"
        </p>
        <p>"We did," I said before I could stop myself.</p>
        <p>
          "Angelo!" He yelled into the silence, and the door opened again, and
          someone came walking in, composure in place, his eyes moving to me for
          a swift second before they settled on Elio.
        </p>
        <p>"Boss," he said.</p>
        <p>
          "Qué dije?" <i>What did I say? </i> Elio had a tiny edge to his voice
          that almost had me believing he was angry. His voice, though, was
          calm. "Didn't I say they were lone rangers? But Casmiro knows best,
          no? Now I have wasted my time and my resources."
        </p>
        <p>"Debo llamar a Casmiro?" <i>Should I call Casmiro? </i></p>
        <p>
          "Leave it. There is no point in dragging out something that doesn't
          deserve the time and energy. Kill all of them, make this one watch,
          and then kill her too. Before you do that, increase the heat enough to
          make the skin burn, it is only right to prepare the sinner for what
          awaits them after death."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo nodded, gaze sweeping in my direction again. His eyes showed no
          form of hesitation, and I knew he would follow through with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio handed the gun to Angelo, adjusting his collar before turning and
          walking towards the entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, no, no, I can't let it end like this. There must be
          something—anything—there—
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're making a mistake!" my voice rang out in desperation, and Elio
          stopped.
        </p>
        <p>Angelo's brows shot up in surprise as he turned toward Elio.</p>
        <p>
          Slowly—ever so slowly, Elio turned to me, his brows dropped in
          confusion. I understood that expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone in my position would be begging for their lives, but me? I
          wanted to make a proposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio took a few steps back to me. "I am making a mistake?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes. If you kill us, you'll be making a big mistake."</p>
        <p>"Pray to tell <i>why</i> you think this?"</p>
        <p>I swallowed. "I can help you."</p>
        <p>Elio's gaze moved to Angelo's interested one.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, this is a first," Elio said, looking back down at me. "Why
          would I want the help of a twelve-year-old girl?"
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, a scowl was all my face could muster. "I'm twenty-four." I
          bit out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's eyes widened. "You look twelve—too short—small face—annoying
          voice—short hair."
        </p>
        <p>"My choice," I replied almost immediately.</p>
        <p>
          There was a short silence before he nodded. "Okay, Sport, I'll bite.
          What does that little head of yours think it can help me with?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "My people and I are efficient, fast, and skilled. We can go in and
          out of a building without getting seen. I know your syndicate has a
          legal face, but you should know that sometimes, you must mix the legal
          with the illegal. We are like shadows, and we can slip into your legal
          spaces and turn things to your favor without anyone ever guessing you
          might have been involved—if you know what I mean."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio nodded. "Hm." He shoved both hands into his pocket again.
          "Everything you just said would have been a compelling reason to keep
          you and your people alive if you weren't tied up in a chair after
          being embarrassingly caught by me."
        </p>
        <p>"That wouldn't have happened if I didn't leave something behind."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes widened a fraction in surprise. "You know your mistakes."
        </p>
        <p>"And I know better than to make them again."</p>
        <p>
          Elio looked like he was pondering hard, but it barely crossed his
          face. "So, you agree to be indebted to me for the rest of your life?"
        </p>
        <p>"If that is what it takes to stay alive, then yes."</p>
        <p>"You speak for your whole...crew?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          Elio nodded, almost as if he had just realized something. His gaze
          settled on Angelo. "Turn up the heat until she can't breathe, record
          it."
        </p>
        <p>Fucking hell.</p>
        <p>"And the others?" Angelo asked.</p>
        <p>
          Elio glanced my way, his eyes moving from my head to my toe before he
          spoke. "Make them watch."
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a defeated breath as I tried to wiggle my way out of the
          hold on the chair, my shoulder burning away with pain. "Please!" I
          cried out pathetically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio turned, walking out of the room without a second glance. Angelo
          followed seconds after him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was panting, shivering in fear and anger as the heat became
          unbearable—I groaned in pain—the plastic of water on the ground was
          melting by second—The wound on my shoulder was burning—and I was
          screaming and crying and begging—again and again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to think if I ever was in a situation like this, I would face
          it with equal confidence and silence; I used to think I wouldn't beg
          for my life—I used to think I wouldn't fear death.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here, in this room, alone with my misery and pain, I was trapped
          in that little girl's body again—the girl who was too small for the
          world, the girl who was trapped in a hot cabinet and was forgotten
          about until someone stumbled upon her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was that girl again—except this time—I locked myself in this
          cabinet, and no one was coming for me.

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I SETTLED</b> the cigar between my lips and flicked open the red
          lighter, allowing the flames light up the shaft's end before flicking
          it shut and slipping it back into my pocket. I sucked in the thick
          smoke, taking the stick from my mouth while playing around with the
          hotness against my tongue before letting the smoke out of my mouth,
          allowing it calm my nerves.
        </p>
        <p>Slipping the cigar back between my lips, I poured myself a drink.</p>
        <p>
          "What were you thinking?" Casmiro's voice alerted me to his presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You forget yourself sometimes, Casmiro," I said, dropping the whiskey
          bottle and picking up my glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're keeping them alive?" He ignored my statement, his eyes burning
          with anger and disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What can I say? Being wicked was getting old." I told him while
          taking out the cigarette, allowing the drink warm me up instead.
        </p>
        <p>"This isn't funny, Marino."</p>
        <p>"Yes, I know. I would be laughing if it was."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro took a step closer to me. "They stole from our family, and you
          let them live. Why?"
        </p>
        <p>I shrugged. "Because they stole from me."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro frowned in confusion. "What the fuck does that even mean? I
          don't understand."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "You think with your anger; that is why you don't
          understand things. I wonder how you made it this far with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro glared now, taking off his suit jacket and carelessly throwing
          it on a couch by the side before walking to the bar area of my home
          lounge, picking up a glass, and pouring himself a drink. My gaze kept
          going to the mess he made with his suit, but I hid my irritation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He freed his tie from its hold around his neck. "Keeping them alive is
          not something you would do. I'm only confused." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fair. I see potential in a partnership with them. Besides, they don't
          know I'm keeping them alive. I left them with their assumptions. It
          kills faster than death itself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shook his head, raising his glass to me. "Only you, Marino.
          Only you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "They have guts—and determination—I could tell from the
          little one I spoke to."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra?"</p>
        <p>"Hm. Do you have the full name yet?"</p>
        <p>
          Dropping his glass to the table, he nodded. "Her last name is Faizan."
        </p>
        <p>"Born here?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No, Saudi Arabia. She was bought and abandoned,
          couldn't dig up much about her after Italy."
        </p>
        <p>"Parents?"</p>
        <p>"Father unknown, mother married with four children."</p>
        <p>"In Saudi?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"And the others?"</p>
        <p>
          "I already sent you all the information you should need about them,
          but I know you won't read it, so—Pink-haired girl who calls herself
          Milk is an orphan and was in foster care before migrating to a small
          gang family where she met Zahra. The gang is still active, but when we
          reached out, they refused all claims to them. They're lone rangers.
          The three boys, Devil, Upper, and Dog, were also a part of that gang.
          Upper and Dog are orphans. Devil's background is still unclear; the
          background check we ran on him was void."
        </p>
        <p>"Void?"</p>
        <p>"He's a ghost."</p>
        <p>
          I brought the already burnt-out cigarette to my mouth, sucked it in,
          and quenched the fire on the ashtray. "Hm. No childhood pictures,
          surveillance cameras, webcam images?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "None. He's not in any database. Medical records are also zero, and
          criminal records are clear—no legal name to pin him to like the
          others. And we can't exactly run a check on a nickname. It makes it
          difficult because that face isn't on the system."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Interesting, We should keep an eye on that one."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro grunted. "I don't think we should be keeping eyes on any of
          them. They should be dead."
        </p>
        <p>"They are useful."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shook his head. "Useful in what sense? We have guys who can
          steal for you and would never be seen doing it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This street people stole from those <i>same</i> guys and weren't seen
          by them. They locked us out of our security system for two hours after
          they left, and they had the guts to do all of that and were still
          successful."
        </p>
        <p>"We caught them." He pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          "Because they left something behind. The jewelry. They know it too."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't think this is wise, Marino."</p>
        <p>
          "I think it is. They are under Marino's command now. They are not our
          people but believable assets we can use. Political wise."
        </p>
        <p>"There we go," Casmiro mumbled.</p>
        <p>
          "What? These men in the big seats only listen to the command of power,
          Casmiro. You might not see the use of politics. But the Marino empire
          is legal, thanks to me. We can touch the government and political
          bodies and be so big that future accusations without proof would brush
          past the media in a swoosh no one would see. Our fathers never thought
          of this because they were old-fashioned. They were scared little
          pussies who didn't dare to branch out of their comfort zone." I said
          to him, drinking the rest of the whiskey in my glass and dropping the
          empty glass on the counter.
        </p>
        <p>It was silent after that—surprisingly, not a comfortable one.</p>
        <p>
          I watched Casmiro's jaw clench and unclench, still looking at the
          collection of whiskeys and wine before him as he spoke. "Then let me
          in."
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my tongue to stop the words about to come out of
          my mouth; then I turned to pour myself another round, looking away
          from him, when I felt his gaze at the side of my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But you won't...." Casmiro trailed off before turning fully to me.
          "You won't because you don't trust me—because, for some reason, you
          choose not to. I would have accepted that if there had been a time
          when I did something to break your trust in me, but I never did. You
          just stopped."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't trust anyone, Casmiro. Don't make this personal."</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck you, E. I am making it fucking personal.
          <b><i>Usted es mi hermano, Mi única familia.</i></b
          >" <i>You are my brother, my only family.</i>
        </p>
        <p>"Casmiro—"</p>
        <p>
          "I am tired of you treating me like one of your soldiers. You make me
          feel alone in all of this. It was supposed to be two of us. Against
          everyone. But you fucking treat me like an outsider."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's accent wasn't as pronounced as mine was. But right now, it
          was thick with useless emotions, making his accent touch every word he
          uttered.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was times like this I didn't know what to do. Yes, we used to be
          close, but why couldn't he understand that things change? These days,
          there was no such thing as brothers, friends, or even family when it
          came to business. Why couldn't he understand that I would kill him if
          necessary? Brothers do not think that about their brothers, do they?
        </p>
        <p><i>I am confused.</i></p>
        <p>
          I watched him swallow down the last of his drink, shaking his head and
          dropping the glass on the table as he began to walk away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Casmiro," I called, but he ignored me. He reached the couch he had
          dumped his suit, swiftly picked it up, and wore it before attempting
          to walk out. "Stop," I called out again, leaving my glass on the table
          as I approached him. "Sit."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me and then at the couch before looking back at me. "I
          have shit to do."
        </p>
        <p>"Sit down, Casmiro."</p>
        <p>Casmiro hesitated but succumbed with a grunt.</p>
        <p>
          Sitting down next to him on the couch, I waited a bit before raising
          my hand to ruffle his hair like I used to. "You are like a little
          child sometimes."
        </p>
        <p>
          He pushed my hand away lightly, a scowl on his face. "Cut it out.
          <b><i>Estoy enojado</i></b
          >." <i>I'm angry.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "<b><i>¿De Verdad?</i></b> " <i>Really?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          He threw a stern frown at me. "<b><i>Si</i></b
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "Useless emotions, Casmiro. This kind of heart you have
          isn't what this business needs."
        </p>
        <p>"Did you ask me to sit so you could insult me?"</p>
        <p>
          "No." I took in a sharp breath. "Listen. You cannot throw tantrums
          like this because we don't drink whisky together and do shit that
          brothers do. You said I treat you like a soldier. But I don't think
          any soldier would have the guts to walk in here and pour himself a
          drink. I don't think I would sit down with a soldier and talk to him
          like I am talking to you now. You assume I do not care because that is
          what you see."
        </p>
        <p>"It's what you show."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Because a time will come when I will have to choose between you
          and something I want badly, and I will choose that without blinking.
          It is not that I don't trust you. I don't trust myself. So, I want you
          to reduce your expectations of me because I cannot be a brother to
          you, Casmiro. I will fuck it up, and you will hate me."
        </p>
        <p>This time, all I saw on his face was confusion.</p>
        <p>"How can you be so certain you will fuck it up?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because I am sick. I am unpredictable, even to myself. I do not know
          consequences until it hits me in the face. This is me being very
          honest with you because I can tell—my behavior is drawing up an
          unfixable rift between us. I only want you to understand this."
        </p>
        <p>"I hate your honesty sometimes."</p>
        <p>
          "I am not an honest man, Casmiro. I tell you what you want to hear,
          and I know you wanted the truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded and was silent for a few seconds before he broke it. "I
          still want you to let me in—"
        </p>
        <p>"Casmiro—"</p>
        <p>
          "Try. Let's take power together. Teach me. You can do it alone, but
          you don't have to. Not when I'm here."
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked my jaw, refusing to give myself unnecessary time to think it
          through. <i>It is not as if I didn't warn him. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay." I voiced. "You want to get inside my head. You want me to tell
          you things and trust you. You want to make a brother off me. fine."
        </p>
        <p>"Why do you make it sound so scary?"</p>
        <p>"It is the accent."</p>
        <p>
          There was a slight pause before Casmiro blinked. "I think you just
          made a joke—but your face isn't—it's not—"
        </p>
        <p>"I know. I am funny."</p>
        <p>
          "It's hard to tell if you're telling a joke or—just being <i>you</i>.
          Before, it never used to be hard to tell; you made everyone laugh
          until that day."
        </p>
        <p>"Ah yes, the beating."</p>
        <p>
          "<b><i>Si</i></b
          >." <i>yes</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          A comfortable silence passed, and my brain was still catching up to
          this new development before he spoke again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I just want things to return to how they were, you know? I don't want
          secrets between us. Whatever we're doing, we do it together, like
          brothers."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "Okay, Casmiro. No secrets. But remember, I warned you. You
          don't get to complain that I am overbearing or talkative."
        </p>
        <p>
          He scoffed. "A talkative is the last thing I would call you, E. Even
          when we were children, you only talked when it was necessary or when
          you were excited. I can't remember the last time I saw you excited
          about anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "That is true. But I get excited about things." Then I
          pointed to the side of my head. "In my head. I also talk my mind off
          in my head. But now that you have offered your ears," I got to my
          feet, motioning to the home office a few feet away from us. "Let's go
          talk politics, <b><i>hermano</i></b
          >."

        <p>_______<br /><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I WOKE</b> in a start, making me move my shoulder in a way that
          sent sharp pains down my arm. "Motherfucker." I gritted in pain,
          realizing I was lying on a soft mattress. My head rested atop
          comfortable pillows stacked up to ensure I didn't cause any discomfort
          to myself when I woke up—apparently, that didn't work.
        </p>
        <p>My left hand was in a firm sling, and I was in new clothes.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Devil's voice had me looking up in a start; he was leaning on
          the wall next to the small table across from me, arms crossed against
          his chest, watching me like a dark shadow, dressed in all black.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey creep, why are you way over there?"</p>
        <p>
          A small, strained smile tugged at his lips as He approached me,
          getting on the side of the big bed, "How are you feeling?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes took in the bruise on his cheek. Other than that, he didn't
          seem injured anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Like death." I croaked out, trying to sit up. He was quick to help
          me, but I moved my arm wrongly and winced at the spike of pain. "Ugh,
          fuck—this hurts like a motherfucker."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know. It's going to leave a scar. They took the bullet out, but it
          was difficult because of how deep it was in your shoulder; they had to
          tear—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't tell me. I'll probably ink it when it heals." I said, letting
          out a shaky breath. "How are you? Where are the others? Where are we?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I took in my surroundings more clearly again. It looked like a decent
          room for guests, as no personal belongings were lying around. But none
          of this made sense. I shouldn't be alive—none of us should be alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where else would we be?" his tone was sharp; the edge in his voice
          had me frowning. He sighed, looking down at the sling on my arm.
          "Sorry, we're still hostages—except we aren't locked up. We were given
          a quarter in the compound. We're in Marino territory."
        </p>
        <p>
          I slumped slightly, careful not to move my arm. "Fuck—the others
          they—"
        </p>
        <p>"Are pissed. Just a heads up."</p>
        <p>
          There was only one reason why they could be pissed at me. I told Elio
          we would forever be at his service as long as he kept us alive. When
          he left me in that fucking oven, I didn't think for one second that I
          would make it out of there alive. He hadn't given me any guarantee
          that he approved of my proposal to be at his service, so it made no
          sense—or maybe my brain was still filled with the water he had almost
          drowned me in.
        </p>
        <p>Water—</p>
        <p>
          It was almost like the thought of water reminded me of how thirsty I
          had been before I probably passed out from all my pathetic screaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cringed—embarrassed that I had let myself go like that—that I had
          forgotten how to be strong.
        </p>
        <p>"Can I get water?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          Devil's eyes softened as he got up from the bed to the table across
          the room. He poured water into a glass and brought it over to me. I
          collected it eagerly with my good hand before bringing it to my lips,
          drinking it all in just five gulps.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a tense awkwardness in the air between Devil and me. It was
          unfamiliar, but I knew where it came from; it was probably why I felt
          ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the glass on the bedside table. "How did we get here? Was I
          the only one questioned?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah. For some reason, you were the only one they wanted to talk to."
        </p>
        <p>My anklet.</p>
        <p>
          "I take it you watched—everything—me?" I asked, a little part of me
          hoping those bastards didn't really make them watch how I screamed and
          begged.
        </p>
        <p>Devil was quiet, and it only confirmed my suspicion.</p>
        <p>
          Carefully, I relaxed back on the bedhead, watching him refusing to
          meet my gaze. "Is that why you're being awkward? Because the
          <i>amazing</i> Zahra you knew would have never begged, cried, or
          screamed while she was basically being toasted alive."
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised his head, gaze snapping to mine in a second as he blinked
          his thoughts away. "What the fuck? No. Never—I don't—it's not you—" he
          breathed. "They made us watch. They tied us up and made us watch, and
          it was fucking torture, not being able to—" his voice shook. "To do
          anything. It was cruel, Zahra. I can still see, hear, and feel the
          anger. I hate myself for not seeing this happening, for not talking us
          out of going through with the Marino mission—we should have known."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "No, this isn't your fault. If anyone's to blame,
          it's me. I brought the idea—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I egged you on; I provided the layout; I made it easier. Milk
          seduced one of the soldiers, and we got electronic access; Upper
          fucked with their systems and locked them out; Dog took the men
          guarding the warehouse down, one by one. This shit? It's on all of
          us."
        </p>
        <p>"But they're pissed at me."</p>
        <p>
          "Because you told Elio you speak for us. You basically signed off all
          our lives to him."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked in disbelief. "There was nothing else I could have done,
          Devil; he could have killed us all—he could have—we wouldn't be alive
          right now if it weren't for me. I did what I fucking had to do. Do you
          think if it were just me, I would grovel like a fucking pussy? My
          head, thoughts, mind, and heart were on all of you. I don't give a
          fuck about my life; he could put a fucking bullet in my head as long
          as I know you all are far away from him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not blaming you for it, Zahra; I would have done the same thing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But apparently, those shitheads wouldn't—fuck this." I was already
          getting off the bed, ignoring how my body felt heavy, and my arm
          seemed to hurt at my sudden movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was pissed; I was pissed because what the hell were
          <i>they</i> angry about? I was the one who was tortured; I was the one
          who was being baked alive; I was the one who saved their sorry little
          fucking asses.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, slow down," Devil complained.</p>
        <p>
          But I was already out of the room; hearing their voices muffled, I
          followed in that direction to get to them. It didn't take long before
          I found myself in a space resembling a kitchen. "Okay, motherfuckers
          let's hear it. Why whine behind my fucking back when you can say it to
          my face?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I was met with silence. But I watched how Dog's expression turned into
          a hard glare; he had a cut on his brow that was already stitched up.
          Upper had a scowl on his face, but I could tell it was only directed
          at the situation, and Milk had a bandage on her arm, but her face was
          as flawless as ever; I couldn't read her emotions because she wouldn't
          meet my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You wanna pick a fight?" Dog asked. "Cause I'm ready to give it to
          you; I don't care if you have a busted arm."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil came up beside me, sighing. "Guys, the last thing we need right
          now is a baseless disagreement."
        </p>
        <p>"Baseless? We are fucked—we're all fucked." Upper spoke up.</p>
        <p>"No more American dream." Milk's voice was quiet.</p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck else was I supposed to do? He was going to kill you
          all—I had to do what I had to do, so yes, I spoke for us at that
          moment."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Really? Who the fuck put you in charge? Because last I checked, we
          don't have a <i>boss</i> on this team." Dog said, coming closer. "This
          is your problem Zahra; you always love to play the hero; it's probably
          why they picked you and shot you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed. "We got caught because of me. That's why they picked me and
          <i>shot</i> me. I left something behind. They probably found it."
        </p>
        <p>
          After I said that, it went very quiet around us, and I could see them
          all giving me questioning looks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit," Devil said from beside me. "I was wondering where your anklet
          ran off to."
        </p>
        <p>
          His response answered the question of who changed my clothes. I was on
          a shirt too big to be my size.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you bloody joking!" Upper exclaimed. "We made a mistake?"</p>
        <p>
          "Funny how that's what you're worried about when we would never get to
          see America ever again." Milk bit out at Upper.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Would you shut the fuck up about America for one goddam minute?" Dog
          said to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk stood upright with a frown shot straight at Dog, who maintained
          his glare now directed at her. "Don't tell me to shut up. You're the
          one who's been whining about being chained up like the dog you used to
          be."
        </p>
        <p>"Guys—" Devil tried to cut in.</p>
        <p>
          "How could we have made a mistake? How could we have missed something?
          That never happens." Upper mused out loud.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss hero probably took it off herself so she could sell us all out
          and keep the prize money to herself." Dog injected.
        </p>
        <p>And the accusation slapped me in the face.</p>
        <p>
          "You're <i>so</i> fucking stupid, Dog. I am trapped too! I get it. I'm
          short as fuck, but there's no way I can sneak my way out of this
          compound without being shot in the head. Besides, why would they leave
          the money back at the studio? It belongs to them now."
        </p>
        <p>"Guys, stop—"</p>
        <p>
          "Just like we belong to them, thanks to you!" Dog yelled back. "I
          don't give a fuck if he could have killed us all—I'd die happy knowing
          that I didn't have to live my life committing crimes for anyone
          again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too; you also kind of did bring the idea to go for Marino, so..."
          Milk added.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a humorless laugh. "Oh, you guys are ungrateful pieces of
          shit. I really should have just let every single one of us die because
          I can't believe I brought down my fucking pride, begging for our
          lives, only to survive this shit to see how fucking terrible the
          people I consider family are!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog groaned. "Don't you fucking pull the family card because that
          doesn't have shit to do with—"
        </p>
        <p>"It has <i>everything</i> to do with—"</p>
        <p>"I can't believe we made a mistake—"</p>
        <p>"It was supposed to be our vacation time—"</p>
        <p>
          "TIME OUT! TIME FUCKING OUT!" Devil yelled, and I almost jumped out of
          my skin as everyone else kept quiet. "We have a bigger fish to fry,
          okay? The last thing we should be worried about is the mistake we
          made, or the stupid vacation, or the life sentence, or our fucking
          pride. We're here, and that's done. We should be thinking about how to
          keep our heads above water."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog shook his head, returning to stand behind the counter, rubbing his
          palm down his face as the quietness seeped in.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't care what any of you think you know—but E—Marino is not a
          merciful man. Do you think he would just send someone to shoot you if
          he wanted to kill you? No, he would send people to do it slowly and
          painfully until we beg for death. Zahra saved us from that shit. She
          took the pain for us—"
        </p>
        <p>I cut him off. "I don't need you to—"</p>
        <p>"Would you keep quiet?"</p>
        <p>
          I would punch him if my left hand weren't in a sling. Then again, I
          knew he was going somewhere, so I let him finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No matter how angry we are right now, I have no doubt we would have
          done the same thing if we were put in that position. It's who we are.
          We are family. We do our best to make sure we survive to see another
          day. Just because we're here now doesn't mean our life is done. We're
          smart; we're fucking <i>STREET</i>. There's no way we aren't going to
          wiggle out of this. I can't guarantee our freedom if we turn our backs
          on each other now, if we point fingers, fight, and hold grudges. We
          need to trust each other now more than ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          He was right, and I felt the anger that was once boiling in my blood
          dissipate; almost the same time, Upper sighed, leaving his position
          and holding a marker pen. "I've always wanted to sign on an arm
          sling."
        </p>
        <p>"Where did you even get the pen?"</p>
        <p>
          "It was lying around." He smiled softly at me as he signed on to my
          sling. "Sorry, you got shot. Was it cool? Even a little bit?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, just a little—not cool enough to take another one ever
          again—but it has its cool side." I smiled at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He returned the smile, handing the pen to Milk, who was already behind
          him, before stepping away to the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't watch," Milk said quietly. "I only heard—I'm sorry you went
          through that. I don't think I would have lasted that long."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was glad she didn't go through any of what I did. Milk's skin was
          too soft, just like her heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If it's any consolation, I just wanted to make those bastards deaf;
          at least I could have had that before they killed me."
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, smiling as she signed on my cast, not bothering to
          give it to Dog, who was still behind the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few seconds passed before he stepped out and walked up to me. I
          thought he would curse at me and walk out because that was a typical
          Dog move, but instead, he pulled me to his tense body, careful not to
          hurt my arm, his hand settling at the back of my head as I relaxed
          into his hold. "I'm sorry," he whispered to me. "I didn't mean the
          shit I said."
        </p>
        <p>"I know."</p>
        <p>
          "I just didn't want to admit that I cried like a helpless idiot seeing
          you in there, suffering—did you really have to scream that loud?"
        </p>
        <p>"I was baking—so yeah, kinda," I said too.</p>
        <p>
          "I wanna punch that Marino bastard so bad; I just wanna draw blood
          from him, you know."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "I know, Dog. I want to punch him too—but we can't."</p>
        <p>
          "We can't." he echoed back. Releasing me, his eyes glancing at the
          sling on my arm. "I'm not signing that shit."
        </p>
        <p>"Got it." I chuckled.</p>
        <p>"So, what's next?" Upper asked from where he stood.</p>
        <p>"We wait," Devil said.</p>
        <p>I nodded. "Observe and listen."</p>
        <p>"I can do that." Milk said.</p>
        <p>"And after we've observed and waited?" Dog asked me.</p>
        <p>"Then we do what we do best."</p>
        <p>Devil's lips kicked up to the side as he said. "We scheme."</p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I</b> <b>WOULDN'T</b> lie and say my heart wasn't in my throat. It
          was. It was one thing to jump into danger when you're the one putting
          yourself into it, and it was another thing to be running—or in my
          current situation—walking towards the threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I maintained the look of indifference I had schooled my face into
          carrying this morning as we approached where I guess Elio Marino would
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo escorted us, the guy Elio called into the torture oven. He had
          arrived a few minutes ago at the—apartment—we were kept, with some men
          behind him. They all led us to another building in the compound, and
          now we were walking down a very long and weirdly clean hallway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men were everywhere, coming in and out of rooms you would never have
          guessed were rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just how big is this place?" Upper asked, breaking the silence around
          us. I couldn't help but feel proud at how calm he sounded like we
          weren't going to see the man who would be deciding our fate from this
          moment on—thanks to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's never-ending." Milk added, but her voice was small, and she
          wasn't doing anything to hide the uncertainty lining her brows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're almost there," Angelo answered, his head still bent, looking at
          his phone as he moved, almost like he knew the corners of this
          building by heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had passed through a large kind of hall to get here, and it was
          littered with soldiers walking around, all distracted with tasks they
          had been assigned to carry on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside me, Devil had one of those expressions that once had me raising
          my guard to the roof before I knew who he was. I could tell he was
          prepping his front, but I didn't understand why his whole form was
          tense. It seemed as if he was holding his breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe he was scared? But that would be crazy because putting Devil and
          that word together was impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to hold his hand, give it a squeeze to know that we were all
          here, we were all still breathing. But I held back because we didn't
          do that, and I would be a hypocrite because I was also in my head. So,
          I balled my hand up in a fist and steadied my breathing, calming
          myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I could register the faint sound of music, the men on each side
          of Angelo were pushing open double doors, and we entered a different
          space and time. It looked like we had somehow teleported into a casino
          in Las Vegas. The club was dim-lit, with neon lights dancing around,
          different poker tables, and seats filled by men who were hungry for
          money.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a live show on a distant stage. And another with poles
          holding naked strippers. There were also tables filled with stoners;
          all doped up in their own world. I was almost dizzy at the sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt warmth encase my free uninjured hand, and I tore my gaze from
          our surroundings and looked up at Devil. He squeezed my hand in his
          and bent to whisper in my ear. "You, okay?"
        </p>
        <p>I answered with a stiff nod. "Are you?"</p>
        <p>He answered with an equally stiff one.</p>
        <p>
          "It's like a fucking sin bin." Dog's voice reached my ear, but I
          didn't turn to see what other new thing he'd found. A lot was
          happening all at once, and it was easy to lose focus, so I let out a
          breath as Angelo led us up a roller-coaster staircase, which led to a
          more secluded area that gave way to yet another hallway.
        </p>
        <p>
          My anticipation grew, and my stomach knotted in nerves, but it was a
          feeling I could control, and Devil's hand on mine had me relaxing a
          bit; I could only hope he felt the same relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost as if he heard my thoughts, he squeezed my hand before letting
          go the moment Angelo stopped in front of a door, using a small key
          card to unlock it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We walked into a large spaced area that looked like a VIP apartment,
          an office, a boardroom, and a library. I noticed the men who followed
          Angelo had stopped outside as we walked in, the door closing behind
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the middle of the room was a long conference table with black
          leather chairs on each side. There was soft classical music in the
          air, smooth yet unnerving.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered to the head of the table, and sitting there was none
          other than Elio Marino, a book in his hand, the hardcover a plain
          black. He wore professional reading glasses as he read, and between
          his lips, a Cuban cigar rested, burning away slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind him, a huge black antique grandfather clock stood, drawing my
          attention back to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His black button-up had been rolled up to his elbows, outlining the
          tattoos on his left forearm, I didn't know why, but I found my eyes
          following the ink until it escaped under his rolled-up sleeve.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't tell what the drawings were, but they looked like dancing
          flames—I averted my gaze to the man sitting directly by the side of
          the head seat next to Elio. His eyes were on us the moment we stepped
          in, calculating and scanning us like he was cutting us down, limb from
          limb, to see if it was clinically safe to be in the same space with
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes shifted back to Elio, whose tattooed ring-cladded fingers
          moved to take the cigar from between his lips, blowing out the smoke,
          as he closed the book and dropped it on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man beside Elio cleared his throat, sitting up. "You can sit; the
          chairs don't bite." He said, sounding far from polite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil moved first, pulling out a seat, and we all followed, doing the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>I took the space between Devil and Milk.</p>
        <p>
          Angelo moved to stand beside Elio while Upper and Dog sat directly
          opposite us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk leaned into me as she whispered, motioning to the shelf. "So many
          books with the same black hard covers, it's creepy."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze moved to the shelves lining up the walls. The spines were all
          black, hard-covered spines, similar to the one he had been reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They are personalized versions of every popular book you can think
          of." Elio's accented voice rang out, and my gaze snapped to him as
          Milk stiffened beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He still wasn't looking up, and his reading glasses were still on his
          face. The moment he pressed the cigarette butt to the ashtray before
          him, he raised his gaze, and it locked with mine. My stomach jumped,
          but I schooled my features, not expressing any fear, as I kept my gaze
          on his.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shifted his attention to Milk, who still sat frozen beside me. "The
          color of your hair is pink, yes?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She was like stone now, nervousness pouring off her in waves; fuck—we
          really shouldn't have spent all through last night rehashing all that
          this man was capable of to be prepared for whatever might come our
          way. "Y-yes." She answered, her voice small.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog's eyes glazed in irritation at how weak she was making us look,
          and Upper just sat there stunned and probably waiting for the other
          shoe to drop. Devil was tenser than he had been before we got in here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio hummed. "Your hair is beautiful; what is the name?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Um... Milk?" she answered, confusion lacing her tone.</p>
        <p>
          Elio's head tilted to the other guy's side—<i
            >which I'm guessing was the Casmiro who knows best</i
          >—for confirmation about Milk's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Made up," Casmiro confirmed, making me frown. "You want the real
          one?"
        </p>
        <p>Milk's breathing quickened.</p>
        <p>
          "No. I like Milk better. Very...soft." Elio said, taking off his
          glasses and arranging them carefully beside the book before he looked
          at Milk again. "To kill your curiosity, Milk. My books are all black
          because I hate colors, and black is the absence of all colors."
        </p>
        <p>
          "White is also the absence of all colors," I said before I could catch
          my tongue, and his gaze, once again, fell on me, then to my arm as if
          to remind me what had happened the last time I contradicted something
          he said. But I didn't back down this time. "Green is also the absence
          of all colors; basically, all colors are the absence of all other
          colors, so how can you say you hate colors in general?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His right brow twitched. But he didn't break our eye contact, and I
          had no intention of breaking it. I noticed the music in the background
          beginning to ascend slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Asides from stealing money from people who can kill you, you fancy
          psychology too?"
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't a psychological question."</p>
        <p>"It sounded psychological to me."</p>
        <p>
          "You just didn't make any sense. I was only trying to understand you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's eyes widened from my peripheral vision, and Angelo shifted
          uncomfortably.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't make any sense," Elio stated as if tasting the word on his
          tongue like it was strange even to speak or hear them.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, you—"</p>
        <p>"Zahra." Devil's voice came out in a low hum of warning.</p>
        <p>
          "What? I was only pointing out what I thought was an error of thought.
          Isn't that allowed around here?" I raised a brow, looking around like
          we had an actual audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tension in the room grew with the ascending music as the silence
          stretched. I still didn't break our staring contest, and I was glad
          because I saw the shift in his eyes, the way they went from
          indifference to a hardness that would fool anyone into thinking it was
          a deeper level of boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, cut it out," Devil gritted out. I didn't listen. I won't look
          away. "Seriously, stop."
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt the fear I'd once harbored slipping away as control took over.
        </p>
        <p>
          I counted up to five in my head before looking away from him, and the
          moment I did; Upper spoke up. "I think Zahra's right."
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking hell," Devil whispered under his breath.</p>
        <p>
          "The color green is the absence of all colors, pink too, brown,
          yellow—all of the bloody colors, so like—black, they are also lone
          rangers."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isn't Black a shade?" Dog piqued up, and I smiled, leaning back on
          the chair, glad everything played out how my mind wanted it to. "I
          read once that black and white aren't colors but shades?"
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck is the difference, Dog?" Upper countered.</p>
        <p>"I'm here wondering how Dog got that information." Milk added.</p>
        <p>
          Dog shrugged. "Found some textbooks in a dumpster once; one was about
          all the fucking colors; I don't even know why I read that shit; I
          don't know why it stuck too."
        </p>
        <p>"We're all gonna die," Devil muttered again. </p>
        <p>
          "Black and White are augmented colors. Not like the other colors;
          they're like the parents of all colors." Milk said, nodding as if she
          was only just understanding what she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Colors don't have parents, Milk. You're such an airhead." Upper said
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're the airhead if you don't understand simple metaphors, Upper."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oi, I know bloody metaphors all right; I went to school, unlike you
          and these other shitheads." <i>Shit heads meaning us. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shut the fuck up, Upper. When the fuck did you have the time to go to
          school?" Dog asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're all dead." Devil rubbed both his eyes in defeat as he shook his
          head, the music in the background ascending even further.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He probably climbed up school roofs and hid in their ventilators just
          to attend classes." Milk said with a smart-ass evil smile curling by
          the side of her lips as she served him that dig.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper's jaw clenched. "Fine, you fuckers, I climbed up a few
          ventilators, so bloody what? I'm still fucking educated, better than
          the lots of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I read actual books from the trash and still remembered deets from
          it, fuck—If I had gone to school, I would have been one smart
          motherfucker." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>"You're pretty good with numbers." I mused.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm a fucking genius with numbers." He corrected me, and the room
          went silent again, followed by the music in the background descending.
        </p>
        <p>I sat up, finally looking back at Elio, Casmiro, and Angelo.</p>
        <p>
          Elio still had a look of indifference on his face, but his gaze was
          sweeping through our little group with wonder. Casmiro's jaw was
          hanging, and Angelo just stood there, wide-eyed, with amusement
          dancing within them and a slight smile curling at his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat. "There you have it, we're STREET," then I let my
          taunting stare settle on Elio as I said. "It is only right to prepare
          your family for what awaits you, as you've decided to consider my
          request."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was silent for a few minutes before he sat up, leaned in, and
          placed both elbows on the table before settling his hand beneath his
          chin. "What makes you think I've considered it?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm still breathing," I answered without blinking.</p>
        <p>"And I'm beginning to think Casmiro knows best after all."</p>
        <p>
          At the mention of his name, he cleared his throat. "I was wrong. I
          think they're perfect." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just because that one climbed up a ventilator like a fucking rat?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil sighed. "I think what Casmiro is trying to say is; because Upper
          climbed up a ventilator for years and got a full education without
          being <i>seen</i>." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze snapped toward Devil's direction, and I saw that shift in
          his eyes again; the look was an obvious dare, almost as if he was
          daring Devil to speak again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could swear I saw Devil roll his eyes as he relaxed back on his
          chair, crossing his arm against his chest, looking straight ahead, his
          jaw locked.
        </p>
        <p><i>What the fuck was that?</i></p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze rested on me. "Your introduction was comical but not
          appreciated."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I beg to differ; if we're going to work together, you should know
          what you're dealing with."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro scoffed. "Or maybe you have forgotten how you got here. You
          work <i>for</i> us now, not <i>with</i> us. There is a big
          difference."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, but just because we work <i>for</i> you doesn't mean we
          change how we work. Or the way we communicate with each other, getting
          engrossed in a stupid argument when our lives are in danger, is how we
          work well together."
        </p>
        <p>"It's the only way we can function." Dog added.</p>
        <p>"Chaos is STREET." Upper grinned.</p>
        <p>"And it's kind of fun." Milk finalized.</p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze settled on each of us—except Devil—before he took his
          hands away from his chin, took a new cigar from the table, placed it
          between his lips, flicked on the lighter he dug out from his pocket,
          and then lit the cigar. I watched him take a long drag before letting
          it out slowly, tormentingly, before he finally spoke. "Why don't we
          test that theory." <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I SHOULD</b> have killed the short one when I had the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          While being annoyingly audacious, she constantly placed her foot in
          her mouth. She spoke without thinking and, like Casmiro, could look me
          in the eye without fear. 
        </p>
        <p>She was going to be a problem.</p>
        <p>
          I allowed the cigar warm its way around my body, removing my gaze from
          her to take them all in individually. I could tell they had a
          tight-knit relationship, not built on trust but on situations they
          could all relate to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was admirable, but a sick part of me wondered what it would take to
          break them up—that same sick part of me wanted to see it happen too.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze moved to Devil, and my stomach curled. Was this a feeling of
          irritation—or anger—or was I finally reacting negatively to the
          countless cigars I had taken in today?
        </p>
        <p>
          I secretly hoped it was the last one. I couldn't afford any slip-ups
          now—not when I was almost there, almost at the finish line.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Should I proceed?" Casmiro asked from beside me, and I nodded once,
          my gaze shifting to the short one again when I caught movement from
          her end. Her face was pulled up in a tight frown, posture rigid as
          Casmiro stood up to retrieve whatever documents he had gathered for
          their first task.
        </p>
        <p>
          I zoned out voluntarily—needing some time alone in my head to study
          these people. Starting from the one who claimed to speak for the...do
          I even call them a group or band of thieves? Fuck it...starting from
          their so-called leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra Faizan, a twenty-four-year-old woman who looked like she had
          only just crossed sixteen. If I didn't entirely trust the info given
          by my people, I would have guessed she was unaware of her own age. Her
          face was small and round, curly dark brown hair cut perfectly below
          her jaw.
        </p>
        <p>I hated it.</p>
        <p>
          My mother loved her hair and was equally obsessed with my sister's
          hair. The only time I'd ever seen her smile was when she brushed her
          hair and my sister's. Sometimes, she would try to take the brush to my
          hair, but a look from my father would have her recoiling back, and
          then when I was unfortunately alone with him, he'd tell me affection
          was useless if it wasn't put into something like getting the actual
          job done.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why the women I fucked had a specific look to them. Long
          hair... could be any color, but it had to be long and healthy like
          Milk's. I admired the color of her hair, the length, and the
          healthiness of each strand; it was compelling. Not in a way that would
          make me want to fuck her, but in a way that I admired.
        </p>
        <p>
          The short one's hair was unkempt, showed signs of little care, and
          irritated me.
        </p>
        <p>I tilted my head, looking closely.</p>
        <p>
          Now that I think about it, it was impossible to imagine her with long
          hair; it wouldn't suit those sharp eyes and small nose above her small
          pouty li—her gaze caught mine, and her frown deepened, upper lip
          turning up in an irritated snare as she raised a brow as if to ask why
          I was staring.
        </p>
        <p>Fascinating.</p>
        <p>
          The fear I saw the other day was gone—It made me question if that was
          even fear or defeat. Over the years in this business, I'd learned that
          there was an extensive line between those two feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last time I felt fear, it never lasted long before defeat came in
          with an ease that changed something significant in me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Marino?" That was Angelo's voice, and I caught myself blinking out of
          my head before looking away from Zahra and up to Angelo, who wore a
          cautious look on his face while Casmiro stared with slight concern.
        </p>
        <p>"What," I asked them, discarding the cigar.</p>
        <p>"We've been asking a question," Casmiro answered.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, keeping my attention on them, but they said nothing,
          allowing the silence spread even further.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my brows, blinking pointedly. "Do I have to spell out that
          you now have my attention, or is there something on my face."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh." Angelo cleared his throat. "You were supposed to update me on
          Dion Juan Pablo's next visit to Palazzo Blu, but I never heard—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Two weeks from this one. It should give the little one's shoulder
          time to heal so it wouldn't raise suspicions."
        </p>
        <p>
          From the corner of my eye, I saw her raise her hand like she wanted to
          ask a question. "The name's Zahra, in case you've forgotten. Old age
          can be a bitch."
        </p>
        <p>I paused.</p>
        <p>
          The feeling I got whenever Casmiro would eat and leave his dirty dish
          in the same spot curled in my stomach again but in double folds this
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This," I slowly turned my gaze from Casmiro and Angelo to look back
          at her taunting gaze. "This is why I shot you; you do not know when to
          shut up. Don't make me put the unpleasant thoughts running through my
          head into reality."
        </p>
        <p>
          She dropped her hand. "Maybe when you start addressing me by my name,
          you wouldn't have to harbor unpleasant thoughts, or kill me, which
          would easily result in you killing us all, and then who would help you
          with whatever you need to get from Dion Juan Pablo, who, mind you,
          isn't going to be at Palazzo Blu, but at Club Eden, because he
          probably knows people like you would want to pay him a little visit,
          hence why everyone who isn't us, would think he would be at Palazzo
          Blu."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hold on; you know Dion Juan Pablo?" Casmiro asked, unable to hide the
          shock in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uh..." the Upper one spoke up. "He's kind of like a public figure?
          You lots know what Instagram is, right? He posts shit about his life
          on there. We also happen to know through Instagram that he is gunning
          for control over state affairs in Turin, and of course, we know it's
          for the Pablo's, and they'll most likely handle private affairs; the
          people don't know that though, hence why there's a massive support
          from them because he markets himself as a people person."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And <i>people</i> love people who make it seem like people would
          never grow old if they can help it," Dog said
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dion is also a very cunning and foolish man, getting high on his own
          drug supply," Devil said. "...while boning for the power at the high
          seats, just like Marino is. And we know how difficult it is to breach
          his walls."
        </p>
        <p>"For your people, not for us." Zahra completed.</p>
        <p>
          Then there was silence, safe for the ticking of the grandfather clock
          behind me, as we all watched each other until—
        </p>
        <p>"And we killed his dog."</p>
        <p>"Oh, my fucking God, Milk," Dog</p>
        <p>"You just had to contribute," Zahra.</p>
        <p>"Why would you say that?" Upper</p>
        <p>"Fucking hell, Milk." Devil</p>
        <p>They all spoke in sync, causing a noise.</p>
        <p>
          "What!" Milk whined out in defense. "I thought we were all saying
          stuff we knew about Dion."
        </p>
        <p>Zahra groaned. "Not that kinda stuff."</p>
        <p>
          "You killed his dog?" Angelo asked in that tone he used when he was
          amused.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was an honest mistake, I sincerely thought it was dog food, and
          the big guy was giving me the
          <i>I am hungry eyes. Please feed me, kind lady; what</i> the hell was
          I to do, leave it to starve?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes." They all chorused at the same time.</p>
        <p>"That would have been cruel."</p>
        <p>"And accidentally killing it, wasn't?"</p>
        <p>"At least I tried to feed it; what did you do, Upper?"</p>
        <p>
          Upper gasped. "He sniffed the bloody cocaine. How was I supposed to
          know dogs love sniffing things."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can ask the one beside you," Devil pointed to Dog, who allowed a
          small unfeeling smile onto his lips before raising his middle finger
          at Devil, who answered with an appreciative nod.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk scoffed. "Maybe the thingy in the can wasn't what killed it; the
          cocaine probably did, so technically, Upper and I murdered Dion's dog.
          Don't blame me because I'm the only girl in the group."
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra backed up in shock, shooting Milk a look of disbelief before
          Milk corrected herself by saying, "Yeah, and Zahra too."
        </p>
        <p>Devil bit back a laugh which earned him a glare from Zahra.</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, so what I'm getting from this is that you all have seen Dion
          and have some kind of personal relationship with him?" Casmiro asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No man," Dog answered this time. "We have seen Dion, yes... but he's
          never seen us; no one ever sees us."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head at this <i>group</i>. "But, somehow, you managed to
          enter his home and murder his dog," I stated, very confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We just went there for free food and the fucking amazing bathtub he
          announced on his socials, and well—to live a make-believe rich ass
          lifestyle, we stayed for just two hours... wasn't anything personal,"
          Dog answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh shit, they're serious; they actually killed the dog; Dion held a
          funeral for it," Angelo said, his eyes glued to whatever article he
          read on his phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took in a breath and then let it out. "I'm afraid your first mission
          for me would require some of you letting Dion see you. How are you
          certain Dion would be at Club Eden?"
        </p>
        <p>"We are," Devil answered.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, thoughts filtering through my head before finally letting
          out the less obnoxious one. "Then that's where he's stationing for his
          stay this time. In politics, there's what I call extreme pettiness.
          You should be petty if you want to take the bag and the title. Dion is
          foolish, probably the only man with power who surrounds himself with
          incompetent soldiers because he is ignorant."
        </p>
        <p>"That I can agree on." Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "Our people would need direct intel on him and the entire Pablo
          syndicate," Angelo said. "We want to see and hear everything, from
          their business meetings to past and present associations and
          collaborations, legal and illegal; everything. We need a chain, and we
          need them not to notice until we are done with them. This means an
          invisible non-existing server they would never be able to trace back
          to Marino. Can your team arrange that?" Angelo asked.
        </p>
        <p>"It's possible," Upper said, looking at Dog. "Right?"</p>
        <p>
          Dog's gaze settled on Zahra, and I looked back in her direction to
          find her deep in thought before she looked up. "It is possible. But
          our method is to <i>not</i> be seen. I'm finding it hard to understand
          what you meant by Dion seeing some of us?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My tongue poked at the inside of my cheek as I thought about her
          question and the answer to give. When I found it, I sat up. "Dion will
          see you, but he doesn't need to know whom he sees. He's only going to
          see what we want him to. This case is delicate; we must sway Dion's
          attention from his conscious to deal with his subconscious. I would
          assume your team is well-versed in creating narratives."
        </p>
        <p>"We are." Milk said. "In fact, I have an idea." She grinned.</p>
        <p>
          "Good." I pointedly dangled my index finger at her. "That is what I
          like to hear, hm? Progress, proactive thinking, it keeps people
          alive."
        </p>
        <p>Zahra's frown was back. "What the fuck is that—"</p>
        <p>
          "So," Devil sat up, blocking Zahra from my view, eyes locking with
          mine without blinking. "You want to get into Pablo's affairs; that can
          be arranged. We'll relay the information to Angelo when we've devised
          a plan. But the sooner we plan, the sooner we are assured we can pull
          it off without mistakes. Permission to leave?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit my tongue hard, only drawing back when I tasted blood.
          "Permission granted," I said, and he began to stand before I added,
          "For everyone but you."
        </p>
        <p>
          He winced, closing his eyes and letting out a sharp breath before
          sitting back down and turning to a confused Zahra and an even more
          confused crew. "It's okay, guys; I'll catch up."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's going on?" Zahra whispered to him, the concern in her voice
          reflecting on her face.
        </p>
        <p>"It's okay, go. I'll catch up."</p>
        <p>She glanced at me, the frown still on her face.</p>
        <p>
          "Z, I'll explain later—just for now, leave; I promise I'll come back
          alive."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't make promises you can't keep," I said, not hiding the fact that
          I was listening in, eying the two of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra's scowl was permanent as she got up, signaling to the others
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched them all file out before looking over at Casmiro and Angelo,
          raising a brow of inquiry at them.
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro frowned. "Us too?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, Casmiro."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes shifted between Devil and me before he asked. "Is everything
          good?"
        </p>
        <p>"Everything is perfect," I answered.</p>
        <p>
          "Okay," Casmiro said, nodding to Angelo as they both walked to the
          door before Casmiro turned back to me. "Hey if he tries—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "If he tries to stab me in the neck, I'll cry for help; now leave." My
          knee was bouncing rapidly underneath the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rolling his eyes, he and Angelo walked out, closing the door behind
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed a minute of silence before I decided to speak up. "This
          was—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The door bust open, revealing Dog breathing like he had just raced
          back. "Fuck—sorry—I forgot to ask Devil something important." He let
          out a breath. "Why the fuck is that hallway so damn long?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is it?" Devil asked, concern in his voice as Dog came closer.
        </p>
        <p>"Uh—the sandwich, the one you didn't finish, can I—"</p>
        <p>"Not on your fucking life."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned in confusion. Was this code for something? Or were they
          really talking about sandwiches?
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking chill. It's probably cold now—"</p>
        <p>
          "It's for later, you fucking idiot; I didn't ask you to choke yours
          down your damn throat because you're never satisfied with food."
        </p>
        <p>"So, I ran all the way here for nothing? Come on, Devil."</p>
        <p>
          "If I get back, and my damn sandwich is missing, I'm gonna make you
          pay."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog sighed. "Whatever," his gaze met mine. "Sorry for the
          interruption, but do me a favor by making him sweat, whatever it is
          you're gonna fucking do to him—when I mean sweat, I don't mean that
          oven shit you did to Zahra I—"
        </p>
        <p>"Dog, just go," Devil said with a sigh.</p>
        <p>
          "Fine," he backed up. "See you—at—yeah, whatever." And then he was out
          the door, slamming it shut behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, letting out a long-controlled breath before
          speaking. "What the fuck have you gotten yourself into, Elia."<br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>I found out my father was having an affair when I was eight.</p>
        <p>
          And when I was nine, I saw my half-brother for the first time. Father
          had named him Elia; he had been so tiny, fragile, and innocent. I used
          to be angry that my father had forgotten his vow to my mother. I knew
          he lacked common morals, but I'd always respected that even though he
          didn't show it, he loved my mother—well, until the day I saw him
          kissing a dark-haired woman in his car.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father told me that no matter what I did, I couldn't tell my
          mother, my sister, or my brother that we had another blood relative,
          and I did keep quiet. Although I felt guilty whenever my father would
          take me to see Elia, I felt guilty that my family didn't get to meet
          him to see how precious he was. I felt guilty for denying Elia the
          opportunity to see them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I vowed that one day, one day I would let my father get out of my
          head, and I would make sure everyone knew about Elia; I swore that I'd
          give Elia a chance to know my family; but that was until my father
          decided he didn't want anything to do with Elia nor his mother after
          he had found out Elia's mother let a delicate information slip, and
          the next solution he could come up with was to get rid of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was fifteen, and Elia was just six when we watched my father and his
          mother lash each other with words, a scenario that led to a bullet
          right between her eyes. It took me a good two minutes to remember Elia
          wasn't supposed to see that, but before I could shield his eyes from
          his mother's lifeless body, he'd seen it all. But I still held him,
          and my grip tightened when my father turned his furious and sick gaze
          to us, pointing the gun in Elia's direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Step away, Elio." My father had said, his voice molded with vengeance
          and determination. "I don't want you stained with the sinner's blood."
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember swallowing. I remember how the gun resting at the back of
          my pants burned at my skin. I wanted to shoot him—to kill my
          father—the urge was strong, but I knew I couldn't do it. I'd never
          killed anyone; I didn't have the guts to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Move, Elio." He said with an impatience that had me blurting out the
          first word I could think of.
        </p>
        <p>"I'll do it."</p>
        <p>
          My father had raised his brow in confusion and question. "Repeat
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gulped down, my stare firm and determined. "I will kill him myself.
          No one sells out Marino and lives. The sinner doesn't exist if your
          bullet ends up in them."
        </p>
        <p>
          My father lowered his gun and slowly walked over to me, placing his
          hand on my shoulder; I was baffled at how I could compose myself
          without jumping out of my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked me in the eye as he said. "I renounce Elia as my flesh and
          blood. When you kill him, you kill the last of his bloodline."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gave a single firm nod. "I am proud of you, Elio. Make sure I see
          the proof."
        </p>
        <p>"I will."</p>
        <p>
          "Good, I'll handle the problem his cunt of a mother caused. Make sure
          the child dies tonight."
        </p>
        <p>"I will, sir."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, patted my shoulder, and looked at Elia in disgust. His gaze
          was hard enough that I visibly flinched, and then he was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had released a breath, my ears ringing in alarm because I knew I
          wouldn't do it—but I was still going to make my first kill today.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I did it, after I had found someone who would take the place of
          my little brother, after I had puked my guts out when the body dropped
          lifelessly on the ground, I knew who I was—I was a sinner, and I
          didn't deserve to live. Then again, my father made me do it;
          therefore, He'd be the last person I kill. <br /><br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good to see you too, Elio." Devil's voice brought me out of my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes again and finally looked at him. I'd kept tabs on
          him, even though he didn't know, and while I'd refrained from reaching
          out due to avoiding a compromise in my goals, I still felt that
          hollowed sinking feeling in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unable to bear the sight of him, I shot to my feet, stepping away from
          the table, my hand going to rub my head. "How long—how long have you
          been in Italy?" I asked him, my voice leveled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Does it matter? I'm here now." his voice was unconcerned, unbothered,
          as I heard his chair shift, signaling that he was getting up from his.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned sharply to find him standing there, no expression on his
          face, with both hands shoved into his pockets.
        </p>
        <p>"Answer the fucking question, Elia."</p>
        <p>"I go by Devil now." he snapped back.</p>
        <p>
          I felt that coil in my stomach again, and if I didn't know better, I'd
          have pegged the feeling as anger. Hell, I'll peg it as anger because I
          needed a name to express how I felt.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, <i>Devil</i>. How long have you <i>been</i> in Italy?"</p>
        <p>He squared his jaw. "Thirteen years."</p>
        <p>
          "Thirteen—" I deflated, looking at him with disbelief. "<i
            >Thirteen</i
          >
          years, Elia? How do I not know this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He shrugged. "According to your intel, I'm probably on my way from
          work in Los Angeles. You're not the only smart person in the room,
          Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "You think this is smart?" I walked sharply over to
          him, stopping until I stood right before him. He stood taller, fear
          flashing in his eyes as he inched backward. It was a small flinch, but
          I felt the effect of it slam down my chest. "You think I will hurt
          you?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know what to think. I don't know you."</p>
        <p>"Elia-"</p>
        <p>"It's Devil." He gritted out.</p>
        <p>
          "<i>Devil</i>...you are not supposed to be here. Los Angeles was
          <i>perfect</i> for you. Why would you want to be here? You could have
          it all, a normal life, sound mind, a clear record—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't have any records; I'm basically a nobody. You made sure of
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "To protect you, El—Devil. I did it all to protect you from this. And
          you—a common thief? Stealing from me? <b><i>Tu Hermano?  </i></b>I
          would give you whatever it was in a heartbeat if you wanted anything.
          Why did you have to pull up this <i>so-called </i>gang?To rob from me,
          your family?" <i>Your brother?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are not my family. As far as I'm concerned, that so-called
          <i>gang</i> is my family. They would never abandon or erase me to make
          things more convenient for them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hissed. "None of this will last, Devil. What you see today will be
          nothing but dust beneath your feet tomorrow. I never abandoned you,
          ok? I protected you from me, from this, from my father. You're my only
          flesh and blood; I do not desire for you to walk the path I have
          walked, Devil. You deserve all that is good, all that is clean and
          pure. A clean life. Not <i>this</i>." I shook my head in indignation.
          "I never wanted this for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't get to <i>want</i> things for me, Elio. I'm not some dumb
          kid anymore. The last time I saw you physically, I was ten fucking
          years old. You were my brother, the only person I knew, the only
          person I loved, my only family—and all I asked—all I asked was for you
          not to let me go, and you fucking promised me you wouldn't send me
          away. You gave me your word. And then I slept and woke up in Los
          Angeles—"
        </p>
        <p>"Devil—"</p>
        <p>
          "You don't get to fucking talk about family when you abandoned me,
          Elio. When you won't even tell anyone that I am your blood. When
          you're ashamed of me." He laughed humorlessly, shaking his head. "I
          used to make excuses for you, you know? I used to think maybe he did
          it because he was scared of his father; maybe he did it because my
          life would have been in danger. But then I heard the news—about the
          fire—Lorenzo and Mariana."
        </p>
        <p>
          Pain slapped me unexpectedly because I knew what he would say next.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How you fucking burnt them alive...and stabbed the mother you claimed
          to love. Then I realized maybe you are just like him—<i>worse</i> than
          him—and then I beat myself up every day for believing what could have
          been lies because the person I knew would never do anything like that.
          But then again, he would also never break his promise to me, but he
          did." 
        </p>
        <p>After he said that, the silence stretched between us.</p>
        <p>
          It was a long, tension-filled one, but after a while, I nodded while
          taking steps away from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I turned, I stretched my neck muscles from left to right,
          regaining my composure and allowing a calm settle within me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I welcomed the familiar calmness with a bold embrace even though its
          outcome had never yielded any good result.
        </p>
        <p>
          I proceeded to go and pour myself a drink and then leaned an elbow on
          the table, drink in hand, as I watched him.
        </p>
        <p>"You're angry."</p>
        <p>"No shit, fucking sherlock."</p>
        <p>I nodded again. "What do you want me to do about it?"</p>
        <p>He frowned. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You want me to apologize for abandoning you, hm? You want me to hug
          you and tell you how much you mean to me? To beg you to go back to Los
          Angeles, live your best life and stay away from crime?"
        </p>
        <p>He didn't respond, but his eyes flared.</p>
        <p>
          "By all means, <i>Devil</i>. Carry on with your thieving addiction and
          the little minions you consider family. But remember that I own you
          now—not as a brother—but as a man who stole from my family. You want
          to separate yourself from me, tell me you don't know me—fine, I have
          no problem with that because, honestly, it gives me one less thing to
          worry about."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm good with that." He bit out.</p>
        <p>
          Taking a sip from my glass, I began walking to him again, this time
          getting in his face. He didn't flinch.
        </p>
        <p>"I am glad you are good with it. Do you know why?"</p>
        <p>His nostrils flare. "Why."</p>
        <p>
          "Because I wouldn't have to think of you before I put a bullet in the
          head of one of your <i>fucking</i> family—when I kill them right in
          front of your eyes, slowly—very fucking slowly because I would desire
          for you to hear them scream while their lives slip away from their
          eyes, and then after I've done that," I inched closer to him,
          directing my mouth to his ear. "I'll point a gun to your fucking head
          and do what I should have done years ago. I'm sure your cunt of a
          mother would appreciate it."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I was shoved so hard that the glass fell from my hand,
          shattering to the ground, the groan of anger from Devil was the only
          warning I got before he pounced on me, and we both toppled to the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          His grip on my shirt was not too hard that I couldn't push him off,
          but hard enough to know that this was precisely what he needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, when his fists connected with my face, I let it. I let him hit me
          repeatedly, and when he yelled, 'fight back!' I seized to protect
          myself from him; I allowed him to damage the little he could; I let
          him pour out his anger because I needed him to—only then would he be
          able to see reason.
        </p>
        <p>So, I let him take what he wanted from me.</p>
        <p>
          Only a few seconds later did the sound of the door busting open reach
          my ears, and then Devil was being hurled from above me.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a dozen men were inside our space; Casmiro raised his gun to
          Devil's head, a second away from shooting.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't you fucking dare!" my voice boomed around the space, gaining
          confused looks from everyone around me except Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got to my feet like a madman; my heart was racing so hard in my
          chest that I felt my whole body vibrate with anger and—and fear.
          Suddenly I was fifteen years old again, and there was a gun pointed at
          Elia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly, I held his wrist, pulling him behind me so I stood right
          before Casmiro's gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immediately, Casmiro lowered his gun, and so did the other men around
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Anyone who touches a hair on his head will not live to see the second
          after. That's a fucking promise."
        </p>
        <p>
          My breathing was harsh, and the panic inside me was uncurling.
          Fifteen-year-old Elio was back in my body, and the image of my father
          was as clear as day in my head, his gun—Elia's small frame—the tangy
          smell of blood coming from his dead mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil roughly shrugged his hand away from my hold and bolted from the
          office without a second glance our way, and I tried to calm my
          breathing—I tried to count in my head like I used to do all those
          years—but I suddenly forgot how to count, I forgot numbers—I forgot
          everything. My name, where I am, who I am—everything—my brain was
          completely empty.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio, what the fuck just happened? How can you let him go—"</p>
        <p>"Out." My voice was clipped, short, strange, and unfamiliar.</p>
        <p>"What—"</p>
        <p>"Get the fuck out—everyone, get the fuck out. Now."</p>
        <p>
          The person who had spoken gave an angry muffled complaint before I
          heard footsteps retreating, followed by the sound of the door closing
          and then...silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sank to my knees, unable to stand any longer. My hands shook
          fervently, and my breathing was drawing up short.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my eyes together, willing myself to remember how to count
          again—but I couldn't—I felt like a stranger in my own body, and I
          craved a sense of self-familiarity than I craved air at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I opened my eyes, it came in contact with the first familiar
          thing my brain could register.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed in relief as I dragged my body toward a corner of the office
          and picked up the triangle-shaped shard of glass.<br /><br /><br />

          <b>"IT'S ALMOST</b> as if they stocked this place up because they knew
          I would stay here," Dog said, bringing out the wrapped meat from the
          freezer as Milk helped slice out the vegetables while Upper and I
          sorted out new intel about Dion Juan Pablo that might aid our mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog dropped the meat on the table, raising it a little and slapping
          the bottom of the wrap sexually, and then he met my gaze with a silly
          wink.
        </p>
        <p>"You're gross," I told him.</p>
        <p>
          "You love it." he grinned, finally letting the meat go and rubbing his
          palms together as he proceeded to carry on with his cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's changed three bodyguards in the last two months," Upper said,
          adjusting his glasses as he clicked open another file on the laptop's
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>I proceeded to jot down that information.</p>
        <p>
          Our belongings had been brought to us the day before, not everything,
          but enough. I missed our studio apartment; things were more familiar
          there, even though it had been smaller and less spacious.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought the Marino's were business associates with the Pablo's. I'm
          unclear why the Marino's would want to breach personal intel on them."
          Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A betrayal? We can't put it past these families. There is no such
          thing as trust amongst them." Milk answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "On a scale of one to ten, what are our chances of actually pulling
          this off?" Dog asked.
        </p>
        <p>"A ten. It's not the hardest job we've ever done." I said.</p>
        <p>"But it's the only job where we'd be seen for the first time."</p>
        <p>"Elio didn't say we couldn't go with a disguise?" Milk voiced.</p>
        <p>
          "Oooou," Dog bumped Milk's shoulder. "So, he's <i>Elio</i> now, huh."
        </p>
        <p>Milk blinked innocently at him. "What do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "You wanna fucking stand here and tell me you didn't see him full-on
          checking you out? Please."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's no surprise. Milk's a man magnet." Upper said, his attention
          still entirely on his laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk scoffed. "The only man who I've ever been attracted to isn't
          attracted to my whole gender." She pointedly shot a look at Upper, who
          was already chuckling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Apologies, my fair lady, but I like dick." Upper responded, looking
          up from the laptop, with a double take toward the house's entrance.
          His brows drew down in a concerned frown, and I followed his gaze to
          find Devil walking towards us. His stance was firm, features tight,
          frown hard, and knuckles...a little bruised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence fell upon us as he walked behind, past Upper and me, and then
          around the kitchen counter to the fridge. Wordlessly. He opened it,
          grabbed a beer bottle, uncapped it with his teeth, and took a big gulp
          out of it before his frantic eyes searched the dining table until they
          zeroed in on the covered plate where his sandwich lay beneath. He
          uncovered it and picked up his sandwich, shoving it into his mouth as
          he walked out of the kitchen without acknowledging any of us.
        </p>
        <p>"Something's up." Milk's voice came out in a whisper.</p>
        <p>"He looks angry." Dog pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          "Didn't he stay back to talk to Elio? Does anyone know what that was
          about?" Upper asked, gaze shifting between Milk, Dog, and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, getting off the stool the moment Upper did. "I'll
          check," we said simultaneously, and I paused, frowning in confusion at
          him.
        </p>
        <p>Milk and Dog also stared at him with the same expression.</p>
        <p>
          Upper blinked at us before sitting back down, clearing his throat, and
          adjusting his glasses. "I was—I was only curious. You know me.
          Sticking my nose in everybody's bloody business is my forte."
        </p>
        <p>"No, it's not." Milk called him out.</p>
        <p>
          He blinked, unable to mask his fluster. "Well—I'm making it my forte
          now." he looked around the kitchen before his eyes settled on Milk.
          "Why...are you...wearing that pink shirt? Why didn't you wear another
          color? See, that's me being in your business—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just stop, dude." Dog said with a chuckle to make light of the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll go check on him," I said, ignoring Upper and
          his—<i>weird</i>—weirdness as I made my way to the room he shared with
          Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door was wide open, and he was sitting at the edge of his bed,
          head downcast, with the beer in his hand, settled on a tight grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knocked gently, and he raised his head, haunted eyes locking with
          mine. "I don't wanna talk."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "It's unfair to tell me that when you look like you want to
          talk, Devil."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away, his gaze settling on the wall as if he was trying to
          burn a hole through it.
        </p>
        <p>I walked into the room cautiously, sitting beside him.</p>
        <p>
          I wasn't the best at this, I'd never once strived to be the best at
          talking down any of them or offering my shoulder or words of support,
          but for the first time in forever, I wanted to be that person who knew
          just what to say.
        </p>
        <p>I let out a shaky breath. "What happened?"</p>
        <p>"Can't talk about it," he answered, an edge to his voice.</p>
        <p>
          I shifted slightly. "Did he...make another bargain? Threaten us? If
          it's about—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not about you or STREET. Just forget it; I can't talk about it,
          Z."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was confused. What could they have talked about? What could Elio
          have said to Devil to get him in this mood? Devil was always laid
          back; his features never outrightly indicated that he was hurt or
          confused about something. He was either angry or happy, or too
          focused. This was new...the most guarded I'd ever seen him.
        </p>
        <p>Could it be...</p>
        <p>
          "Wait—did he tell you shit about who you are? Because in that meeting,
          it seemed like they knew us—like they dug deep into our background and
          probably knew stuff we don't even know about ourselves. Is that what
          this is about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes, letting out a slow, steady breath, almost like he
          was trying to calm himself. "No, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then what the hell happened? Why do you look like you're stopping
          yourself from punching something?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Drop it, Z. I said I didn't want to talk about it." his voice was
          heavy yet sharp.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "You can't expect me to just ignore—"</p>
        <p>
          He turned sharply to me. "You know, just because we fuck from time to
          time doesn't mean you get to push when I <i>clearly</i> don't want to
          talk about something."
        </p>
        <p>
          I backed up at the bite in his voice, ignoring how his words poked the
          wrong nerve, before speaking again. "I care, Devil; <i>that's</i> why
          I'm here."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then don't fucking care. I didn't ask for it; we don't have that kind
          of relationship, so what the fuck is this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze searched mine, silently pleading for me to stop trying to get
          through to him, to turn around like I usually do. To pretend that I
          cared but won't do anything about it because it would complicate
          things.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay," I said softly, getting to my feet.</p>
        <p>His Jaw clenched as he watched me with glassy eyes.</p>
        <p>
          I brushed my hair away from my face. "When you feel better, join us
          for dinner; we're overlooking some details about Dion. Um...just—feel
          better because we need your head in the game."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have stayed, but—he was right. We didn't share that kind of
          relationship. Apparently, it ended with, "Are you all right." And
          "Fine." When it came to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he didn't respond, I moved for the door, but his hand gripped my
          wrist, stopping me before I could walk past him. I turned to see him
          drop the beer bottle on the ground before pulling me to his lap,
          pushing my hair from my face. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to come
          out like that. I just—"
        </p>
        <p>"I know—"</p>
        <p>
          "No—it's not as if I don't want to talk about it...I do; I really
          fucking want to tell you everything—to tell someone—it's just—he won't
          let me. I'm not allowed to; I've never been allowed to."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was even more confused but knew not to push it, so I just nodded and
          asked, "Is this thing—bad? Like, does it put you in any sort of
          danger?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No." then he chuckled sadly before releasing a
          sigh. "I think it's the only reason we are still breathing."
        </p>
        <p>"Is it...personal?"</p>
        <p>He squared his jaw before nodding.</p>
        <p>
          "Does it answer why you somehow know every nook and cranny of this
          whole compound?"
        </p>
        <p>He hesitated before nodding again.</p>
        <p>"Did you punch him?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Several times, yes."</p>
        <p>
          I smiled sadly at him, wrapping my good arm around him in a hug.
          "Good," I whispered, and he held me tighter, and I buried my head in
          the crook of his neck, breathing him in.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't have to tell me, but it was pretty obvious—either they were
          very close friends or...they were family.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was only one way to confirm this, and it made me look forward to
          when it was dark again.
        </p>
        <p>"This won't...complicate things, would it? between us?" He asked.</p>
        <p>
          I chuckled, raising my head to meet his gaze, my knuckle coming to
          graze his cheek. "I don't know why we're so scared of that. I mean, I
          care about you, and you care about me. This crew, we care about each
          other, and though we have other stuff going on, it shouldn't stop us
          from showing support when we're down."
        </p>
        <p>He nodded.</p>
        <p>
          I brushed his hair back. "Before we started this, we were trying to be
          friends, and then when we started, we were best friends." I released a
          breath. "I know how things like this work, how feelings could get
          mixed up, how we could ruin our friendship...but I just don't see it
          happening with us, do you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips curled in a smile. "No. You're my best friend, Zahra. I don't
          want to lose this too. Maybe that's why I don't want to blur the line.
          I need you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned in to press a kiss on his cheek. "I'm here; I'll always be
          here for you. I might not know the right thing to say, but I can
          listen, and I can hold you, and you can cry if that's what you want;
          I'd never tell anyone."
        </p>
        <p>"But then you'd have something to hold against me."</p>
        <p>
          I laughed, shaking my head. "I have to get you in line one way or
          another, Devil."
        </p>
        <p>
          His forehead rested on mine as he closed his eyes, breathed, and
          swallowed. "You already have me in line."
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Escaping the soldiers assigned to watch our building was the easy
          part. The hardest part was climbing up the stairs to the roof, where I
          had spotted Elio from Upper's illegal access to the Marino security
          cameras. Because whom the hell in their right mind would build a place
          as high as this, without an elevator or even a fucking stair railing
          for people who have fucking anxiety!
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment I passed through the roof door, I let out a breath of
          relief, willing my heart to return to its normal rhythm as my eyes
          traveled the space between where I stood and where Elio leaned against
          the bricked railing of the roof, his back to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was dressed in all black, with what looked like a thick black
          sweatshirt with black pants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door to the rooftop closed behind me with a loud bang, but he
          didn't flinch, nor did he turn to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could be holding a gun now; I could literally shoot him right in the
          head...I could kill the boss of the Marino empire, and I would get
          away with it.
        </p>
        <p>He was unguarded, entirely open for any attack at any angle.</p>
        <p>
          But I didn't come here to kill him. That was for later. I only wanted
          to confirm my suspicions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was cold up here, and I let a shiver run through me as I
          walked to stand two feet away beside him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He still didn't turn to me, so I took that opportunity to study his
          demeanor. I watched as he blew thick white smoke from the cigar
          between his fingers out of his mouth, the white streak flying away
          with the wind, thinning as it danced into the dark depth of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Some would say it's foolish for a man like you to leave himself
          vulnerable." I broke the silence as I let my eyes roam over his face.
          He had a cut on his chin; a bruise was underneath his eye and the
          corner of his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slightly, ever so slightly, without so much as moving his head, he
          turned his gaze to me; his eyes were—squinty, hooded, exposed. I knew
          I wasn't tall, but how he looked at me made me feel like a grain of
          rice atop his shoe. His head was held high, but his eyes—peering down
          at me from the side, scanning me from toe to head, I couldn't help but
          take another step away instinctively.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away, shaking his head as if he didn't have the physical or
          emotional capacity to entertain my presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was something tense about the vibe he gave off; it made me want
          to leave him alone to continue his brooding, but when have I ever left
          shit alone?
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes noted Elio's dark hair, the same shade as Devil's, his full
          brows, the same curve as Devil's, and that nose, straight and perfect,
          maybe a little more perfect than Devil's. There was a distinct
          resemblance, one I hadn't noticed before because I had no reason to
          try to find a resemblance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was apparent; they were family—brothers maybe...half-brothers
          because Devil's eyes were a dark brown while Elio's were a smoky dark
          grey that held an intensity capable of drawing you into their depth.
        </p>
        <p>He loudly cleared his throat, startling me.</p>
        <p>
          "Your staring makes me very uncomfortable, and I am two seconds away
          from throwing you off this roof." He turned to me now, resting an
          elbow on the bricked railing, his brows drawn down in confusion. "How
          the fuck did you even get up here?"
        </p>
        <p>"The same way I stole from men like you without being caught."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes scanned me again; the look in them was heavy, making it
          difficult for me to decipher what really was going through his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You abandoned him, didn't you?" I blurted out, hoping to get a
          reaction out of him. His stare was blank.
        </p>
        <p>"He told you."</p>
        <p>
          "I figured it out. It was either an estranged friendship, exes with
          bad blood, or sibling abandonment. And seeing the distinct resemblance
          between you two, it wasn't hard to guess."
        </p>
        <p>
          His face remained blank, eyes raising an inch to my hair and then back
          to my eyes. He brought the cigar to his lips again, taking a long
          drag, which he never let out, but as he spoke, I could see whiffs of
          smoke escaping his mouth. "Meddling in my private affairs will only
          get you killed faster than I initially plan to. I'd suggest you forget
          everything you think you know and focus on why you're here."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You hurt him; it's not something I can forget; he's my best friend
          and family—"
        </p>
        <p>"You fuck your family?"</p>
        <p>"And you abandon yours?" I shot back, unblinking.</p>
        <p>
          It was only a step, just one step, and he was towering over me, eyes
          hard. "I didn't abandon him; I was <i>protecting</i> him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's a fat line between abandoning someone and protecting them. I
          don't know why you wanted to protect him, but you could have done that
          and still kept in touch; maybe then you both would welcome each other
          with a hug rather than a punch."
        </p>
        <p>
          Something flashed in his eyes, and he backed up a step, shaking his
          head as he turned again, his elbows resting on the brick railing as he
          brought the cigar stick to his lips again.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be the wind, or maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me, but
          there was a slight tremor in his hands as he pointedly looked ahead
          into the distance.
        </p>
        <p>He took another drag after hesitating for about five seconds.</p>
        <p>
          "Can I?" I motioned to the cigar, and his gaze fell on me again before
          shifting to the cigar and then back to me.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head. "No. It is bad for you."</p>
        <p>
          "Says the guy storing it inside his lungs instead of letting it out.
          It's bad for you too."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away from me again before muttering. "That's the point."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, wondering what the hell he meant by that.</p>
        <p>
          He wordlessly dropped the cigar beside him, not putting it out as he
          sighed, closing his eyes for a moment before opening them back, his
          jaw clenching and unclenching. "How is he? Still angry?" the concern
          in his voice told me it wouldn't be wise to taunt him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know Elio; I only knew <i>of</i> him. The whiplash I was
          getting from his behavior now was pretty concerning. The man I'd heard
          of wasn't capable of feeling; the man I feared wouldn't look so
          confused and—dare I say—lost.
        </p>
        <p>This has been a weird day—hell, this has been a weird week.</p>
        <p>
          "I wouldn't say angry," I said, placing my good elbow on the brick
          railing too. "More like—sad. Hurt. Confused."
        </p>
        <p>Elio nodded but kept quiet.</p>
        <p>He clasped his hands together like he was in deep thought.</p>
        <p>
          I stood there, wondering what the hell this was and why he hadn't
          attempted to throw me off the roof or even told me to leave him alone.
          But then again, I wouldn't because no matter how badly I wanted to
          stab him with a knife for shooting me, he looked even more disturbed
          than Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          And well—though it might be a terrible thought, he was vulnerable, and
          to break a man like Elio Marino, his weak spot was something I needed
          to know.
        </p>
        <p>I smiled to myself.</p>

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I HAD</b> been living in an illusion and should have known better.
          I was nothing like my father. My wrongdoings weren't automatically
          erased by the power I had. My mistakes weren't overlooked because of
          my last name. I couldn't get away with my carelessness because others
          around me were willing to point it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't say I didn't care about the truth—maybe I thought I didn't
          care, perhaps no one had been brave enough to face me and call me out
          on my ignorance. But no matter how hard I wanted to pretend or be as
          terrible as my father had been, I couldn't erase my conscience or the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd abandoned him. I didn't think about how my actions would have
          affected him. I was just too blinded by revenge; I was too gone in
          this grand finale—I'd hoped he wouldn't care. Perhaps he would find
          his own life and wouldn't even shed a tear when everything was said
          and done.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was wrong. He cared. <i>He fucking cared</i>, and it was a big
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia wasn't supposed to love me or hate me. How the fuck do I get the
          guarantee that I could proceed with my plans without hurting the
          person I'd spent almost all my life protecting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Little one shifted beside me, and I remembered I wasn't alone. I
          remembered she had been the one to call me out on my ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It irritated me, but she was always right. Her adequateness was
          probably why I didn't bother to shield or deny anything because the
          look in those dark, stubborn eyes told me there was no point.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd have to kill her for it, her and anyone she'd unfortunately tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It wasn't my intention," I said into the silence between us. "All I
          wanted was to protect him from all of this. But then he met you and
          started to steal. And now he's here."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Devil was the way he was before he met me. Hell, he was worse. STREET
          tamed him, tamed his anger, and you should be grateful for that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed my gaze to settle on her again; her hair was blowing all
          over her face due to the light wind—so unkempt—but I couldn't look
          away. My fingers itched to fix it. Clean it. Clean her.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you have a hairband?" I asked before I could hold my tongue.</p>
        <p>
          She raised a brow, clearly caught off guard by my question. "What?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A hair—hold on." I stood upright, digging my hand into my pants
          pocket, pulling out my packet of cigars, and removing the black band
          I'd wrapped around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The small band had been around a small book whose hardcover had been
          pulling off. I unconsciously wrapped the band around my cigar packet
          when I'd glued it back. "Come here," I said, covering the band around
          my fingers and moving them in a gesture for her to step forward, ready
          to solve her mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why the—" she started to protest but cut off when I walked towards
          her instead. I made sure I was too close for comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked up at me with wide big brownish eyes, her lashes scattered
          about without care, her nose and cheeks dusted with light freckles
          that suited her skin tone. She had the face of a little girl. Innocent
          and sharp at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ignored the heat between our bodies as I began to smooth her hair
          away from her face; I tucked both sides behind her ears. Slowly, her
          brows eased from the frown of confusion they'd been in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I slightly tilted my head to the side as my fingers disappeared into
          her hair.
        </p>
        <p>I was wrong.</p>
        <p>
          Earlier at that meeting, I thought her hair was unhealthy, light—but
          fuck me—it had a fullness that had me bury my fingers further.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was soft, wavy, and—surprisingly, smelt divine, like—vanilla or
          amber; I couldn't decipher it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you doing?" her voice was coated in shock and uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Caring for your hair," my gaze fell to hers briefly before drawing
          back to her hair, "since you're too lazy to do it yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled her hair up in one swoop, curling the band to keep it in
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is important to care for your hair. To care for it like it's a
          child; because, like children, your hair is clueless on how to take
          care of itself." I said, successfully tying her hair in a small
          ponytail, as far high as the short length could go, and then I stepped
          back, accessing my work and nodding. "Good."
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked at me, giving me a very familiar look. One I usually
          received from people after saying or doing something that didn't fit
          their assumptions of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I returned to leaning on the railing, watching her swallow as she
          shook her head.
        </p>
        <p>"You're...very...weird."</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "I know. In order to avoid situations like this in the
          future, ensure you're well-arranged before you talk to me. I can't
          control the urge to fix things. And I do not care if I offend you by
          my actions."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Pinchazo pretencioso," she muttered under her breath.
          <i>Pretentious prick</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked in clear surprise, "¿Tú hablas español?" hiding the
          excitement in my voice was impossible. <i>You speak Spanish?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          She shot me a sweet but taunting smile. "Sí. ¿por qué?"
          <i>yes, why?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my brows, nodding because I was genuinely impressed; her
          Spanish was clean, smooth, and accented. "Where did you learn?" I
          asked in Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>"None of your business." She responded in Spanish too.</p>
        <p>
          The look that flashed through her eyes told me it was none of my
          business because she was probably ashamed of how she had learned. I
          would have pressed some more if I cared, but I didn't, so I dropped
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't deal with English right now, so I pushed the conversation
          to Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>"What kind of relationship do you share with Devil?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          She eyed me carefully, probably wondering why I continued the
          conversation instead of having her locked away for interrupting my
          peace. She was right to wonder because I was wondering the same thing.
          I didn't like her or the vibes she gave off. she was the opposite of a
          person I'd want to spend my time with. Nothing was captivating about
          her or her presence, she could offer me nothing, yet she was still
          here.
        </p>
        <p>"He's my best friend, a partner in crime, and a gang member."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "That cannot be right. You two have—you have another
          relationship."
        </p>
        <p>She raised a brow. "What makes you think that?"</p>
        <p>
          "I might be sick in the head, but I'm not blind. Aside from the
          thieving addiction you both share with the other members of your
          <i>gang</i>, I know you and Devil are something more."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, what if we are? What's it to you?" there was a defensive tone to
          her voice as she pinned me with a hard glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't stop my eyes from taking her in from head to toe and back
          to her head. "He's my blood. It concerns me the kind of woman he
          chooses to get intimate with."
        </p>
        <p>
          She scoffed, letting out a humorless laugh. "What the fuck is wrong
          with me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused, trying to find what was wrong with her physically; when I
          couldn't find anything, I shook my head and said. "Everything is wrong
          with you. You're a bad influence on him. You and the others."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her glare hardened, and she took two steps towards me, the wind
          blowing the seductive smell of her hair to my face as she somehow
          managed an intimidating stance. "Talk shit about me all you want, but
          leave the others out."
        </p>
        <p>"The others are also to blame for who my brother is today."</p>
        <p>
          Her lips curved into a small snare. "Maybe you need to grow up and
          realize that Devil is not a kid but an adult who can very well choose
          the kind of people he wants to fuck with."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shoved both my hands into my pocket, standing at my full height and
          basking in how she remained firm before me, almost like she could take
          me if challenged to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking around the vast expanse, I took a step closer to her, and she
          took one back. I sniffed slightly, my head turning back to her as I
          leaned down, my gaze meeting hers square on. Her warm breath fanned my
          face as I spoke. "Or...I could kill you," I switched back to English,
          "and the others, and then make Devil do whatever the fuck I want.
          Because I fucking can, and because it would give me nothing but joy to
          see him far away from you, criminals."
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched me in confusion for a few seconds before she laughed. She
          fucking laughed at my face, and I leaned away from her.
        </p>
        <p>"Not only are you fucking weird, but you're also funny."</p>
        <p>"You think that was me trying to be funny."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. You call us criminals? Have you met yourself? What we do is
          steal to fucking survive. But you, you kill people for power, betray
          family for status, you don't give two shits about how your actions
          affect the lives of people around you. People call you the wicked; for
          fuck sake, you hurt innocent people just because they're related to
          those who offend you. You think that's not criminal?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed her words sink in, and I took another step back. "What I do
          is not criminal. It's worse. I should die for it. I <i>will</i> die
          for it eventually. But Devil is the sweetest fucking kid I've ever
          known...this life, this world that I live in, he doesn't deserve to
          live it. I have done...<i>things</i> just to make sure he doesn't get
          to live it, to give him what I never had. To give him peace,
          happiness, love, and fucking normalcy."
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, her eyes searching mine, silently asking why I
          couldn't see the actual problem between Devil and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haven't you ever considered that he doesn't want that? Why are you
          projecting your idea of a normal happy life onto him? He's not you,
          Elio. He's Devil; he's his own person."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You do not understand," I said. "I lived this life, I'm currently
          living it, and I don't want him to experience what I have. Hell, I
          don't give a shit about you, and I still think there are better ways
          you can survive. You're young; you could find decent work, go to
          school, live a life where you don't have to watch your shoulders every
          damn second."
        </p>
        <p>
          Indignation brought her brows down to a frown. "You think I don't want
          that? The same way you got into this business without a fucking choice
          is the same way I found STREET. You don't know what it's like out
          there, the fucking horrors I've been through." Her voice shook.
          "Forgive me if I can't stomach the thought of being around normal
          people who would judge me because of my mental and physical scars."
        </p>
        <p>Annoyed, I massaged my head. "You're missing the point, Sport."</p>
        <p>"No, <i>Dad</i>, I'm not."</p>
        <p>I cringed, irritation crawling up my spine. "What the—"</p>
        <p>
          "Just because your father put a gun in your hand when you were just a
          little boy doesn't mean you try to push your opinion into someone
          else's life."
        </p>
        <p>I kept quiet.</p>
        <p>
          "If you want to build a relationship with your brother, try not to be
          controlling and be more accepting. If you're clueless on how to start
          with that, maybe begin by actually telling people that you're both
          related because if you don't know, that shit hurts him more than you
          abandoning him."
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to leave, taking a few steps away from me before pausing
          and walking back to me, this time with venom in her eyes and a
          firmness to her steps that had me backing up. "And don't you ever, in
          your fucking life, call me <i>Sport</i>, or any other fucking
          derogatory nicknames, because I'll be backing that shit up with daddy
          jokes that'll make you feel like ants are crawling up your fucking
          ass. Don't test me." Then she was off; I watched her disappear out the
          roof door, the silence encasing me again.
        </p>
        <p>I blinked.</p>
        <p>
          The shock had my mouth dry, with my gaze still trained on the door she
          had disappeared through.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head before looking away from the door and reaching for my
          cigar pack. I got one stick out and shoved it between my lips—pausing
          shortly after to look at the roof door again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed in amusement, shaking my head yet again.

        <p>
          <b>THEY REMOVED</b> the sling two weeks later and wrapped my shoulder
          with a small bandage. The pain had subsided a little, and the wound
          was healing but showed signs of scarring. This was one of the times I
          thanked my body for its fast-healing ability.
        </p>
        <p>On my back laid so many scars I'd talked my head into forgetting.</p>
        <p>
          It was better to shove that part of my life to the darkest corners of
          my mind until I genuinely couldn't remember how exactly I got them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time Devil saw them, he asked me what had happened, and I
          told him I couldn't remember. To his better knowledge, half of my past
          had been wiped from my memory because of how traumatic they were.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't get nightmares anymore; my nights were always dreamless, and
          I was grateful for that. It only solidified my answers to where I got
          my scars.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't remember.</p>
        <p>I did.</p>
        <p>
          But I didn't.
          <i>I can't remember it and can't afford to trigger it. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The bullet wound would most definitely scar, and I was pissed because
          I'd have to get even. No one puts a scar on me and lives to tell the
          fucking story about it.
        </p>
        <p>Every single scar on my back had been paid for.</p>
        <p>In blood.</p>
        <p>
          First, I had to make sure Elio meant nothing to Devil. But I doubted
          it. Our conversation two weeks ago was proof that he cared about the
          bastard, and somehow, the bastard happened to care about Devil too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't afford to ruin my friendship with Devil, so with this, I
          would have to tread carefully and approach him gently because he was
          the only leverage I had against Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were all in the living room. Pizza boxes opened on the table
          while they strategized. I had changed into one of Devil's shirts and a
          short. My hair was still slightly wet and unbrushed as I settled on
          one of the single couches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk was sprawled on the ground, reading a magazine about disguise
          stories; weird, but okay. Dog was also on the floor, checking all the
          equipment Angelo had provided upon his requests. Upper was on his
          laptop, his brows furrowed in concentration, and Devil was on his
          phone beside him, probably mastering the layout of Club Eden.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow, who would have thought there would come a day when we'd be all
          so serious about a mission?" I mused, stretching to get a slice of
          pizza, taking a bite from it, and moaning at the taste.
        </p>
        <p>"Wrong, Upper's on porn hub." Dog said without looking up.</p>
        <p>
          "Rot in the burning furnace of hell, Dog," Upper responded while Devil
          took a small peek at Upper's screen before returning his attention to
          his phone. "I'm checking if my eyes inside Club Eden are still intact,
          It's past one hour, and I'm still not getting life feeds."
        </p>
        <p>"You think there was a mistake with the wiring?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          Upper glanced at me with a glare. "I never make mistakes." His
          concentration went back to the screen again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe you should take a break. You've been glaring at the screen for
          five hours now." Devil suggested, his eyes still on his phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't remember asking for your opinion." Upper didn't lift his
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't remember giving a fuck about you not asking for it," Devil
          responded.
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe mind your bloody business."</p>
        <p>"Maybe don't be a fucking dick."</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>
          The pizza was paused midway to my mouth; Dog and Milk's attention
          trained slowly on Upper and Devil, who were still focused on the task
          they seemed <i>too focused</i> on.
        </p>
        <p>Dog looked at me and mouthed. "What the fuck?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know." I mouthed back.</p>
        <p>
          Milk sighed loudly. "I think we all need a break. We've been too
          focused on planning because this is our first job after the last one,
          which landed us here. We're on edge."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No shit," Dog said, stopping his task and stretching his muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil scooted away from Upper, "You guys know we can leave, right?
          Like we could literally slip out, and no one would notice. The
          security around us is weak. We can take them. We still have some money
          saved up, it might not take us around the world, but it's enough to
          get us new identities and tickets out of Italy."
        </p>
        <p>I sat up. "If we leave, then we say goodbye to this opportunity."</p>
        <p>
          Dog frowned. "What fucking opportunity? Devil's right; we don't have
          to go through with this shit."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, we don't, but our options for leaving should be reserved until
          we're actually in danger and we have no choice but to take flight." 
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, you want to what? Steal from Marino?" Upper asked, his attention
          finally leaving the laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. We take back what they took from us. We stole that money. It's
          ours, and we won't leave without it. Listen, guys, we can turn this
          around."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Babe, I understand you," Milk said, weary in her eyes, "But there's a
          limit to how brave I can be. I know when to raise my flag in defeat."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, we're far from being defeated, Milk. We have so much more
          leverage than you think."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you talking about?" Devil asked, the frown back to his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio Marino isn't as untouchable as he paints himself out to be.
          There's got to be a weak link somewhere. His first mistake was keeping
          us alive."
        </p>
        <p>"That sounds like a fucking blessing to me." Dog countered.</p>
        <p>
          "I didn't mean it like that. What I meant is that He kept us alive
          because he needs us. That means, as much as he wants to put a bullet
          through our heads, he has to wait until we are useless to him."
        </p>
        <p>Devil eyed me suspiciously.</p>
        <p>I knew I sounded so assured as if I knew something they didn't.</p>
        <p>
          Devil's connection to Elio, and our connection to Devil, was the only
          thing keeping us alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were Devil's family, and if Elio touched any of us, he'd lose the
          only family he had left. We're pretty much set to wreak havoc as long
          as Devil was by our side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Everyone and everything is replaceable to Marino; don't be fooled,"
          Devil said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I doubt that," I said, my eyes searching his. "Look at us; we're
          treated like guests instead of prisoners. I mean, we're eating fucking
          pizza. We have access to our phones and the internet. What hostage
          eats pizza and accesses the internet? That should tell you something."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, or maybe he's got a fucking pet crocodile, and he's treating us
          good because his crocodile loves fresh, well-fed happy meat. And by
          meat, I mean us." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk lightly slapped his arm. "This is not a movie. Who has a
          crocodile for a pet?"
        </p>
        <p>Devil chuckled. "You'd be surprised."</p>
        <p>
          "All right, fine," Upper dropped the laptop in the space between him
          and Devil. "Say we decide not to make a run for it; how do you suppose
          we get our money back?"
        </p>
        <p>I curved my lips into a languid side smile.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The loud music from Elio's casino was the relief my whole body needed,
          and from the look on the faces of my beloveds, it was exactly what
          they needed too.
        </p>
        <p>"This better be a good idea," Devil muttered beside me.</p>
        <p>
          "Do you smell that?" I asked him, and he frowned, sniffing the air.
        </p>
        <p>"Weed?"</p>
        <p>"No. It's the smell of a great idea."</p>
        <p>
          "Nah," Dog said. "I just smell another bullet coming; this time, I
          don't think he'll miss."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't be such a drama king." Milk said. "I think we should all get
          very drunk and steal some money."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No stealing," Upper chided her, but in his eyes, swarm mischief.
          "We're gonna cheat ourselves some dollars. These fuckers won't know
          what hit them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned, feeling the rise of excitement in my stomach. "This,
          guys...is our zone. Let's make as much money as we can. And maybe we
          might be lucky enough for it to end in a huge casino fight."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog threw his arm around my shoulder, careful not to hurt my wound.
          "I'm a zombie slut for that genius brain of yours."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm, talk dirty to me." I leaned into him as we began walking amongst
          the crowd who didn't pay heed to us. Not yet. Soon they'd notice.
        </p>
        <p>"You guys are gonna get me killed one day," Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          "At least you'd die knowing you bagged a lot of money from the people
          who are meant to be untouchable." Milk responded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How long do you think they'd realize the soldiers assigned to watch
          us are no longer watching us," Dog asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "An hour or two before they realize the loop," Upper said. "Should
          supply us enough time to cause some trouble."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That is if we don't get reported to the boss himself, seeing as we
          are simply walking into his turf like his guests. Awesome." Devil
          said.
        </p>
        <p>"Live a little," Upper muttered.</p>
        <p>
          We stopped in the middle of the casino and club or whatever they
          called this sin bin, and Dog distributed some cash he'd stolen from
          the wallets of every soldier we'd encountered before reaching the
          casino. "The goal. Use these to win big."
        </p>
        <p>"I'll hit the tables," Upper said, going in the east direction.</p>
        <p>
          "I call Roulette my specialty." Milk said, already heading in that
          direction
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll be at the poker tables," Devil said without much enthusiasm.
        </p>
        <p>Dog and I looked at each other. "Blackjack?"</p>
        <p>I smiled and nodded. "Blackjack."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          An hour later, we had more than fifty eyes on us. We were winning, we
          were loud, and we were drunk as fuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhilarating feeling of winning and getting so many people angry
          never gets old.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had bagged so much money and almost caused a massive fight in the
          casino, but it was settled no thanks to Devil, who was drunk but still
          the soberest one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still had a sense of my surrounding and could still walk on my own
          two feet, but I felt very light, it seemed as though so many knots had
          loosened in my body, and for the first time in weeks, I felt...free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil had captured my attention about thirty minutes ago. We had been
          noticed. And there was a lot of secret whispering amongst some of the
          soldiers, and I was sure someone had gone to inform the bosses of the
          chaos we were creating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started to doubt myself when nothing was done about it and when
          nobody came down to collect us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two hours flew by, and we were still winning; Milk was already worn
          out, and we could already sense that it was our cue to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          It still bugged me that no one came to collect us or question our
          winning tactics. It was almost as if they didn't care because, at the
          end of the day, they'd take the money away from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We should go," Dog said, Milk appearing by his side as Upper joined
          Devil and me.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, we did good." I praised</p>
        <p>"We might do even better tomorrow." Milk said.</p>
        <p>
          Upper held the bags of money we had collectively won for the night.
        </p>
        <p>Devil looked around. "I think it's pretty weird—"</p>
        <p>
          Silence slowly stretched through the expanse of the club, cutting
          Devil off.
        </p>
        <p>
          People's attention automatically shifted to the roller-coaster stairs.
          Devil was the first to look there.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit," he muttered. "He came down himself."</p>
        <p>
          I turned to find Elio leisurely descending the stairs, his all-black
          outfit in place. Angelo and Casmiro came behind him, with Casmiro
          holding a black briefcase in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          My back straightened as they walked directly toward us. I was nearly
          sober just by the sight of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intensity of his presence doused the room of whatever fire that
          had got people going before. Some faces around us paled as he stopped
          before the guys and me.
        </p>
        <p>The DJ had even lowered the volume of the music.</p>
        <p>
          I could sense fear in the air, but I knew none of it was coming from
          me. Maybe it was the alcohol or the fact that I had pictured a
          thousand ways I could deal with him, but I found myself looking him in
          the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strong pull of challenge in those dark grey eyes seemed to look
          even deeper tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine evening...<i>STREET</i>. My people tell me you have made big
          wins tonight." Elio spoke first, his face expressionless while his
          voice faked wonder.
        </p>
        <p>"It's a really lucky night," I answered.</p>
        <p>
          "Isn't that just fabulous." He stated. "I am pleased to see that you
          are all enjoying your <i>freedom</i> in my compound. It must feel like
          a vacation for you,"
        </p>
        <p>"You have no idea," I responded.</p>
        <p>
          Devil stepped forward. "We don't want any trouble; we just wanted a
          break from—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's okay." I cut him off. "He knows we don't want trouble; he's only
          commending us for how lucky we were tonight, right?" I threw the
          question at Elio, and his left brow twitched, but he nodded.
        </p>
        <p>"Indeed. It's truly outstanding, this thing called luck."</p>
        <p>
          I laughed in mock wonder, like this was a casual conversation we had
          all the time. "I know, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's brows shot up in agreement. "Yes, in fact, I was so inspired by
          this luck of yours that I decided, why not come down to see if I can
          interest you in a small game of chess, nothing serious."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him as I locked my jaw, his grey eyes shining in a
          challenge. I wanted to quench that shine so bad my whole body itched
          for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn't break eye contact for about a minute, and I knew he dared me
          to say no. He wanted to teach me a lesson.
        </p>
        <p>I knew that look so fucking well.</p>
        <p>Tilting my head a bit to the side, I asked. "What's the catch?"</p>
        <p>
          He signaled with his hand to Casmiro, who stepped forward with a frown
          of disinterest as he opened the briefcase. I almost doubled over at
          the sight of the clean stacked bundle of dollar notes, arranged
          perfectly in a mouthwatering way.
        </p>
        <p><i>Fucking greed. </i></p>
        <p>
          Elio straightened, "We play five rounds. Three of five winner takes
          your earnings for the night and the briefcase."
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a lot of willpower to drag my eyes from the money back to his.
        </p>
        <p>It was risky; we could lose all we earned tonight if I agreed.</p>
        <p>"And if I don't agree?"</p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched, and he took a step closer to me, burying both hands
          into his pockets as he gave me that degrading look again, where it
          seemed like I was only a speck of dust on his shoe.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Allow me to reiterate, <i>Sport</i>. You do not have a choice in this
          proposal."
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck." Dog cursed under his breath.</p>
        <p>I stepped closer to Elio, looking up at him with determination.</p>
        <p>"If that's the case, allow me to add a new catch."</p>
        <p>"What would that be?"</p>
        <p>
          "A chance to renegotiate the terms of me and my people's service to
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought about it for only a few seconds before nodding. "Okay. I
          would also like to add a catch."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm listening."</p>
        <p>
          "I get to tie you up, shoot your good shoulder and knee caps, and then
          throw you off that roof. In simpler words, I kill you."
        </p>
        <p>I didn't flinch.</p>
        <p>Devil shook his head. "Zahra don't—"</p>
        <p>"Deal."</p>
        <p>
          Elio's eyes searched mine, and I briefly saw surprise in them before
          it was masked with indifference.
        </p>
        <p>He exited my personal space, and I let my breathing flow freely.</p>
        <p>
          Straightening his suit, Elio outstretched his hand in the direction
          behind me. "Let's play, Sport."

        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>THE SILENCE</b> around us was deafening.</p>
        <p>
          It was a complete contradistinction to how my mind had been for the
          past two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond ridiculous was the perfect definition to give to my actions.
          The chess, the bargain.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was out of character, and if the glare Casmiro was giving me served
          any indication, it was that I was slowly losing it, and it was
          showing.
        </p>
        <p>I don't do this.</p>
        <p>
          I don't stoop to such levels to grant myself an opportunity to kill
          someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never once have I sat amid so many people trying to prove to myself
          and this amateur that she couldn't intimidate or undermine me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her little warning at the rooftop had started taking effect the
          following day. I realized there was anger inside me over the fact that
          she had successfully gotten the last word.
        </p>
        <p>It was a petty feeling.</p>
        <p>It was immature.</p>
        <p>It shouldn't matter. Nothing except my end goal should matter.</p>
        <p>
          Maybe that was the reason I was pissed. She sneaked right underneath
          my skin. She compelled a wave of unnecessary anger from me, and the
          distaste of that feeling was far from appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
          And she had no right to mess with my focus the way she did. The little
          stunt she pulled with my brother and the rest of these street people;
          stealing from me, cheating in my casino, gambling with thievery. It
          was egregious.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was irritated by it. They had no shame. No fear for their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did she tell them? Do they know they're alive because my brother cared
          for them? Do they think him a fucking leverage over me?
        </p>
        <p>Were they using him to get to me?</p>
        <p>
          The whole build-up had led to this very moment, with her sitting
          across from me, the chess board between us, Casmiro and Angelo by my
          side, while her gang members stood by hers.
        </p>
        <p>They didn't like this.</p>
        <p>
          It was evident in how they eyed my opponent, the Chessboard, and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          An aura of uncertainty lingered in the air around us, and studying the
          look on her face, they would most likely lose every penny they had
          stolen tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her stubborn eyes lifted from the chess board, and our gazes locked.
          She didn't look away, and neither did I.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was fucking unnerving how she portrayed the stance of being in
          control. Jaw set, eyes hard and calculating. It made me curious to
          know how she had groomed herself into doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had gone out of my way, trying to look into her background...to fish
          out information about her life after the move to Italy, but there was
          none. I understood she had been sold, which meant narrowing the search
          toward sex traffickers and the private institution for child
          trafficking. But no one had heard of this girl. Her name was in the
          system. Zahra Faizan. Her place of birth. Her face. Her Mother's name
          and background. Father unknown. It wasn't suspicious because her
          mother had been a womb donor, and her last name was chosen.
        </p>
        <p>She was a discombobulating mystery.</p>
        <p>I do not like mysteries.</p>
        <p>
          She looked away first, her focus settling on the board as we began.
        </p>
        <p>All eyes watched us.</p>
        <p>And I watched her.</p>
        <p>
          Her long fingers hovered on the board, and her confidence dwindled. A
          few seconds into it, her face finally hinted at what and how she was
          feeling. Her brows were drawn down in a frown, almost as if she was
          unsure of the first move to make. When she made it...
        </p>
        <p>I relaxed.</p>
        <p>She was an idiot.</p>
        <p>I found her eyes on me when I looked up.</p>
        <p>
          In Spanish, I spoke while making my move. "If you didn't know how to
          play, why did you agree to my terms?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have never been known to back down from a challenge." She responded
          in Spanish before looking down and making another dumb move.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, already mapping out my first win with my next move.
          "How did you survive this far with such low thinking capacity?"
        </p>
        <p>Move after move; she was losing.</p>
        <p>
          A smile curved at the side of her lips. "I have been told countless
          times how amazing I am. I think that quality serves as the charm of my
          essence."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm afraid I don't see it." I responded, switching to English as I
          made my next move and said, "Checkmate."
        </p>
        <p>She sucked in a breath, sitting up as she watched the board.</p>
        <p>Dog leaned into Zahra's side. "You should fucking quit this."</p>
        <p>
          She was quiet, studying the board before answering him without looking
          away, "Didn't you hear? I have no choice. Not only is our money on the
          line, but my life is too."
        </p>
        <p>
          We started the second round, and it was the same thing. She made lousy
          moves, throwing herself off. I would have suggested she did it all on
          purpose if I didn't know better.
        </p>
        <p>
          "At least make an effort to pretend like you know what you're doing,"
          I said back to Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her brows came down in a frown. "Stop talking." She responded in the
          dialect without looking up.
        </p>
        <p>
          She made her move, opening the ground floor for me to win the second
          round.
        </p>
        <p>"You realize if you lose this, you're dying, right?"</p>
        <p>Her fist clenched and unclenched. "You made that very clear."</p>
        <p>
          I should have known she was all talk. There was no challenge here.
        </p>
        <p>
          After three more moves, I called Checkmate, and the look on her face
          was the definition of unsettled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let me take her place," Devil said, already seeing that the odds
          weren't in her favor. "Same terms."
        </p>
        <p>I would have laughed if it wasn't physically tasking.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"It's clearly a rip-off; she doesn't know how to play the game—"</p>
        <p>
          I shot him a glare. "Not another word from you. Stay out of this."
        </p>
        <p>"This is fucking—"</p>
        <p>"It's okay," She cut in. "I can handle this."</p>
        <p>
          Upper shook his head slowly, "You're losing, love. Embarrassingly."
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked back at the board as I arranged it. "We still have three
          winning rounds. There's still hope. I love my kneecaps too much to
          risk them." She said, her smile taunting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was irritated by the unseriousness in her voice. The fucking
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started the next round. Her first move was a fucking foul; I almost
          felt sorry for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would mark the most terrible chess opponent I'd ever had. Her
          confidence should be giving her a good dose of embarrassment now. I
          wasn't in her shoes, but I knew I would have called it quit at this
          point, with all the eyes watching us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she kept going, and I kept killing her off, one by one. With my
          eyes closed, I could take a hundred to none wins from her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head when she made a move that elicited groans from the
          people behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we made a move after move, I knew there was no way she was winning
          this.
        </p>
        <p>She was an insult to the game of—</p>
        <p>"Checkmate."</p>
        <p>
          My thoughts seized, and I stopped short, allowing my mind to replay
          her move as my eyes studied the board.
        </p>
        <p>When I caught my mistake, my jaw clenched.</p>
        <p>Angelo whistled.</p>
        <p>
          "Donde esta tu mente?" Where's your mind? She asked me, her voice
          leveled.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I raised my head, I caught her gaze, shimmering with a smugness
          that pulled out a glare from me.
        </p>
        <p>Her smile widened.</p>
        <p>I sat up. "Next round."</p>
        <p>I reset the board again, and we started.</p>
        <p>
          Her demeanor changed completely, making my ability to read her next
          move non-existent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tension around us escalated by the second, and. Move after move,
          my anger flared. I became utterly uneasy, releasing the hold of my tie
          around my neck.
        </p>
        <p>"You are too open." She said in Spanish, her voice concentrated.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted across the board, and I thought hard before making my
          next move. She couldn't see her win. It was covered. Only a
          professional would spot it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she made the wrong move now, I would win the round without me
          having to move anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her brows fell in a frown, taking the bait. She let a breath fall
          through, and then she made her move.
        </p>
        <p>My eyes snapped up the moment she raised her eyes from the board.</p>
        <p>She smiled before saying, "Checkmate."</p>
        <p>
          "Fucking diabolical," Upper said, releasing a breath he seemed to have
          been holding.
        </p>
        <p>
          She relaxed back. "This is fun?" a grin split across her lips, and
          Devil scoffed in amusement. "I'm having so much fun," she continued,
          ignoring the look on my face. "Last round, Dad?"
        </p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>
          After the last round, I shot to my feet as Casmiro handed the
          briefcase to the hollering demons.
        </p>
        <p>She won.</p>
        <p>Not for one second did her eyes leave mine.</p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat. "Come with me; let's see about that renegotiating
          you discussed."
        </p>
        <p>
          She stood up, dusting whatever the hell she was wearing. "Gladly."
        </p>
        <p>"I'll come with," Devil said.</p>
        <p>"No." I pinned him with a stern look. "She'll come alone."</p>
        <p>
          Devil frowned, a warning in his eyes that had me grunting another
          addition to my statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She'll return alive," I said with a twinge of disinterest, but when
          he didn't budge, I almost groaned when I added. "Unharmed."
        </p>
        <p>
          His features relaxed as he looked at the girl, who didn't seem fazed
          by our exchange. The others were too busy salivating over the content
          in the briefcase to notice anything.
        </p>
        <p>"It's fine," she told him. "I can take care of myself."</p>
        <p>
          "You're sure?" he asked her, undeniable concern shining in his eyes.
          "I can take care of it if you—"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm sure, Devil. I can handle him."</p>
        <p>"And I can still hear you," I said.</p>
        <p>
          She shot a sweet smile my way, her lips pouting a little. "I know,
          Dad."
        </p>
        <p>
          My insides curled, and I looked away when I realized I wasn't looking
          but staring. "Angelo, escort her up," I said, walking away with
          Casmiro.
        </p>
        <p>"Why the fuck did she call you...Dad?"</p>
        <p>
          I suppressed a sigh, craving the damaging comfort of my cigar.
          "Because I called her Sport...twice." <br /><br /><br /><br />

          I'm suffering from a concussion after a home accident last night.
          While editing this, I felt very confused, and the massive headache
          wasn't helping. I hope this update doesn't come out weird. I'll
          probably retouch it when my head feels much better.
        </p>
        <p>

          you think of the story so far!

          Random Question: What's that thing that almost killed you? (Mine was
          water, I slipped last night, and my head took a hit to the ground, I
          saw white. Gwen from THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN didn't deserve that. cause
          damn. it hurts like hell.)

      <div>
        <p>
          Thank you for your good wishes in the previous chapter! I'm doing much
          better now! you guys are amazing! don't forget to comment on this as
          you read!
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy the update ;)<br /></p>
        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>HE WAS</b> alone when Angelo opened the door to the room we'd
          discussed Dion Juan Pablo. It was the same as the first time I was
          here; way too clean with everything in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the door closed behind me without so much of a good luck from
          Angelo, I turned my attention to Elio, who was placing down what
          looked like an expensive bottle of red wine along sides two wine
          glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          He brought out a small white cloth, cleaning the glass with extra
          care.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed he had discarded his suit and tie, and his black shirt was
          rolled up to his elbows, revealing the tattoos on his left hand again,
          but unlike the first time, there was a small bandage wrapped around
          the inner part of his forearm. He'd probably sustained an injury
          between the meeting day and now.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever caused it, I hoped it hurt like a bitch.</p>
        <p>He glanced toward me the moment I started making my way to him.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't touch anything; just come forward." He said, then looked away,
          still carefully cleaning the glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's with the audio description," I asked, standing opposite him,
          with the mini bar counter separating us. "I was already coming without
          touching anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          Either he didn't understand my statement's double meaning, or he
          decided to ignore me, but his face showed no hint of discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one can tell with people like you," He said, face void of emotion.
          "You think they're going to go one direction, and they end up going
          the other."
        </p>
        <p>
          I eyed him, noting how he didn't look up to meet my eyes. He was
          entirely focused on the very unnecessary cleaning he was doing.
        </p>
        <p>Taking a sit on one of the bar stools, I watched him.</p>
        <p>
          His eyelashes weren't all that full, but they were thick, very
          arranged, and pretty long for a man who was supposed to be wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flicked to his lips; it had that rich, attractive fullness
          that had my stare lingering for a little too long. His face
          was—perfect, completely scarless—asides from the fading cut he had
          sustained with Devil's beating weeks ago. My gaze ran down to his
          neck, spotting a glimpse of the tattoo there. I wanted to know—
        </p>
        <p>"You're staring again," he said without looking up.</p>
        <p>
          I placed my hand underneath my chin, still looking at him. "You're a
          hot guy with a pretty face. I can't help myself."
        </p>
        <p>
          His attention snapped from the glass to me, dark grey eyes showing
          apparent surprise. I batted my lashes, giving him a sweet smile. He
          looked away again, dropping the glass, clearing his throat, and
          picking up the second glass.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you get off from annoying people around you?" He asked.</p>
        <p>"No, but I could totally get off on that face of yours."</p>
        <p>His cleaning seized, and our eyes locked again.</p>
        <p>"Stop." He warned, lips curling in what looked like discomfort.</p>
        <p>Perfect.</p>
        <p>
          I got more comfortable on the stool. "You've been cleaning the glass
          for minutes now. Do you have OCD?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked down at the glass again, cleaning delicately, while his
          rings clinked on the frame from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Then pour the fucking wine, and let's talk business."</p>
        <p>
          He steadied both glasses in one hand while he used the other to wipe
          the counter slowly and delicately before dropping both glasses on it,
          then neatly folded the cloth and tucked it away like he would have
          hurt it if he hadn't folded it.
        </p>
        <p>Fucking weirdo.</p>
        <p>He poured wine into both glasses, shifting one toward me.</p>
        <p>
          Reaching behind him, he pulled out a gun, and my eyes followed as he
          carefully placed it on the counter before grabbing his drink and
          twirling it softly as he walked around the counter to stand right next
          to me, with a three-feet distance between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          He leveled me with his stern gaze, which quickly flickered to my messy
          hair and my face again. "I'll consider renegotiating your case only
          when I know whom I'm negotiating with."
        </p>
        <p>
          He had looked me up. Didn't find anything of use. It was probably why
          he wanted to know what everyone else didn't.
        </p>
        <p>"That wasn't our deal."</p>
        <p>
          He took a sip from his glass. "Did we make one? I don't remember
          signing any document or agreeing to anything legally with you; I think
          you must be confused; you did have a lot to drink tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a step closer to him. "You fucking bastard, I should have known
          your word meant nothing."
        </p>
        <p>"I never said it did."</p>
        <p>
          "Then what am I fucking doing here?" I hissed, turning to leave, but
          he grabbed my wrist, pulling me back. I tried to wrench my hand free,
          but his grip was firm.
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't dismiss you."</p>
        <p>
          I shot him a glare which soon turned into that sweet smile that made
          him uncomfortable. "Oh, sorry, Principal Marino, I didn't know I had
          to ask for your permission before getting the fuck out of your face."
        </p>
        <p>He let me go instantly.</p>
        <p>"I told you I would reconsider your case." He said.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I heard that part, but it came with a little clause I don't
          think I want to fulfill."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, you'd rather subject yourself and your friends to me for the rest
          of your lives than tell me who you are?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You already know who I am. I'm Zahra, a very expensive thief who
          fucks your brother; what else do you wanna know?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He dropped the glass on the counter and shoved one hand into his pants
          pocket; the other rested on the counter as he drummed with his
          fingers. "What happened after you got sold."
        </p>
        <p>
          I flinched at the word 'sold,' He noticed it but didn't say anything.
        </p>
        <p>"I can't remember."</p>
        <p>"Lies."</p>
        <p>"They're not lies." I snapped.</p>
        <p>
          "From one liar to another, it's best not to evade my question with a
          lie. I'll spot it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached for my glass of wine, brought it to my lips, and downed it
          to the last drop before dropping it back on the counter next to his.
        </p>
        <p>The silence stretched as he waited for me to speak.</p>
        <p>
          I crossed my arm against my chest. "What would you do if I don't wish
          to disclose my life's journey?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'll kill you for wasting my time."</p>
        <p>"You promised Devil you wouldn't hurt me."</p>
        <p>"I promised I'd never leave him, and I did. An hour later."</p>
        <p>I watched him, and he watched me.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered to the gun on the counter, and he mirrored my
          action.
        </p>
        <p>Our eyes locked again.</p>
        <p>
          He read my mind, and I read him, and then we were both rushing to get
          the gun, but I was faster. I grabbed the gun steady on my grip,
          removed the safety, aimed it at him, and then pulled the trigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was fast, though, because before the shot faded, he swung at my
          wrist, knocking the gun from my hand as it clattered away into the
          distance. He gripped my arm and twisted it. I couldn't stop the
          painful scream that escaped me as a sharp pain shot right through my
          wounded shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took that opportunity to grab my second hand, twisting it and
          swiftly flicking our position. My back to his front as he shoved me
          against the counter, the wood digging tightly to my ribs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I fully turned, I caught a glimpse of blood on his left arm,
          his dress shirt was torn, and a flicker of satisfaction flowed through
          me because the bullet grazed him just like I intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to struggle, but the wound on my shoulder burned with pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let go of me." I gritted, feeling his back press against mine. He had
          me pinned between his body and the fucking counter.
        </p>
        <p>"That was an idiotic move, Sport."</p>
        <p>I pushed back, ignoring the pain. "Let me fucking go."</p>
        <p>
          "Careful, if you keep fighting me, It'll only take one push to break
          all your ribs."
        </p>
        <p>
          My body locked when my brain realized I could no longer control the
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrashed and pushed back, trying to squirm free of him, the stitches
          on my shoulder tearing open. "Let me go!" I screamed it, but it only
          tightened his grip on my wrist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't move, couldn't escape; there was no opening, no space to
          breathe, no escape.
        </p>
        <p>No escape.</p>
        <p>
          Panic set in, and my breathing quickened. "Let go of me, Elio!" My
          voice shook.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was winded, entirely out of it. I threw my head back, hoping to hit
          him, but somehow, I missed, or maybe I threw my head to the side; I
          didn't fucking know.
        </p>
        <p>
          All I knew was that I had no control. I was trapped. And there was no
          escape.
        </p>
        <p>"Leave me alone! Let me go!"</p>
        <p>
          He released his hold but didn't let me go. "Calm down." He snapped,
          his voice very close to my ear.
        </p>
        <p>My chest heaved, "Get away from me, or I swear to God—"</p>
        <p>
          "Calm down," He repeated, his voice softening, but he still held me,
          and alarm bells rang in my head.
        </p>
        <p>"Let me go first."</p>
        <p>"Not until you remember how to fucking breathe."</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck you!" I heaved, collected air into my lungs, realizing I wasn't
          entirely pressed to the counter anymore.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, but calm down first."</p>
        <p>
          My pulse was still racing, and I was still trying to regain control of
          my ringing ears.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you calm?" He asked.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          It took two minutes until I could think properly and hear clearly
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I drew in a breath and released it with my response. "I'm calm now.
          Let me go."
        </p>
        <p>
          He did, and I wasted no time turning and swinging at his face. My fist
          slammed into his stupid fucking perfect nose, and I was disappointed
          that I didn't hear a crack, but I must have torn something because he
          swore, cradling his nose on reflex while stumbling back as blood
          poured from his nostrils.
        </p>
        <p>Good.</p>
        <p>I held my shoulder, the pain making my knees weak.</p>
        <p>
          He hissed, swiftly wiping the blood with irritation bringing down his
          brows. "You throw a good punch; I'll give you that."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes shifted to the bullet graze on his arm before looking at him
          again. "I aim to please. I'll also ensure I don't miss the next time I
          shoot you."
        </p>
        <p>"Your aim is pitiful. I'm not worried."</p>
        <p>
          I scoffed out a humorless laugh. "I never fucking miss. The only
          reason you're alive is because Devil fucking cares if you're
          breathing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Amazing, because that's the only reason you and your little choir
          group remain breathing too."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, you can try to kill me; I promise you won't succeed."</p>
        <p>"You're so certain."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh yes, I am," I took a step back. "I was shoved in a room with
          twenty horny armed men, and I was the only one who came out breathing.
          My luck doesn't end with gambling."
        </p>
        <p>His face hardened. "Who the fuck are you?"</p>
        <p>
          A smile curved at the side of my lips. "Wouldn't you like to know?"
          Then I turned, opened the door, and walked out.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't stop me.</p>
        <p>
          I walked straight ahead, hearing the door close behind me as I rounded
          the corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spotted Casmiro pacing back and forth, and I didn't stop as he
          looked up, complete shock and horror in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He'd heard the gunshot and probably thought it meant I was dead.</p>
        <p>
          My smile widened as I brushed passed him. "Hey Cassie, you might wanna
          check on your boss." I threw over my shoulder without stopping.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit," he cursed before I heard his footsteps rushing toward the room
          I had just left.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Amateurs," I muttered, but the smile on my lips followed me through
          my walk back to the Casino.
        </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          Thank you for the love you've shown this story so far! Don't forget to
          comment as you read, I love feedback, It's the juice of my creativity,
          the Romeo to my Juliet, the Devil to my Zahra--I mean, Elio to
          my--Fuck.
        </p>
        <p>Just--Enjoy this surprise update!<br />_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>THE FACT </b>that she put up a fight wasn't even surprising.</p>
        <p>
          Her stealth and the absence of hesitation when she raised the gun and
          pulled the trigger was the thing that threw me off.
        </p>
        <p>
          It showed me that it wasn't the first time she had held a gun or shot
          at someone, and her statement before she left, had my mind bordering
          on curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Zahra Faizan isn't politics, so why am I curious about her?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Why had she occupied more space than politics in my mind? Why am I
          having an inner monologue about a woman? Not just any woman; the one
          who should die for even pointing a gun at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't care to know," I voiced as the needle pierced my skin, with
          Angelo stitching up the grazing from my own fucking bullet. She didn't
          know how close she was to razing my whole plan. If that bullet had
          killed me, my soul would have never known peace. "I'm killing the
          short one."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo's gaze flicked to me. "We had a deal with them; we can't
          exactly go back on our word."
        </p>
        <p>"I can."</p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "For the thousandth time, we shouldn't ever go back on our
          words."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I relieved you of your duty years ago. I don't need your advice,
          Angelo."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, sticking the needle in again. "I will still offer
          it as long as I'm here, Marino."
        </p>
        <p>I looked at him. "Then leave."</p>
        <p>
          He scoffed. "And give you the chance and space to off yourself? Yeah,
          No. Not going to happen on my watch."
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, when he pressed the sharp edge of the needle to my skin, I
          flinched.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo made me very uncomfortable. It never used to be that way before
          he—saved me—he usually just did his job and managed his affairs with
          his men and the tech team, which he had taken upon himself to handle.
          He was the only other person who understood how politics worked, and
          he would have been fun to talk to if he didn't watch me like a hawk
          every time we were in the same space.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't help that he was probably the only one who didn't believe I
          had an ounce of wickedness inside of me. Because he knew—he knew what
          truth lay beneath the rumors that made me who I am.
        </p>
        <p>It was downright unsettling.</p>
        <p>
          "I've given you a good opportunity for a life outside this business;
          why won't you just take it and get out of my way," I said with a frown
          this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          He met my eyes. "Because this is my life, and you have no control over
          what I choose to do with it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's why you came to stitch me up instead of calling our medic."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. If our people find out you were shot by a woman, who is supposed
          to be your hostage, they will kill her and question your leadership.
          We can't have that now, can we?"
        </p>
        <p>"I want her dead."</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, that can be arranged. After they do what they're here for. As
          much as their presence brings chaos, we need access to the Pablos.
          They're the best bet we got."
        </p>
        <p>
          Right, Dion Juan Pablo...the ticket to the beginning of my goal. I
          needed to remember that STREET was a means to an end. I couldn't let
          Zahra get to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence followed after he said that. He put in the last stitch,
          applied a minty ointment, and covered up the wound.
        </p>
        <p>
          I broke the silence when he pulled back to couple the first aid
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You thought I did it to myself, didn't you? That's why you came
          running."
        </p>
        <p>
          With his back to me, I noted how his whole form tensed up, but he
          didn't respond. He just proceeded with arranging the first aid.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should stop worrying about that," I spoke, picking up the
          well-folded shirt beside me and slipping it on. "It's never going to
          happen again. I'm over it. I'm fine. I've got too much to live for,
          and it was only a mere slip-up. A mistake. You shouldn't use that as
          an excuse to remain in this business."
        </p>
        <p>
          He let out a sharp breath before turning to me, pinning me with a
          pained expression that he tried to mask but couldn't. "You know I lost
          my sister to suicide, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him as I buttoned up my shirt. "Yes, I'm well informed about
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "Before she finally succeeded, I'd saved her; I
          think—three, four times. It was never fun. It was traumatizing, and I
          still have nightmares featuring scenarios of the many ways I could
          have saved her if I had been there on time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him, unsure if I should mention how proud I was of his
          sister or apologize and do the 'I am sorry for your loss thing.'
        </p>
        <p>"What does that have to do with me?" I asked instead.</p>
        <p>
          "Your excuse and your 'I'm fine' is something I've heard before; the
          rise and fall of your voice showed the false reassurance you just
          tried to give me. I'm not a fool, Marino."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "You're a fool for wanting to remain here with me,
          Angelo. I'm not worth it. You should go live your life."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No...No, you should live your life. Leave the four walls of this—this
          cursed library—leave the freaking books with their fake words and fake
          lies woven to twist your mind into a fucking web of unrealistic
          scenarios and fucking socialize. Talk to real people. Go to real
          places. And for once in your fucking life, don't be a mastermind." He
          breathed, watching me as if pleading for his words to sink in.
        </p>
        <p>The silence stretched for a few seconds before I responded.</p>
        <p>"No thanks."</p>
        <p>
          His shoulders sagged. "At least see a doctor. A fucking therapist."
        </p>
        <p>
          I got up from the stool and walked to the nearest shelf. "You see
          these books, Angelo. They're the only therapy I need. Whenever I read
          them, it's like my sister's here, reading them to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But she's not." Something like pity glazed over his words. It didn't
          faze me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mariana loved reading books. She'd spend so much money on the little
          books she could get without our father knowing. He never liked them.
          Thought they were silly. My mother never objected to his reasoning.
          She never objected to many of his twisted thoughts and actions. It was
          probably her only flaw. Asides from that, mother was perfect." I said,
          picking up a book from the shelf.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I always teased Mariana because she loved filling her head up with
          these romance books. As you called them fake scenarios, I did that
          too. And she would glare at me so fiercely I'd wish I could laugh or
          smile at her, but I couldn't. Because he was always watching. My
          father was a sick fucker. But I still loved him."
        </p>
        <p>"Marino—"</p>
        <p>
          "When Mariana died, I created this little library. I bought every
          single book she had ever wanted to read." I brought the spine of the
          book to my view. "And engraved her name to the spine of these
          hardcovers. I swore to myself that I'd read it all on her behalf." My
          thumb finger grazed the spine before I placed it back on the shelf and
          turned to Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't have time to socialize, to make friends, and talk to real
          people. I'd rather spend every free time reading words Mariana would
          have loved to read. So yes, you have nothing to worry about; I am not
          dying until I read every single thing on this shelf. I will have
          slip-ups. I will make mistakes," I raised my sleeve to my forearm,
          pointing to the bandaged wound. "I'll hurt myself because for me," I
          pressed my palm against my chest. "that's my normal. That's my life
          and the way it is. I'm not spiraling; it's just me. It's normal for
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo looked short for words. "It's not normal to want to hurt
          yourself, Elio. Or to give yourself a death date...or a fucking
          timeline. It's—you need help, at least—get it for the books you might
          not be able to read if you slip, make a mistake, and never come back
          from it."
        </p>
        <p>"That won't happen."</p>
        <p>"It almost did. And if it weren't for me, you'd be dead."</p>
        <p>"It won't happen again,"</p>
        <p>
          "That's what my sister said the first time she attempted it. And it
          happened again, and again, and again until she didn't live to give me
          the same excuse."
        </p>
        <p>I'm not his sister.</p>
        <p>
          "Listen," he said. "I don't want to pretend to know what goes through
          that head of yours. I don't even want to imagine how it must have felt
          to have everyone who's ever heard your name believe you're some
          killer. But I want you to know I understand what it feels like to be
          too late. The guilt. The pain. The grief you can't bring yourself to
          feel. You were too late, and I know how your father twisted the whole
          shit in his favor. But you got to know that none of it was your
          fault."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't need your advice, Angelo. I am not your sister."</p>
        <p>"I know—"</p>
        <p>"I'm not talking about this anymore."</p>
        <p>"You have to come to terms with—"</p>
        <p>"I am done talking about this."</p>
        <p>
          Almost as if the universe listened, Casmiro walked into the room with
          a scowl, shrugging off his jacket and throwing it carelessly on the
          board table. "The amount of money lost today is fucking unforgivable.
          This street people have no control." He said, helping himself to a
          drink at the bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked to the board table, picked up his jacket, and hung it on the
          clothes valet.
        </p>
        <p>"Have you tightened the security?" Angelo asked him.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Those motherfuckers knocked them clean, locked them up, and
          stole from them. They didn't deserve that briefcase."
        </p>
        <p>
          As much as I agreed with him, I couldn't help but say, "She won." I
          walked to the bar area, gesturing for him to pour me a drink.
        </p>
        <p>He got two extra glasses, filling them up for Angelo and me.</p>
        <p>"She fooled me." I picked up the glass and drank.</p>
        <p>Casmiro shook his head. "I don't trust her."</p>
        <p>
          Angelo hummed in agreement. "She's stubborn. I know her kind. Always
          searching for ways to mess with people for their gain." Angelo said.
          "What I don't understand is how she almost killed our Boss."
        </p>
        <p>
          They both watched me, waiting for me to tell them how I had let that
          happen.
        </p>
        <p>I shrug. "She was faster than me."</p>
        <p>
          "She shot you," Angelo said. "Not everyone would have the guts even to
          pick up a gun where you are; talk more of shooting, grazing, and
          punching you in the nose."
        </p>
        <p>I wouldn't lie; it stroked my ego in the wrong way.</p>
        <p>
          My tongue poked at the inside of my mouth. "She's the one we need to
          watch. We know nothing about her, and I have an inkling that the
          little we know is—staged; it's what we're meant to see when we look
          her up."
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro sighed. "They're useful, but they're trouble."</p>
        <p>I twirled the glass in my hand. "We need them."</p>
        <p>
          Angelo nodded in agreement. "They're most definitely going to keep
          surprising us. I wouldn't put it past them to want to try and
          double-cross us. Even though they'd never achieve that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took in a breath. "Here's what we can do. Their security would have
          to be assigned shifts to avoid any familiarity. We keep a close eye on
          them. No cameras. Physical watch only. No one touches any of them. No
          matter what."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We could take one of them. An example to keep the rest in check."
          Casmiro suggested.
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "How do we control them, then? You lost the Chess game, giving them
          the right to return to the casino."
        </p>
        <p>"Let them."</p>
        <p>Casmiro glared. "What exactly do these people have on you, E?"</p>
        <p>"Don't question me."</p>
        <p>"It's hard not to."</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "Is it that you are blind, or you've just decided to
          block your sense of reasoning for the night? Angelo, please explain to
          this inarticulate brother of mine why we can't make an example with
          one of them?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo dropped his glass. "Because they complement each other, hurt
          one, hurt them all."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, what the fuck do we do about them? We can't let their intrusion
          at the Casino go. I have double my task tomorrow thanks to them.
          People were angry; bets were lost. The casino was chaos after they
          left."
        </p>
        <p>"It will be handled."</p>
        <p>"How?"</p>
        <p>"I'll offer them a favor," I told him.</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro groaned. "They do not deserve favors from us; they are common
          criminals, for god sake, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, they are far from being common criminals. They're a team." My
          finger circled the rim of the glass. "And what's the best way to break
          a team?"
        </p>
        <p>They didn't respond, waiting for me to supply the answer.</p>
        <p>
          "You show them how better they could be if they stand alone." I
          watched Casmiro and Angelo let my word settle in, and then I snapped
          my finger. "And just like that, they'd turn on each other, one by one,
          until there's no such thing as STREET."
          <i>Until Devil had no reason to stay.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are we gonna do about the Devil one? He's also clear from the
          system," Casmiro asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Leave him."</p>
        <p>"He attacked you the other day—"</p>
        <p>"Leave. Him."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro eyed me the same way Angelo was looking at me. They were
          curious. They had every right to be. And I should tell them, I should
          tell them about Elia and how important he was to me. I wanted to tell
          them. But I couldn't. Not now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would be risking a lot if I announced it. I'd be risking Elia's
          life, which was not my desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sigh, Casmiro downed his drink. "What about the one that shot
          you? You can't tell me we're doing nothing about that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought the glass to my lips and took a small sip because I was no
          longer in the mood to drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the glass back on the counter, fishing for my pack of
          cigars. When I found it, I took a stick out, placed it between my
          lips, and flicked on my lighter to light the edge of the stick.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "Leave her to me." I brought the stick from my mouth, blowing out the
          smoke. "I'll take care of her." <br /><br /><br />

          The last update for the week,  don't forget to comment on this as you
          read!
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy the update ;)<br /></p>
        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>DEVIL WAS </b>quiet as he helped me redo the stitch on my shoulder.
          His form was tense, his jaw was clenched, and his brows were drawn
          down in a frown. I didn't want to imagine what he was going through.
          Seeing me hurt after his brother had promised he wouldn't hurt me must
          be a reminder that Elio's promises meant nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have loved to relate to his feelings, but blood-relative
          relationships had always been a miss with me. I didn't understand why
          sharing blood with another person meant your loyalties lie with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm okay, you know," I told him as he cut the thread, proceeding to
          get out new bandages.
        </p>
        <p>Devil didn't say anything; he just kept on cleaning me up.</p>
        <p>
          "Everything that happened tonight happened because I let it. You know
          that, right?"
        </p>
        <p>He didn't look at me or respond as he unwrapped the bandage.</p>
        <p>I sighed, placing my palm on his thigh. "Hey,"</p>
        <p>He paused.</p>
        <p>
          <br />"What is it? Talk to me." I said quietly, trying to catch his
          gaze until he succumbed and looked at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He could have killed you," he said. "I can't believe I trusted him
          with you—"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm fine—"</p>
        <p>
          "No, you're not. You have bruises on your wrists. You tore open your
          wound, which he was initially responsible for. He lied. And I—" he
          stopped, letting out a shaky breath.
        </p>
        <p>It was quiet for almost a minute until I broke it.</p>
        <p>
          "You're angry at yourself," I pointed out. "At the fact that you
          believed him when he said he wouldn't hurt me." I wondered if I should
          add or keep the next part to myself. But he looked like he needed to
          talk to someone, and what was the point in hiding the fact that I knew
          they were related? "You're angry that you believed him despite how it
          turned out the last time. How he abandoned you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil flinched, his eyes widening in shock as he watched me. "How did
          you—"
        </p>
        <p>"I figured it out, and he confirmed it to me."</p>
        <p>He blinked at me. "He—he told you we were related?"</p>
        <p>
          "More like I hinted it, and he didn't deny, just leaned into it, like
          there was no point hiding it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil's shoulder relaxed a bit. "Now I know what you meant by
          leverage." He eyed me. "You plan to hold me at gunpoint demanding all
          the money we stole from him?"
        </p>
        <p>"If that's what you want, we can go for it."</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, looking away. "Like he would even care." He
          muttered under his breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, trust me, he would. Everyone thinks Elio Marino is incapable of
          love just because they don't know you exist, but I can assure you, if
          there's anything that man loves more than power and being a fucking
          psychopath and killer, it's you. You come first to him above all
          else."
        </p>
        <p>"And how would you know that?"</p>
        <p>"I saw it."</p>
        <p>
          "You saw wrong. When we spoke the other day, he washed his hands clean
          off me. He told me he would kill me. He said some fucked up shit that
          keeps playing in my head non-stop, and I—I want to hate him, you know?
          I want nothing more but to see him dead for everything he's done, to
          me, to his family, to innocent people who were related to people who
          offended him. I want to see him suffer, but at the same time, I
          don't." he swallowed. "And I don't know if that makes me every bit as
          bad as he is."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No." I scooted closer to him, my fingers diving into his hair as I
          massaged gently. "You're not a bad person. We can't choose our family,
          Devil. We can't choose whom we love, and we shouldn't hate ourselves
          for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "I don't know what to do," he confessed. "Despite
          everything he's done...I still—I still want a relationship with him.
          Because believe it or not, that man leading this whole thing used to
          be the greatest person I know. He was...he was <i>good</i>. Too
          fucking good."
        </p>
        <p>"That's very hard to believe," I admitted.</p>
        <p>
          He chuckled. "I know. When I look at him now, I just—I see a stranger;
          I see someone else, like the person I know, is long since dead, and
          this is just a very wicked ghost of him. But the day we talked, I
          thought I saw a flicker of what he used to be, but I'm not sure after
          tonight."
        </p>
        <p>"But you still want to try?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," he confirmed. "Not for this version of him, no. For the one, I
          remember as a kid. The one who would protect me and tell me how loved
          I was, the one whom I shared dreams with, you know. The one who hid me
          because his fucking dad wanted me dead. Elio, he's—God, he's been
          through so much. I don't even know if he remembers now that he's in
          charge of...everything."
        </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "He was all over the place. Being groomed to become like Ricardo,
          caring for me, his mother, and his siblings. Sometimes he'd come to
          me, beaten and bruised, he never told me how he got them, but I knew
          they were from his father. He never liked to talk about it and the
          things he'd done." Devil looked far away as he spoke. "I remember how
          sunken his eyes always were, dark and tired like—like he never slept.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day I asked him why he always looked like a Zombie, and he said he
          was a zombie because zombies didn't sleep. I remember laughing because
          I didn't really understand. He would smile at me, but it never really
          did reach his eyes, almost like—it took everything in him to move that
          muscle.
        </p>
        <p>
          One night, he rushed in, gave me food, and apologized because he had
          to leave. He said his mother had been sick. It was the first time he'd
          been honest about literally anything that had to do with his family.
          He always talked about them, but only the good parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day when he came by, I asked him if his mother had a cold or
          the flu, and he said he wished that were the case. he looked sad and
          defeated. I hugged him because he looked like he needed it. And then
          he cried. He cried so hard and held me like I was the only thing
          keeping him together. Then he fell asleep for hours. I thought he was
          dead. He looked so...different, peaceful.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the first time I ever saw him cry, and it was also the last.
          At that moment, I badly wanted to protect him from what made him cry.
          I hated it. The tears. It hurt me. I wished he never went back to his
          father. I hoped he stayed with me because—each time he went out and
          came back...something new was always missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each visit, something died. At first, it was his smile, then his
          affection, and then—basically everything."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil let out a breath, looking at me again. "I know it might not be
          worth it, but I want to try. For that boy who cried as I held him, the
          one who needed nothing but company and good sleep." He breathed out a
          small laugh.
        </p>
        <p>"Well fuck." I said.</p>
        <p>"What." He stated in question.</p>
        <p>"I can't kill him now."</p>
        <p>He flicked my forehead, and I scrunched up my nose.</p>
        <p>
          "Like you could hurt a fly." He said, proceeding to finish bandaging
          my shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, like I could," I said</p>
        <p>
          A comfortable silence fell between us until I broke it. "For what it's
          worth, I think he's still there. The brother you once knew."
        </p>
        <p>"How are you sure?"</p>
        <p>"As I said, I saw it."</p>
        <p>
          The banging on the door stopped Devil from responding to that as Dog's
          voice yelled out. "Yo! dumb fucks, round up your fucking; we got to
          count the money!" His footsteps retreated.
        </p>
        <p>I laughed. "I'll kill him one day,"</p>
        <p>
          His hand came to caress my chin, smiling at me. "And I'll hold your
          purse and heels while you do it."
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><b>IT HAD</b> been a week since the Casino incident.</p>
        <p>
          Our security had doubled since then; although they didn't intrude,
          they just watched. I'd been waiting for the other shoe to drop, for
          actions to be taken about the Casino stunt we pulled, but he
          surprisingly left us alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed as though Devil was already leveraged without a gun pointed
          at his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper's gaze flickered to me as I joined the rest of them in the
          living room. He had a whiteboard already littered with information and
          planning, picture stickers, and sticky notes that would aid us in
          visualizing our surroundings before actually going there. A thin
          drumstick was on his left hand, and I didn't even want to ask how he
          got it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Lovely of you to finally grace us with your presence," Upper said,
          looking away as he stood beside the board. At the same time, I found a
          space next to Devil, opposite Milk, whose eyes scanned the board as if
          trying to take it all into memory, and Dog, who divided his attention
          between Upper and the laptop in front of him, our comms right beside
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All right, so we move tomorrow, and the plan is quite simple as we
          have devised over the past couple of days," Upper said, pointing at a
          space in the whiteboard, a miniature van drawing. "This is Dog,"
        </p>
        <p>"The guy in the chair." He muttered, not looking up.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, he'll be our eyes and ears, the mission's omniscient body. The
          van contains three computers showing live feeds from all corners of
          Club Eden."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded in attention.</p>
        <p>
          Upper continued. "The other day Devil and I went there, we installed
          cameras in all wings of the building, tracking devices on anything
          that could be lifted and carried away, and also chips that can enable
          us to listen in on conversations that might aid us, or deliver
          important information we might need."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are the Marinos tracking our activities? Should in case we could snag
          up some info for ourselves?" Milk asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They're tracking everything; Dog might be our guy in the chair, but a
          good number of guys in chairs are backing him up. This is important to
          them." Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>"So, we have no gain at all in this?" She asked again.</p>
        <p>"No," Upper confirmed.</p>
        <p>"Awesome," Milk muttered with a frown.</p>
        <p>"Way forward," I said.</p>
        <p>
          Upper pointed to the club entrance, at two stick drawings with
          spaghetti hair, "This is Milk and Zahra. Your entry is through the
          front. We already obtained VIP tickets so the bouncer would swipe you
          in without questions or the unnecessary ID checking."
        </p>
        <p>"How did we get VIP tickets?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Milk has a brother who's a new bartender in the bar. He's popular,
          handsome, and can sneak in to collect VIP tickets. Illegally."
        </p>
        <p>"And this brother of mine is?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>
          Upper's cane moved to the drawing of what looked like a stick table,
          with a stick person behind it holding a glass. "Devil is your brother;
          although he won't be there when you and Milk walk in, he'd be opening
          the kitchen vent for me, and you'll have another bartender tending to
          you. He's normal people. I think Patrick was his name if I'm correct.
          A man whore for boobs, easily distracted. He's eyed four women who
          have been later called to join Dion, so the odds are in our favor
          there."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And what's that?" Devil pointed to the two stick figures in a corner,
          entering another room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's you and me; I'm leaving the kitchen after drinking too much
          and stealing food. I'm on the verge of throwing up and causing a small
          scene, but you're dragging me out through the back, where people think
          you're going to throw me into a dumpster or something, and if my
          timing is right, it would be about the same time Dion is getting
          distracted by Milk's beauty and charm, to notice the unusual chaos."
        </p>
        <p>"So, there's a back door around the back door?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," Upper's stick trailed from him, and Devil's stick figures to a
          line trailing up what looked like stairs. "Inside the back room, there
          are two doors, one leading outside the club and the other leading
          upstairs to the VIP rooms, it's used as a quick escape route for these
          men in case there's an attack and they can't leave through the
          elevators."
        </p>
        <p>"Got it," Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "So, Devil and I will go up these stairs quietly. Dion bought the
          whole rooms, and most of his boys are stationed there."
        </p>
        <p>"How do you get past them," I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Our guy in the chair." His stick went back to the Van. "There will be
          six guards stationed in front of each door; we would need to get rid
          of them to enter their tech room. So, our guy in the chair is to hack
          their comm devices and tell them that a stranger is coming up the
          elevator unauthorized; it's enough to raise their guard and divert
          their attention to the threat they can see while the coast is clear,
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil waits for me while I find a janitor's closet, get into a vent,
          and head straight to the tech room with a mask to cover my nose from
          the fogless sleeping gas, which lasts about 30 minutes, so we're going
          to have to be quick if we don't want to get seen. When the guards are
          out like a light, I enter the room and unlock the door for Devil, who
          closes it behind him, and it's like nothing ever changed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And in a situation where we exceed 30 minutes in the room?" Devil
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You knock them out before they can open their eyes and realize what's
          happening."
        </p>
        <p>"That sounds like a plan." Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "So," I said, "back to the stranger in the elevator, that's me,
          right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Adequate," Upper said, pointing the drumstick to what looked like an
          elevator with six stick figures pointing guns at it. "They're going to
          see a cute, freckled face, confused woman who looked terrified to see
          six guns pointed at her. Your name will be Fernanda Valez; she was a
          guest there before Dion. Your excuse, you wanted to retrieve a small
          locket you thought you lost weeks ago, and you used the opportunity
          since you were back in town to visit where you stayed last, or some
          shit lie, and then you're probably going to stall by making them
          uncomfortable. You're very good with that."
        </p>
        <p>I rolled my eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Great," Upper said, "Back to Milk and Dion. Milk, you're an essential
          part of this whole thing. Dion always carries his phone with him, and
          his phone holds all his passwords and time counts for access to the
          Pablos server wall of documents, business passes, illegal dealings,
          and everything the Marinos need. We can't exactly ask him to give us
          time access, so you'll be given a device; the moment you get close to
          him, the device automatically gives me access to their servers. You
          might need to keep talking to him until we get all we need."
        </p>
        <p>"Doable." She said.</p>
        <p>
          "Once all that is set, and Devil and I got what we need, we
          communicate through our comms. Zahra rounds up. Milk keeps talking to
          Dion for maybe 30 minutes tops, Devil goes back to bartending, I go to
          Dog at the Van, and Zahra goes back to clubbing. We circle back here
          at 10."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I said, dissecting everything in my head, looking for flaws
          and mistakes. "Milk and I walk in together, right? How is a
          sophisticated guest walking in with a bartender's sister?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You walk in as friends, all giggling and girly stuff. Devil resumed
          work with a duffel bag holding change of clothes for himself, except
          there's one for you too. The duffel bag will be dropped in the third
          stall of the bathroom; the moment Milk is gone, you head there,
          change, and get into character."
        </p>
        <p>"Change from...my usual self or..."</p>
        <p>
          Milk sat up. "Not your usual self; we're going as Valentina and
          Isabella."
        </p>
        <p>"Who the fuck are they?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          Milk smirked. "My personal touch of made-up disguised characters."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "I do not like the sound of that." </p>

        <p>
          Hi! Thank you for being so patient! don't forget to comment on this as
          you read, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this chapter! I missed you
          guys! sdbybfyibfirbf
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy the update ;)<br /></p>
        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>"NO. NEVER</b>. I'm not wearing that." I grimaced, shaking my head
          as if my life depended on it because fucking hell it did. I had agreed
          to the ginger wig, even though we had argued for almost twenty minutes
          over it, but <i>that</i> above mid-thigh red dress she held has got to
          go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's gaze turned very convincing as she stepped closer to me. "To
          show off your legs, Zahra. You have gorgeous legs."
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile was adorable and very fake as I responded, "Thank you, but
          no. You're the one Dion is going to look at, not me. You're the pretty
          girl in the room; therefore, I don't need to put in so much effort."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You do, Z. Don't sell yourself short. Besides, we have to make you
          <i>not</i> look like—you. A complete makeover."
        </p>
        <p>
          I leveled her with a tired look, giving up because I knew she would
          never let me get out of this with a flannel shirt and worn-out jeans.
          "This has always been your dream, hasn't it"
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's smile was languid as it grew on her face. "No, my dream has
          always been to live the Amer—"
        </p>
        <p>"American dream, I get it. Just hurry up."</p>
        <p>
          Milk's eyes lit up with excitement as she touched my cheek. "Now, now,
          Z, we don't rush perfection."
        </p>
        <p>
          We had 5 hours to prepare for the mission. Some of us were supposed to
          be seen, but we could be seen with a convincing disguise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pablo's territory was two states away from the Marino's, and by
          this time of the year, Dion was set to come here for business
          purposes; he had a home here too, but ever since he lost his dog, he
          would spend almost a month at a predetermined hotel, one that was very
          close to a club. We'd found that Dion called it his MVFW (Mini
          vacation from work week).
        </p>
        <p>
          His so-called vacation entailed drowning in his supply of cocaine and
          burying his cock in a willing vagina. It was disgusting, but then
          again, men like him were all disgusting. The things they did in the
          dark, the people they hurt and killed, the women they disrespected—
        </p>
        <p>
          I blocked my mind from going down that lane. This was the problem with
          getting too comfortable and confident to show skin. It took me back to
          times when I couldn't stand the sight of myself in mirrors. I hated
          this, hated that this mission wasn't even something we wanted to do of
          our own free will, and I hated Elio Marino for existing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since that day I shot him, I hadn't seen him. I'd seen Casmiro
          twice and Angelo a lot because we had to keep him in the loop with
          what we had in mind for the Dion mission, and he was there to provide
          us with whatever we needed to plan efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I willed myself to focus on the bigger picture here. Every little
          opportunity to work for the Marino's was another step closer to
          figuring out where exactly to hit them from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would have thought their weak link would be Elio Marino himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          If I held Devil at gunpoint, I wondered what the boss would give to
          take him out of that position.
        </p>
        <p>
          It even sucked more because I couldn't cause more physical damage than
          I had already caused. It would most likely hurt Devil more than it
          hurt Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was so sick because Devil was the only reason Elio and me remained
          completely quiet. He was like a standing block between what could have
          happened if he didn't give a shit about us.
        </p>
        <p>
          An hour later, I was coming out of the dressing room, a frown on my
          caked-up face, as I walked to stand in front of the mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did it fi—holy fucking grail." Milk trailed off, stopping midway from
          the walk-in closet. From her reflection, I could see her eyes widen to
          slits, staring at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The red dress hugged my body, leaving a few teasing bits to the
          imagination. My cleavage was in full display, exposing some of the
          scattered freckles around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, Milk was right...I did have pretty legs. They were scarless,
          perfect like I was a woman who had never seen all she'd seen and
          experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wig fit perfectly with the whole look, and the makeup wasn't too
          extra.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all, I would say I looked...sexy. The only difference between
          <i>that</i> time and now is that I looked sexy for me and not for
          those...fuckers.
        </p>
        <p>"Wow—just wow. I love this—I love you. Marry me now."</p>
        <p>I gave her a strange look in the mirror. "Isn't it too much?"</p>
        <p>
          "Are you kidding?" she rushed to stand behind me, holding my
          shoulders. "You're perfect!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I look like a—person," I said, running my hand down my waist. "Like
          I'm somebody worth knowing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's smile softened as she rested her chin on my shoulder, her hands
          sliding down to my arms. "You always look like that, Zahra. I don't
          know what you've been through because we all left our past behind and
          decided not to talk about it, and it's not like I am dying with
          curiosity to know how you got those scars on your back...I don't wanna
          know or anything...."
        </p>
        <p>I laughed, leaning on her. "Right,"</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled, her eyes twinkling from her reflection as she stroked
          the wig and continued. "But what I know for certain is that the first
          time I saw you, I wanted to know you—to be your friend. To make you
          smile because you never did."
        </p>
        <p>My insides warmed. "You made me smile."</p>
        <p>
          "I did...more like, made you laugh at me...but yeah, same thing." She
          grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
          We stared at our reflection silently before I broke the silence. "I
          love you, Milk," I told her genuinely, my hand covering hers on my
          arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pressed a quick kiss to my cheek. "I love you too, Zahra. Now
          let's go get Dog's reaction."
        </p>
        <p>
          When we reached the living room, Upper and Devil were looking over the
          laptop screen, with Upper pointing and explaining whatever Devil
          needed an explanation for while Dog geared up.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was still early, but Valentina and Isabella were visiting other
          clubs too, so starting the night early was their plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper was the first to notice our presence. His eyes widened, "Bloody
          hell."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil looked up with a frown that slipped off his face as he took me
          in, eyes lingering and sweeping from my feet to my head like he was
          looking at a stranger. "You dressed u—"
        </p>
        <p>
          A sudden burst of laughter from Dog cut him off, followed by a
          somewhat loud click from a camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to Dog with a glare as the photo printed out immediately from
          the camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog shook the picture a few times, laughing his head off. "This is
          fucking gold; I'm framing this."
        </p>
        <p>"Frame it, and I swear to God, you'll be the next person I kill."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, posh...hell knows when I'll ever get to witness this again. I can
          reprint for you guys if you want; we should all have copies of this
          version of Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          I groaned, rushing to attack him, but Devil quickly shot up from the
          couch beside Upper to stand between us. "You can kill him later; if
          you do it now, you might...." there was a twitch in his cheek, almost
          like he was trying so hard not to laugh, and I directed my glare at
          him. "Might...ruin your makeup." He and Dog laughed, high-fiving each
          other at my expense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper chuckled, shaking his head as he closed the laptop. "Folks,
          don't be arseholes, makeups don't get ruined like that. I'm more
          concerned for the nail polish; it's so...so...<i>pretty</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          They all burst out laughing like this was the funniest encounter
          they'd had all week. It was good to see them laugh, but that didn't
          stop me from wanting to shove my heel through their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You all are man-babies, and I worry for your mental health," I
          muttered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk groaned in annoyance. "I hate you guys, come on, Z, let's go."
        </p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes as the boys kept joking around while we prepared for
          the night.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Milk and I stumbled into Club Eden, laughing and chuckling as we had
          just left another club to see what was happening in this one. Acting
          wasn't my strong suit, but it was easy to fall into character with
          Milk by my side. She was a natural, and I could already see eyes
          following our movements as we found our way to the bar, talking about
          things that had never happened to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes that followed us were of different men, and I smiled to
          myself because that was all Milk's doing. She didn't even have to try.
          She didn't have to throw suggestive smiles, she just had to be
          herself, and men would start crawling to her. It was a beneficial
          gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I see you." </i> Dog's voice resounded in our ears, where the
          invisible comm rested.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you see them?" I asked with a grin.</p>
        <p><i>"Yup, on your six. He's getting fucked up." </i>Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "Right how we want him," Milk said as we reached the bar, smiling at
          the bartender. "Hi there," her voice went down a pitch.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Cringe."</i>  Upper's voice filtered through.</p>
        <p>
          Milk kept her gaze on the bartender as she spoke. "Can we get
          something sweet and strong?" She asked the man, who couldn't get his
          eyes off the swell of her cleavage as he nodded wordlessly. "Thank
          you, what's your name?"
        </p>
        <p>"Pat—Patrick. But people call me Pat."</p>
        <p>
          She eyed him with an appreciative look. "Can't wait to taste what you
          mix up for us, Patrick."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Gag," </i>Dog said this time.</p>
        <p>"Y-yes, coming right up."</p>
        <p>
          Her smile widened, but her teeth clamped on her bottom lip, stopping
          the curve of her lips midway, as she turned to me with a wink.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed out a laugh, spotting Devil disappearing into the kitchen
          from the corner of my eyes. "Is it me you're trying to seduce, or
          Pat."
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's gaze settled on my face slowly, her eyes searching mine before
          her attention dropped to my lips. "Could be both," she said, her
          tongue discreetly sliding down her bottom lip as she made eye contact
          again, a slow seductive smile curling at her lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swear my heart skipped a beat, and I forgot how to swallow. All
          amusement of the situation seized, and I was attuned to her. She
          stepped closer to me, and my heart thumped. Anticipating. Her body
          heat kissed mine in a slow caress, and I forgot the mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly her usual smile broke through, and she tapped my cheek,
          chuckling, "Snap out of it; I'm messing with you." she stepped back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I forced out a nervous chuckle. Somehow, she just played with my mind.
          "I'm still convinced your past is made up of you going to some kind of
          off-the-shore women's school where they teach you guys how to seduce
          men...and women."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Like fucking sirens,"</i> Dog said, and I could hear the honk of a
          car and voices at his end.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brows drew down in confusion; why did it seem like he was outside?
        </p>
        <p>"<i>Where the fuck are you, Dog?"</i> Devil beat me to ask.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Went to get some hot dogs...there was this food truck not far from
            me. I couldn't resist the aroma."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"So, who's watching the bloody trailer, filled with computer
            systems showing fucking live feed from a club down the freaking
            street!" </i
          >Upper yelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I locked it, Jesus, calm the fuck down. I didn't go far." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who is watching our backs, you fucking idiot? Go back now." I said
          with gritted teeth, forcing a smile on my face.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Not without that hotdog." </i>Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"I'm gonna fucking kill you if this whole thing goes to shit,"</i>
          Devil said.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Relax, it's my turn to order now—hey beautiful, can I get three
            hot dogs to go, and uh...hmm...let me see...."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, and Milk sighed.</p>
        <p><i>"Hmmm..." </i></p>
        <p><i>"I swear to God, Dog—" </i></p>
        <p><i>"One coke, please, and thank you." </i></p>
        <p>
          There was shuffling in the background, and the person he was talking
          to said, <i>'there you go,'</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"Thanks, sweetheart. Is that Onedirection wristband?"</i></p>
        <p><i>"Yeah,"</i> the person responded, no doubt with a shy smile.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"That's rad; I was a huge fan. I find every Onedirection fan sexy.
            You know, there was a time I thought I could audition and join them
            because people tell me I sound like an angel."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"You don't say," </i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Hm-uhm. In fact, take my card, in case you wanna listen to my
            voice sometime, you can call me."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"Oh, of course...Derek." </i></p>
        <p><i>"Will be waiting to hear from you," </i></p>
        <p>
          We all waited, holding our breaths as we heard some scuffling,
          footsteps, and a few street noises before the sound of a door
          resounded.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Okay, I'm in." </i></p>
        <p>
          I exhaled, and Milk returned to Patrick smiling as he dropped two
          shots before us. She thanked him before returning to me, handing me
          one of the shots.
        </p>
        <p>I threw it down my throat without asking what it was.</p>
        <p>
          It burned, but it was perfect, and I nodded at how fruity it tasted.
          It had a little bit of bitterness, but not too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love this," I said, smiling at Patrick... "Can I get four more of
          this?"
        </p>
        <p>He nodded with a smile my way.</p>
        <p>"What's your stat, Upper?"</p>
        <p><i>"We're in position."</i></p>
        <p>"Dog?" Milk inquired.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Six guards. They're about to leave; give me a sec. Zahra,
            Incoming."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, "Wha—"</p>
        <p>
          A hand snaked around my waist, and I faked a flinch as the person
          whispered in my ear. "My boss wants to have a word."
        </p>
        <p>My frown deepened, and my gaze snapped to Milk's surprised one.</p>
        <p><i>"What the fuck?" </i>Devil cursed surprise in his voice.</p>
        <p>"Your boss? Me?" I asked to be sure.</p>
        <p>"Yes, follow me."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Talk about a change of fucking plans. Zahra, you know what to do,
            Milk; remain in position until I tell you to move," Dog</i
          >
          said, and I suppressed a groan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last thing I wanted to do was to act as the willing vagina for
          Dion's fucking cock. I silently prayed for patience because if that
          motherfucker puts his mouth on me, I'll fucking stab him.
        </p>
        <p>Milk nodded to me, and I followed the man.</p>
        <p><i>"Upper, Devil, you're clear." </i>Dog informed.</p>
        <p><i>"The elevators?"</i> Upper asked.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Zahra can't fuck it up; I need Milk's eyes on her. Leave the
            elevator part to me; I'll handle it." </i
          >Dog said.
        </p>
        <p><i>"What do you mean you'll handle it,"</i> Devil asked.</p>
        <p><i>"Just trust me,"</i></p>
        <p>
          The man led me up some stairs, and I spotted Dion and some of his men.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were seated on a long red curved-edged couch, women around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his salt and pepper hair, Dion sat crossed leg with a crooked
          smile directed at me. I knew he was in his early 50s, but he looked
          very fit, and yeah—very high.
        </p>
        <p>"Come here, doll." He said, tapping his lap.</p>
        <p><i>"I've got eyes on you, do whatever he says." </i>Dog said.</p>
        <p><i>"Okay, Z, I need you close to his phone," </i>Upper said.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Don't see it as a big deal. It's not. He'll touch you, but he
            won't rush. Smile." </i
          >Milk encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a breath, allowing a small, timid smile to slip onto my lips
          as I complied, sitting on his lap.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, you are pretty, like a fine flower."</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Run your fingers through his hair, and thank him." </i>Milk said.
        </p>
        <p>
          My jaw clenched, but I did as instructed, leaning more into him and
          sliding my finger into his oily hair. "Thank you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm," his rough hand squeezed my upper thigh, and I wanted to gag as
          unwanted flashes plagued my mind.
        </p>
        <p>I'm too fucking sober for this.</p>
        <p>
          Almost like the older man heard my thoughts, he brought his stubbled
          face to my neck, nose breathing me in as he pressed a kiss to my
          flesh, "Would you like to loosen up, baby?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Say you're fine." </i>Milk said, but I did the complete opposite.
        </p>
        <p>"Sure, what do you have?"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Stall him; I'm in, and we have just twenty percent left. It slowed
            for some reason, but you can stall him." </i
          >Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, I have magic, baby," Dion said, reaching inside his suit jacket.
          He brought out a small packet of white pills and shuffled out one.
          "Open up."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Don't swallow it," </i>Devil warned.</p>
        <p>I leaned forward, allowing him to put the pill in my mouth.</p>
        <p><i>"Ten percent." </i></p>
        <p>
          Dion pressed rough kisses down my neck, rough stubble scratching my
          skin, while his hand caressed my waist before slipping between my
          thighs. I felt the press of his hard cock on my leg, and my skin
          crawled.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Five percent."</i></p>
        <p>
          I can't do this sober—I can't- his other hand moved to my breast, and
          he squeezed as his tongue licked my neck, sucking on a hickey.
        </p>
        <p>Fuck this.</p>
        <p>I swallowed the pill.<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>WITH TWO</b> bags of late-night greasy food in my left hand, I
          filtered through the bundle of keys on my right, inserting the correct
          one and twisting until I heard a click.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, I looked left and right down the hallway and then at the
          security cameras before pushing the door open, entering the room, and
          kicking the door close behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was at a washed-up motel a few miles out of town, away from
          protection and my last name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time I came here, I thought it would serve as a breath of
          fresh air, but it didn't. The situation didn't baffle me because the
          man sitting on a rocking chair facing the window was Ricardo
          Marino—the former boss of the Marino empire and my father.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You opened the windows again. Were you missing the outside world?" I
          asked, shrugging off my suit jacket before dumping the keys on the
          single small shelf by the side of the door.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't respond.</p>
        <p>
          I kicked off my shoes, stretching my neck from left to right before
          walking to stand beside him. The wind that blew in from the netted
          window was chilling, and it made me let out a breath. "I see why. It's
          peaceful out there."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." He muttered.</p>
        <p>
          I moved to sit at the window sill, outstretching one of the food bags
          to him, which he eagerly collected. "Slow down; you haven't eaten in a
          day; I can't afford you choking yourself to death—as much as I'd love
          to see it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking out the cheap burger I had gotten for myself; I studied the
          starved man in front of me. His pale skin, chapped lips, and
          red-rimmed eyes. He looked so much older than his age. The wrinkles on
          his face and the sagging of his skin had worsened. He looked like a
          dead man with life. It was irritating, but it pleased me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite my warning about him rushing his food, he still gobbled it,
          and I shook my head at him, watching with pity as I took a bite from
          my burger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had stopped threatening me years ago, stopped glaring at me, and
          contained his snide remarks about how much of a mentally ill person I
          was compared to my mother. He had stopped cursing at me too. Now he
          just complied. Knowing if he didn't misbehave, I might come sooner
          than expected, with food and my company.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I swallowed, I let my tongue run over my bottom lip. "Not long
          now, father. Everything is coming to plan. It would have been sooner,
          but there was a bit of a holdup."
        </p>
        <p>Dread smeared his face, and a whimper escaped him.</p>
        <p>
          "I know, it's infuriating," I said with a sigh of distress. "Elia
          showed up with this band of thieves."
        </p>
        <p>My father's eyes widened a little.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "Right? The foolish boy has been in Italy for years,
          committing petty crimes just for the fun of it. I wouldn't say he did
          it because he was hungry and needed the money." I took another bite
          from the burger, chewing and swallowing before speaking again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All the legal funds of the Marino empire will be going to his name. I
          had his entire life planned for him. He was settled, and all that
          remained was Casmiro and Angelo because they had worked so hard to be
          left with nothing. But then—Elia showed up; I can't burn it all with
          him in it. It makes all these years of planning useless."
        </p>
        <p>
          My father whined. It was scratchy and irritating to hear when he
          spoke. "Just—kill me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Have you heard a word I've been saying, old man? I can't do
          it yet—I kill you, and I kill me too, and I can't die until I am sure
          everyone else won't be affected by it. I need to make sure Elia is
          happy and away—far, far, away from Italy. When that is done, you and
          I, we're going to have a lot of fun." I told him, taking another bite
          from the unhealthy burger in my grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You—you need help, Elio—please get help." He said, his eyes drained
          as he looked at me with pity, shaking his head slowly like he actually
          cared.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I swallowed the chunk, I had taken a bite off; My head provided
          me the mental image of me wrapping my hands around his throat,
          squeezing until I killed his body and his fucking soul because it
          didn't deserve to be judged, it deserved to rot as his flesh would.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of putting my thoughts into action, I nodded. "You should have
          told my mother to get help. She needed it more. Who knows, we wouldn't
          be here, and you wouldn't have to watch everything our predecessors
          have worked so hard for—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kill me, boy." He jerked from the rocking chair. "I don't want to see
          it—I refuse to see you destroy my name—our legacy—just kill me and be
          done with it, isn't that what you want?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped my half-eaten burger, observing him, before taking my eyes
          away and looking out the netted windows, seeing the light droplets of
          rain showering down and the cars swooshing by, headlights shining and
          dimming as the cars swept by.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't even know me," I said, but it was so low I barely heard
          myself. "You did this to me, and you don't even know me. That's not
          fair. I'm fucked up because of you, and you still don't know what I
          want."
        </p>
        <p>Silence stretched, and I swallowed.</p>
        <p>
          Since I took over Marino from him, I'd worked my head off to bring our
          name to insanely incredible heights. We were legal; we were in the
          political spotlight. We were gigantic, made for life. The family's
          inner business ran smoothly. No complications and no hiccups.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't just want to kill you, father. I want to make you suffer. I
          want to drive you mad, and I want to see you weep when you watch it
          all burn. You're so lucky because I'll be standing by your side,
          holding your hand. At least you'll have me as a company. The sinner
          you created. The best fucking poetic justice. Mother would be proud of
          me."
        </p>
        <p>He closed his eyes, whimpering.</p>
        <p>I looked back at him. "Would you be proud of me?"</p>
        <p>
          He opened his eyes, offering me a blank look; now tired of me, I was
          guessing. I sighed. "You're no fun these days. You tire too quickly.
          Are you ill?"
        </p>
        <p>He kept quiet.</p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "Speak, or the next time you'd see me will be weeks from
          this one."
        </p>
        <p>He sighed. "What—do you want me to—say?"</p>
        <p>"Tell me you're proud of me."</p>
        <p>
          Silence stretched, and his eyes filled with pity and something else I
          refused to cling to. "I am proud of you," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed, holding my head high as relief flooded through me. "Thank
          you, Papà."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked out the window again, picked up my burger, and shoved it into
          the brown bag to throw away later. "This gang Elia brought about will
          allow me to cover more ground. First, I want to start with Pablo. He
          holds big grudges. They will attack us. Run down a few of our
          operations based on the leak I will give. Our capos would probably
          think it is an act of war from the Pablos. They will want to
          retaliate, and it will bring about chaos. I can't wait to revel in
          it."
        </p>
        <p>
          My father shook his head. "You can't ruin decades of alignment with
          the Pablos, Elio. Y—you can't do this to the family."
        </p>
        <p>
          His face was tight, and it was the look he gave whenever he wanted to
          speak to me in Italian, but he had long since learned his lesson. The
          first time he did it, I cut him; the second time, I stabbed him; and
          the third, I beat him up. The fourth time, I registered that touching
          the man only gave me anxiety, so I stopped and decided to starve him
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, he has only used English.</p>
        <p>
          "I can do it to the family. I want to do it. I crave destruction. I
          crave to see the look on your face when it happens. The one thing—the
          <i>only</i> thing you have ever cared about, falling to pieces all
          around you. Ah...the bliss that would bring."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just kill me." the man whimpered again, looking on the verge of
          tears, and I wanted to smile. I so badly wanted my lips to curve up in
          a smile, but that invisible force kept my lips firm, denying me that
          relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          It reminded me that though I had control over my father, his actions
          in the past still had complete control over my mind; there was still
          an inkling of fear when I looked at his face, a small piece of want
          for his approval in everything I did.
        </p>
        <p>It only fueled my determination to finish what I had started.</p>
        <p>And I would...soon.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Angelo approached me at the gazebo just by the poolside; his stance
          held a straight form that told me I was about to be given bad news. I
          refilled my whisky glass, taking my eyes off him as I dropped the
          bottle on the small table that held three lit scented candles, my
          cigar box and lighter, and a book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last thing I needed was any sort of disturbance. I took my
          <i>me</i> time very seriously, and Angelo might just be at the
          receiving end of however my response would come out. Depending on
          whatever it was, he wanted to tell me.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey. Looked for you earlier. Where did you go?"</p>
        <p>
          "Monitoring my movements now?" I asked him, taking out a cigar and
          lighting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You left the compound without security." He stated displeasure in his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a long drag from the cigar, blowing it out with the stick
          resting between my fingers as I picked up the whiskey glass with the
          same hand and picked up my book with the other before allowing my gaze
          to settle on him. "And what business do you have with that? Hm? Can't
          I leave my own home without soldiers tailing me like flies to shit?"
        </p>
        <p>"Where did you go?" he asked, eying me suspiciously.</p>
        <p>
          I gave him a look of surprise. "Where did I—" I paused, shaking my
          head. "I went to a motel to see my dead father; what else would you
          like to know? The food I ate on the way? Greasy, unhealthy burger.
          Would you like to know if I stopped by the side of the road to piss
          and refuel my car?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo sighed, clearly not believing a word I said. Elio Marino would
          never eat greasy roadside food. He would never be as foolish to drive
          alone; he would never stop by a shady gas station to refuel his car;
          there was no way he could see his father because Ricardo Marino had
          been dead for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am only asking because you shouldn't just leave like that—at least
          let someone know your whereabouts, and it's not a must you have
          soldiers tailing you; they can stand back and only come to you when
          you need help." Angelo sighed. "Also, if you would just get a fucking
          phone, so maybe I can call next time you choose to disappear."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>He cursed under his breath. "You need a phone—"</p>
        <p>"No. I carry too much with me. There is no space for a phone."</p>
        <p>"Marino—"</p>
        <p>
          I furrowed my brows in mock confusion. "I feel like I'm being
          repetitive. I feel this sense of déjà vu—like—like we have had this
          conversation before, and my response was exactly the same as the one
          I'm giving you. Do you feel it too?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo dropped his head, a small chuckle leaving him. "No phone...got
          it."
        </p>
        <p>"Excellent. Anything else?"</p>
        <p>
          He stood straighter. "Yes," He cleared his throat. "STREET returned
          from the mission an hour ago."
        </p>
        <p>"Indeed? Wait, that was today?"</p>
        <p>"Yes," Angelo answered, his features suddenly tight.</p>
        <p>
          "I take it we have what we need, then," I stated in question, taking a
          sip from the glass before dropping it back on the table, losing
          interest.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, we do."</p>
        <p>I raised a brow. "But..." I inquired.</p>
        <p>
          "There was a little deviation from their original plan, and they—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who died?" I asked, hoping it seemed I cared as I took a lung full of
          the smoke, leaving it in my body for a few seconds before letting it
          out. "One of the STREET people?"
        </p>
        <p>"No," Angelo said.</p>
        <p>"One of Dion's people?"</p>
        <p>
          Angelo cleared his throat again. "No. Dion Juan Pablo is the one
          who's...dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused and frowned, and my gaze sharpened on him. "I beg your
          pardon?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "She said it was a form of self-defense, he tried to rape her, so she
          protected herself."
        </p>
        <p>"Which girl? The pretty one with the beverage name?"</p>
        <p>Angelo shook his head.</p>
        <p>
          I raised both my brows, nodding. "Ah, the short one." I mused aloud
          and sat up, dropping my book and pressing the cigar into the ashtray.
          "Finally..."
        </p>
        <p>"Nobody knows they did it."</p>
        <p>
          "It doesn't matter. Their mission was to steal. Not to kill. There is
          no excuse for carelessness. Have her brought here."
        </p>
        <p>"Marino, she was almost abused—"</p>
        <p>"Have her brought to me. Where is Casmiro?"</p>
        <p>
          "Handling it. Pablo himself will be seeking answers. Casmiro is making
          sure those answers don't lead back to us."
        </p>
        <p>It will. Unfortunately.</p>
        <p>
          "If it does lead back to us. A betrayal of this kind is unforgivable.
          This will most definitely give me a decent amount of inconvenience.
          Somebody has to pay for it."
        </p>
        <p>"She was a victim."</p>
        <p>
          "I was a victim; you were a victim. Did the world go easy on us? No.
          They lack discipline. She, in particular, needs a reality check. I am
          happy to deliver it."
        </p>
        <p>"Dion was—"</p>
        <p>
          "Have some soldiers bring her here, Do not let other members
          interrupt. Especially Devil. And tell Casmiro to meet me at my home
          lounge in an hour." I said, getting my gun and checking the bullet
          casing, before swiftly cocking the weapon and flicking back on the
          safety.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you plan to do?" Angelo asked, eying the gun in my hand.</p>
        <p>
          My thumb rubbed against the surface of the gun as I responded. "Kill a
          sinner and everyone they share blood with. It has been a while."

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>I WASN'T </b>born like the other kids were.</p>
        <p>
          At least, I thought I was until I realized the things happening to me
          didn't happen to normal kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          From age 5-12, I lived with two adults—no, it wasn't foster care; it
          was worse than that. From the little I remember, and from what I know
          now, the gruesome things they made me and the other children staying
          with us do, were not something children should have been doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it made them money; older men and younger men alike would pay
          thousands of dollars to have their way with us...no penetration, just
          gratification, terrible, terrible things we had to do with our hands
          and mouths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anytime I close my eyes, and force myself to remember, I could still
          see that little girl, standing beside her handler, dreading to ask him
          that budding question...

            worn out, the lights always dim, like they needed change, but I was
            little, if I pointed any of these things out, they would never
            listen to me, so like always, I kept quiet and asked Mr. Handler

            day I might start to like it</i

            brothers and sisters. Sometimes, when all our visitors were gone,
            they would buy us ice cream and candies, and we would watch

          laughing and chuckling like I was on the brink of madness. Dion was
          also chuckling too, high on whatever he had given me.

          telling us to go somewhere private.

        <p>
          I was dazed with everything around me, and when the elevator closed,
          Dion held my face in his hands and crashed his lips to mine in a kiss,
          pulling my waist to the bulge in his pants; I giggled when he dropped
          his head to lick and kiss my neck.

          The elevator dinged open, Dion led me out, and we stumbled down the
          hallway. One of the guards in front of a door opened it for us, and
          Dion led me inside, closing the door behind me as he pushed me to it,
          his body pressing against mine, erection hard against my stomach while
          he kissed me.

          My hand went to undo the zipper of my dress, and then I slipped it
          down my body, leaving the red lace panties and bra on display.

          "Do you have a knife?" I asked him, and he frowned, still stroking his

          "Top drawer to the left," Dion said like a happy dog waiting to be fed
          by his master.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved to the drawer he gestured to and smiled to myself, spotting
          the knife there. It was small and handy. Just perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made my way back to the foot of the bed before I climbed on slowly,
          crawling up his naked body and pressing myself down to his hard cock.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," he grunted, his jaw clenching. He rocked his hips, trying to dry
          hump me through my red lace panties.
        </p>
        <p>"Shhh, patience."</p>
        <p>"Ride me—fuck—I'm so hard right now."</p>
        <p>
          "Poor thing, you wanna see something interesting before we start?"
        </p>
        <p>He nodded hurriedly.</p>
        <p>
          I raised my knife-free hand to the wig and pulled it off with the
          small wig cap I wore underneath it, whipping my short hair left and
          right, my fingers brushing through the small waves of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt Dion's cock soften almost immediately, looking at me with wide
          eyes, the recognition shining like a bright light in those dimmed,
          intoxicated pupils.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh fuck..." he muttered in defeat.</p>
        <p>"You recognize me?"</p>
        <p>Fear flashed through those eyes, and I smiled.</p>
        <p>
          "Of course you do, Juan," I said, dragging the knife down to his chin
          from his cheek. "What?" I shot him a taunting smile, "You don't wanna
          fuck me anymore?"
        </p>
        <p>His chest heaved.</p>
        <p>"Look, Zahra, I paid off Martino; I have nothing owed to you."</p>
        <p>"You don't?"</p>
        <p>"Just let me go; if you kill me, Pablo will—"</p>
        <p>
          "Do nothing; you know he'll do nothing, Juan. Even if he wanted to,
          Martino or I would be the last person he thinks of."
        </p>
        <p>"What do you want from me?"</p>
        <p>
          "Your life." I smiled. "Remember the last time we saw each other? I
          told you I would dig a knife down your throat." I dragged the knife to
          his throat. "What was it you called me? Martino's whore?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Martino cut off my fucking finger for that, isn't that payment
          enough?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "How about the little girl you killed? Isa. You fucked her—raped her,
          and killed her. This was before the incident with Martino. Do you
          remember? Your words were, 'throw her body in a fucking river
          somewhere; she didn't even make me <i>come</i>' She was a
          <i>fucking</i> child."
        </p>
        <p>"That was—"</p>
        <p>
          I raised the knife and plunged it right into the base of his throat. I
          gritted my teeth, twisting the knife as I felt his leg kick weakly
          behind me, eyes wide in death as he choked in the gurgle of his blood,
          his bloodied tongue sticking out as all his green veins rose to supply
          blood to the spot I had stabbed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I twisted the knife again, watching his life slip out of him until his
          struggle stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heaved a sharp breath, letting go of the weapon as I threw my head
          back, and pressed my eyes tightly together. "Shit," I gritted out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly I got off him, rushed to the bathroom, and washed the blood
          from my hands. I ran back into the room, picked up my dress, and
          slipped it back on before finding the small cap and the wig, arranging
          them on my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door pushed open brutally, and I gasped, turning to see a
          fast-breathing Devil. "Zah—" he stopped short as his gaze shifted to
          Dion's body on the bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          His wide eyes shifted to me and then to Dion; he rushed into the room,
          and before he shut the door, I spotted unconscious bodies on the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck happened?" he whispered in a yell, raking both hands
          through his hair. "How the—why the—"
        </p>
        <p>
          My body shook, and I hugged myself, "He tried to hurt me, I—I was
          trying to defend myself, and I—I don't know what happened—I was—I was
          wasted—I wasn't thinking—I didn't know—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, hey," Devil rushed to me, wrapping his hands around my body.
          "I'm sorry, it's okay; I'm glad you're okay. Fast thinking is always
          important." He assured, breaking away from me before rushing to Dion's
          body and pulling the knife from his throat. "We gotta get outta here."
          He said.
        </p>
        <p>He held my wrist. "Come on."</p>
        <p>
          Before we left, I picked the ruined comm device from the ground and
          glanced at Dion's lifeless body.
        </p>
        <p>My lips curved to the side. <br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>ONE MORE</b>, just one more pretense act, and I could carry on with
          my day and self-reflect on my actions. No matter how many times I'd
          done it, there was still that hollow feeling that came after taking a
          life—the feeling of emptiness and wrongness.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were terrible men; they deserved it because they hurt a lot of
          people. But who am I to pass judgment upon them? There was no way to
          regain the little pieces of myself and the conscience that I lost
          after I ended a life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing keeping my head in check was the awareness of right,
          wrong, necessity, and the limit to how far I took my revenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martino would say there was a lever in every human, one you should
          always pull when you feel like you're drowning in the emotion that
          comes with getting justice for the wrongs committed against you. If
          you didn't pull the lever, you'd sooner forget where it is in your
          mind, and you'd be no different from the people you want dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried not to forget that. Each time I took a life, I'd take a moment
          to myself, try to pull myself back from that dark place, and come back
          like nothing had ever pulled me there in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head was still light from the pill Dion gave me. I'd recognized it
          on sight and knew I wouldn't get completely out of it with just one. I
          would have needed at least three for a total blackout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two soldiers ordered to bring me to the poolside maintained their
          distance after I'd urged them to touch me and see what happened. I
          already knew it was a matter of time before the boss himself asked for
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before then, I had been with STREET, and they'd been threading
          carefully because they thought that was the first time I ended a life.
          Meanwhile, I didn't feel like talking because the pill made me feel
          sick and hung over despite not making me so high that I lost all my
          senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I maintained the frown on my face as we reached the poolside, ignoring
          the dull ache at the side of my head as I spotted two more soldiers
          standing by the gazebo, and the two that had brought me retreated to
          stand at a near end.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted to Elio, who stood at the foot of the pool, both hands
          tucked into his pants, his suit and tie nowhere in sight. And, as
          always, he looked like someone dressed for a funeral.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, walking towards him, wishing I had changed into something
          else. This dress had overstayed its welcome.
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully, this will be quick.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't look away from the pool as I stood beside him. "Thinking of
          taking a dip?" I asked, "Because I could totally sleep off tonight's
          chaos and leave you to it." I said, hugging myself.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't respond.</p>
        <p>
          The silence toyed with my head, and I shifted from one foot to
          another, the cold outside sending chills down my spine.
        </p>
        <p>Impatient, I opened my mouth to speak, but he beat me to it.</p>
        <p>
          "I can't remember the last time I swam." He said, still looking at the
          large pool, voice raspy. "It's been...years. I think I was still a
          teenager then." He breathed in and then out. "I feel this little
          twinge of fear whenever I see this pool. But for some reason, I can't
          stay away."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at the pool and then at him. "I really don't give a fuck
          about anything you've just said."
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned his head in my direction and looked away. After a few
          seconds, his whole form went still, a frown caused a slight pinch to
          his brows, and then he looked back at me again.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was like a confused, delayed double-take. I watched his eyes scan
          me from head to toe and then slowly back to my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed the wig because I couldn't stand the heat it gave my head
          and neck. I wonder how people do it, honestly.
        </p>
        <p>"What in the world are you wearing." He stated in question.</p>
        <p>
          I looked down at myself with a frown and then met his gaze blankly.
          "Do you not recognize it because it's in a different color? It's a
          dress, Elio. Like...a cloth? People wear clothes to cover their
          nakedness? Cause it's clothes?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know what—" he stopped, blinking and shaking his head as if to say,
          not today. "My reason for asking for you—"
        </p>
        <p>"Finally, let's get this over with."</p>
        <p>
          His jaw locked. "Angelo told me you deviated from tonight's original
          plan by killing Dion Juan Pablo. He says it's because he almost abused
          you."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "Indeed? You don't look too shaken up for a person who was almost
          sexually assaulted."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, holding myself tighter, my nails digging into my arm. "Dion
          tried to rape me, and I defended myself. I didn't mean to kill him,
          but I guess the knife touched the wrong vein because my good luck
          sometimes is a curse," my voice shook, and I felt tears rising like
          bile in my throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed out, trying to hold myself together and hold the tears
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood straighter, struggling to get a hold of my emotions, and I
          continued. "I couldn't exactly push him off me because he was twice my
          size. So, I did the next best thing I could do. I didn't think—think
          that he would...die."
        </p>
        <p>Elio's brows drew down in a frown.</p>
        <p>
          "My whole team is worried about me, and I fucking hate it when people
          walk around me like I'm an eggshell they don't want to crack." I let
          out a humorless chuckle, looking away from him. "As much as they don't
          like to admit it, they look up to me. I'm not about to make them see
          me as some weakling."
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back at him, I hardened my features even though I could feel
          the tears building up in my eyes. "I am shaken up, but I am also angry
          because I just <i>killed</i> a <i>person</i>, and the last thing I
          want to do right after is talk to the man who sent us on the goddamn
          mission in the first place. I just need to get under the damn covers
          and wait for the nightmares I can already feel coming; so sorry if I'm
          not a fucking weeping woman, but you don't expect me to cry amid my
          enemies." I said in one breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio watched me, his eyes assessing and the frown leaving his face
          before he spoke, "Why do you even try?"
        </p>
        <p>That stopped my thoughts for a bit, but I didn't break.</p>
        <p>"What?" I feigned confusion and disbelief.</p>
        <p>
          "That...was a pathetic attempt at lying. It's the worst you've come up
          with for as long as I've known you."
        </p>
        <p>"You think...you think I'm—"</p>
        <p>"Enough, I see right through it."</p>
        <p>
          I kept the act on for precisely five seconds before I drew on a blank
          look. "He got what he deserved," I said at last. "He wasn't a good
          person."
        </p>
        <p>"So, killing him makes you better?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "I will ignore your delusion and return your attention to what I
          wanted from this. It wasn't to kill him, but to get access to their
          system—"
        </p>
        <p>"Which we did."</p>
        <p>"You do not cut me off when I'm talking, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          I had another smart-ass reply right off my tongue, but I held myself
          back, and he continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not only were you reckless, but you also put the lives of your
          companions at risk; you put the life of my only family at risk. And
          that is something I can't forgive."
        </p>
        <p>"Devil is alive, and everyone else is fine."</p>
        <p>"It doesn't answer the what-if question."</p>
        <p>
          "There doesn't have to be a what-if question. Dion was a fucking
          bastard. I had a score to pick with. I saw an opportunity to pick that
          score, and I did. No one was hurt, and no one knew it was us. The
          world is still turning."
        </p>
        <p>"¿Qué puntaje?" He asked. <i>What score?</i></p>
        <p>
          "Eso es para que yo lo sepa, y para que usted se ocupe de sus
          asuntos."
          <i>That is for me to know and for you to mind your business.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          He went quiet and turned away from me, facing the pool. "You have no
          remorse or regret for what you've done."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't see a reason to."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, and I hated that I couldn't read him right now. Somehow, I
          had been the open book tonight; he wasn't giving anything away.
        </p>
        <p>I took a step back from him just to be safe.</p>
        <p>
          His throat worked. "My father used to drown me...here, right in this
          pool." He said, and I frowned, my eyes going to the lonely water
          before settling back on him. His eyes were trained on the water like
          he could see it happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took his hand out of his pocket and pointed to the gazebo. "Right
          over there is where my mother used to stand, watching him drown me."
          he dropped his hand back down. "I personally think she loved to
          watch."
        </p>
        <p>
          I held myself tighter for real this time. Remembering all Devil had
          told me weeks ago. "Why?" I asked. "Why did your father do that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I was stubborn. I lied a lot. Kept things from him. Spoke
          English to him. Forgot something he told me I shouldn't forget. Did
          something other than what he wanted." He said, taking his second hand
          out of his pocket as he began to undo his cufflinks slowly. "He called
          it baptism. Whenever I did any of those things, he would call me a
          sinner and bring me here. And I would beg him, pathetically. Thinking
          maybe this time he'd listen; he'd show mercy and let me off with just
          a warning. But he never did." He slipped the first cufflink into his
          pocket, proceeding to undo the second one. "I would shout, but then,
          he'd dip my head inside the water, cutting me off; I would fight, but
          he wouldn't let me go; I'd run out of air, and he would keep his hold
          firm. He did it until I would drown, and then, he'd pump my chest
          until I woke up." He slid the second cufflinks inside his second
          pocket and began rolling up his sleeves.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When he wasn't satisfied with the lesson, he'd do it again. The
          feeling of fear—of dying—the number of times he made me feel it, had
          me defying him at every turn. Just so he would bring me here and do it
          again. Just so I could revel in the dazed look my mother would give
          us. Just so I could imagine what it would feel like to just—watch."
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned to me when he finished rolling up his sleeves. "But more
          than anything, I wanted to know how it felt to be the one doing the
          drowning. I wanted to be the one pushing my head under the water. I
          didn't know why at that time, but now I do."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because you're a sick fucker who needs serious medical attention?"
        </p>
        <p>"Part of the reasons."</p>
        <p>I took another step back, and he took one forward.</p>
        <p>
          "The real reason was the relief of knowing that I would lose
          consciousness. I found that the better version of myself is when I
          can't be myself. When I get to escape, even for a few minutes. I still
          thank my father for giving me that awareness."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>"What did your mother do afterward?"</p>
        <p>
          "She took care of me. And waited eagerly for the next time we'd take
          another visit to the pool, and soon I started waiting eagerly with
          her."
        </p>
        <p>"That's fucked up."</p>
        <p>"She was sick. It's hard to blame her."</p>
        <p>"So, it's genetic," I said, stepping back.</p>
        <p>"As I have suspected, yes."</p>
        <p>"Why are you telling me all this?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because you're a sinner, like me." He stepped toward me, and I took
          two back. "In clearer words, Zahra, because you're about to die."
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood still, and it felt like everything paused around us for a
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We watched each other, and he waited for me to make the first move. It
          was bait. But it meant two things, I either fall for the bait and
          survive to see another day or put up a fight and die by his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose the first option, turned, and bolted down the curved corner of
          the pool. I should have known there was a problem when the guards
          didn't make a move to even stop me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running from him was stupid, a guaranteed failure, but I still
          attempted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached the only exit door and tried to open it, but it didn't
          budge.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."</p>
        <p>
          I looked behind me to see him walking toward me like he had all the
          time in the world, calm and collected. "No cameras, no rules, no
          helper...it's just you and me now, Sport."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around me. This was an open area, which was well-fenced with
          bushes around. There was a building there, but the only way to enter
          it was through the exit doors and the window.
        </p>
        <p>I rushed to the window and tried to pull it up.</p>
        <p>"Locked," Elio's taunting voice reached my ear again.</p>
        <p>
          It was made of glass; if I could punch a hole through and reach the
          lock—
        </p>
        <p>"You can't break it." His voice rang out as if he was in my head.</p>
        <p>I swallowed, feeling sweat bead on my forehead.</p>
        <p>The fence.</p>
        <p>
          "It's useless. I'm taller than you are, and even I won't be able to
          make the jump." His voice was closer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned sharply, and he was closing in on me as I had guessed. I
          moved to run again, but I didn't go far. He caught me just at the
          pool's edge; I tried to squirm out of his hold. My elbows pushed but
          failed mercilessly to make a hit to his stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped my head to sink my teeth into the skin on his forearm and
          reveled in the bliss that came from his groan of pain. I dipped my
          teeth further until I tasted blood. He forcefully pulled his hand from
          my mouth, and his grip loosened.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I thought I had the running opportunity, his leg swept mine from
          underneath me, and I fell toward the pool. On reflex, I grabbed his
          shirt collar as I went down, and we both hit the water with a massive
          Splash.
        </p>
        <p>
          For about five seconds, I was underwater, but I waved my arms and legs
          furiously until my head was above again; I coughed out, my chest
          heaving as my breathing pushed out in gasps.
        </p>
        <p>
          We fell on the deepest side of the pool, and fucking hell was It
          deeper than any pool I'd ever been in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio Surfaced right after me, his hair wet and pressed against his
          forehead as he angrily brushed it away, gaze furious and dead set on
          me, keeping himself afloat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't want to do this," I said with trembling lips, shivering
          from the cold water.
        </p>
        <p>
          He swarm towards me, and my attempt to swim back was a total failure.
          I tried to fight him off again, trying to move my legs to hit him, but
          I was too slow, and somehow, he was faster, like he had mastered the
          act of moving stealthily underwater. I moved to hit him with my hand
          in the open air, but he caught it, his other hand wrapping around my
          neck.
        </p>
        <p>"You—you really don't want to do this." I stuttered in a shiver.</p>
        <p>
          "Why?" He seethed out, not even shivering as violently as I was, but I
          could see the goosebumps on his forearm as his grip tightened around
          my neck, almost cutting my airflow.
        </p>
        <p>My last resort was my leverage.</p>
        <p>"Devil—he'll never forgive you."</p>
        <p>
          He blinked at me, amusement shining in his eyes as he said.
          "Surprise...that's exactly why I'm doing this."
        </p>
        <p>Fuck.</p>
        <p>
          "You piece of shi—" my words were swallowed the moment the water
          swallowed my head and my entire body.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I wondered how long I could hold my breath. <br /><br /><br />

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>IT WAS </b>simple.</p>
        <p>
          I needed STREET. They were skillful. Stringent. Chaotic in the face of
          danger, but still conceivably effective. But I had never been one to
          rely on people before making my next move. I was beginning to lean on
          the idea of them, beginning to get perturbingly dependent on their
          presence to get things done.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was the fact that I wanted Elia far away from me, from this
          country, but the lingering sense of peace seemed to fill me, knowing
          he was close by. The urge to keep him safe and shield him from danger
          was like a bow to a violin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia being close by, was messing with things. And him being close to a
          person who attracted danger like a moth to a flame was even worse than
          him being closer to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know who she was. But I knew she was someone. Someone who had
          the guts to kill the second in command of a pernicious family and show
          no remorse or fear for it.
        </p>
        <p>It was direful.</p>
        <p>
          All my years in this business, I had seen fear. I had looked into the
          eyes of men twice my age, withering in fear after a betrayal they
          thought could take me out of power. I had seen fear in the eyes of
          powerful men after taking the life of someone they weren't supposed to
          touch, but somehow, that fear had been missing from her eyes. It made
          her lie very transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It put me on guard. And for something to put me on guard, it simply
          meant it was a symptomatic sign that I had to cut her off. she was a
          threat. A threat to my presence, a threat to my brother's life, and
          eventually, a danger to my insanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I detested her formidable presence; I abhorred her negative effect on
          me. I despised that she even affected me, that she played the strings
          of my anger until I resulted in a mentally scarring solution to get
          rid of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never used this pool. Never liked it. It was a trigger, one that bit
          at my skin and toyed with my head. A vast mass of water scared me. I
          only used a bathtub to punish myself; otherwise, the shower was the
          only place I could bear the thought of being underwater. It was where
          my mom would take me after my father was done with me. She would wash
          me, sing to me, brush my hair in the privacy of my bedroom, and feed
          me till I couldn't breathe. It was her idea of an apology, but she
          didn't know how much I appreciated it. How much I reveled in the care
          that came after each punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been years since I had dwelled in these taunting memories. And
          now, all because of this—
        </p>
        <p>
          My grip tightened around her neck, and though it was numb, I still
          felt the sting of her nails clawing at my fingers, trying to set
          herself free while she held her breath, her body already giving out to
          the pull of the water and the lack of oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she dies, Devil has no reason to stay here. He'll try to kill me,
          but he'll fail. I'll hold him hostage and transport his ass back to
          Los Angeles with tighter security this time. I either let the rest of
          the chaotic crew go or kill them, depending on my mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          After everything happens the way I will, I'd handle things myself, my
          plan goes back into motion, and everything goes back to normal.
        </p>
        <p>No STREET. No Devil. No hiccups in my path.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra's hand moved to my wrist, trying with all her weak might to get
          my grip to loosen. Her face was scrunched on tight, trying to hold her
          breath and survive. The sheer determination she gave off was
          impressive. She'd been trained for this too. It was painfully obvious
          how long she had lasted, but I knew she was at her breaking point, and
          this was beginning to get tiresome.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tightened my grip, and her eyes widened underneath the water, her
          mouth finally slipping open, taking in the water to her lungs. Her
          body jerked in my hand, but I held firm.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There we go," I whispered while her body gave another vibrating jerk.
          "Don't fight it."
        </p>
        <p>
          The bubbles slowly stopped, her body jerked again, her grip loosening
          from my wrist when she gave out to the water, and her eyes flickered
          shut until there was nothing. No sound of struggling or rippling
          water; it was just silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heaved a breath and pulled her body out of the water, signaling to
          one of the soldiers, and he rushed towards me. I grunted, lifting her
          heavy unconscious body from the pool, the soldier assisting in pulling
          her out completely, laying her body beside the pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brushed my hair back with both my hands before getting out of the
          water, drenched and dripping from head to toe, my clothes sticking to
          me like a second skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blowing out a breath, I signaled to another soldier. "Turn the cameras
          back on," I said before turning to the other soldier, who had
          assisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Make it seem like she drowned, and you tried to revive her. Do not
          exert effort; I want her to stay dead." I said to the soldier, who
          dutifully went to his knees, pumping her chest with little effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          With one hand working on the buttons of my shirt, I made my way back
          to the gazebo, skin biting with irritation with what I had just put
          myself through, at the unconscious step I had taken towards being
          exactly like my father had been. My skin had a distinct crawling, and
          the urge to punish myself pulled strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head as if it would shake the sickening thoughts from my
          brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coughs and sputters sound breeze through my head, followed by a string
          of panicked curses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I halted, a frown dragging down my brows as I slowly turned to put a
          picture to my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was awake, coughing out water, her hand pressing at her throat,
          and the soldier staring with surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anger, burning flaming hot obdurate anger, flooded through my veins in
          waves. "What part of do not put in any effort, don't you fucking
          understand, estúpido!"
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't. She just—I—"</p>
        <p>
          I groaned, heading faster for the gazebo, and grabbing a gun,
          irritated that I couldn't even kill the soldier because I didn't want
          to hassle over finding the rest of his immediate family.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked back towards them. "Step away, and don't make me see you for
          weeks to come, or else...." I didn't need to finish that statement
          before he removed himself, rushing away from the pool area, towards
          the exit, and out of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared down at Zahra; her breathing was ragged, and her limbs were
          weak from her struggle to stay alive. Her eyelids flickered shut and
          opened in a battle to stay awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should have just stayed dead," I said, pointing the gun directly
          at her forehead. "Now I'd have to send people down to Saudi Arabia to
          find your little womb donor mother and kill her alongside any child
          she birthed. All because of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, but it was so sluggish. "I have—no relation—to—to
          her," she winced, coughing lightly. "Save yourself—the—the extra
          hassle and just do it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You share her blood, and her children share your blood. At least the
          husband will be spared."
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched me through half-closed eyes, her lips lifting to the side
          with a breathy laugh. "Fuck—you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed the safety from the gun, a few seconds away from pulling the
          trigger, when the exit door burst open. Devil stopped short when he
          saw the sight in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, shaking my head.</p>
        <p>"This thing called...luck." Her voice croaked out.</p>
        <p>
          Ignoring me, he rushed towards Zahra, immediately getting to his knees
          and lifting her body so her back was to his chest. "Hey, are you
          okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Peachy," she smiled at him, a whimper leaving her as she tried
          sitting upright on her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Get away from her, Elia. She's not whom you think she is," I said,
          still pointing the gun to her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil raised his head, a fury similar to mine, making his eyes glaze
          over. "Fuck off,"
        </p>
        <p>"Don't make me repeat it," I said.</p>
        <p>
          He ensured Zahra was okay before getting to his feet, his burning dark
          eyes dead set on mine. "First off, don't talk to me like I'm a fucking
          child, and secondly, how the fuck could do this? What the hell did she
          do to you?"
        </p>
        <p>"She killed without reason—"</p>
        <p>
          "Dion almost hurt her; it was self-defense." He bit back, and I almost
          pulled the trigger then and there, hating how she manipulated him and
          had him wrapped around her little finger.
        </p>
        <p>"Elia, she has you fooled, believe me—"</p>
        <p>
          "Believe you? Why the fuck should I believe you?" he yelled, voice
          raspy. "What reason do I have to believe any <i>fucking</i> word that
          comes out of your mouth." He shook his head, staring at me like I was
          a stranger. "You shouldn't have done this—you shouldn't have touched
          her, you sick bastard."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Open your eyes, Hermano; you're playing directly to her chords. She
          confessed to me. She told me she killed him because she had a score to
          settle with him. I have only ever been honest with you, except when it
          concerns your safety. Otherwise, I would never directly push you in
          harm's way, and that is what I would be doing if I let her live. She
          is bad for you, Elia."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil shook his head. "I would take her lies over yours any day, any
          time. I would take her bad over yours even in fucking death. There is
          absolutely nothing you could say to change my mind."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hardened my features, knowing I couldn't be soft on him. It had
          never worked.
        </p>
        <p>"Do not interfere, Elia."</p>
        <p>He stepped closer. "I'm not letting you touch her."</p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I raised the gun, pointing it right at him; the shock in his
          eyes—had my arms feeling too weak to even hold up the gun, but I held
          firm. "You either step away, or I kill you first and then kill her
          right afterward."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil's gaze slipped to the gun in my hand and then back to my eyes.
          "Bullshit," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head to the side. "I adore your faith in me, but the last
          thing you should do is test me, Devil."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Devil don't—" Zahra's voice pinched out from where she was, at the
          brink of passing out.
        </p>
        <p>"You can't do it," Devil said.</p>
        <p>"You think?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I know," he seethed out. "You're all fucking talk when it comes to
          me. Weak. Incompetent. A fucking failure."
        </p>
        <p>"I'd watch my mouth if I were you," I warned.</p>
        <p>
          "You could never do it," he continued. "All those years ago, you
          couldn't do it—"
        </p>
        <p>"Stop talking." The gun shook in my hand.</p>
        <p>
          "Why? Because it's the truth? Because deep down, you're still that
          weak fucker who got beat around by his dear old dad?"
        </p>
        <p>"Shut up, Elia." My breathing spiked.</p>
        <p>"What did it?" He asked.</p>
        <p>"Devil stop," Zahra's attempt to stop him was a failure too.</p>
        <p>
          "Tell me, what made you completely flip over? What turned you into
          him? Was it the thrill you got after murdering your whole family? Did
          you love your mother's scream while you stabbed her? Or Mariana and
          Lorenzo's tortured wails while you fucking burned them alive."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head. "Stop, Elia,"</p>
        <p>
          "Why? Be fucking honest with yourself, Elio; killing me would be your
          last tipping point, so fucking do it because I know you want to." He
          stepped closer to me. "I don't know why I didn't see it before, but
          it's clear now that me being alive is the only delusion you have of
          being a good person. But you're not. You're the one who needs to open
          your eyes, Elio. You didn't fucking kill me, but you killed an
          innocent 6-year-old instead of me. What the fuck is the difference?
          I'm alive because I'm the only physical trophy for the one good thing
          you have ever done."
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand shook again, his words reaching straight right to my heart.
          "Don't fucking degrade it," I said, my chest burning. "Don't fucking
          make it sound meaningless!" The yell racked through my whole body, and
          I threw the gun to God knows where. My eyes watered. "It took
          everything from me, you ungrateful bastard!" my voice shook.
          "Everything!"
        </p>
        <p>
          It was foolish doing this in front of Zahra or the soldiers who
          lingered by, but I was too riled up, hurt by his words and assumptions
          of me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "It took my whole life from me! That one fucking action, that little
          kid dying by my fucking bullet, took my whole life from me, and I did
          it all for you, Elia! All for you! So don't fucking stand here and
          make my whole life more meaningless than it already is!"
        </p>
        <p>Devil took a step back at my outburst.</p>
        <p>
          "Talk shit about me burning Mariana and Lorenzo alive; talk shit about
          me stabbing my mother, I'll take it all, but don't you dare question
          or degrade what I did for you. I'll take it from anyone but not you.
          Not you, Elia."
        </p>
        <p>
          A tear slid down his cheek, regret shining in his eyes, but he made no
          attempt to say anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wiped my face with both my hands, sniffing and shaking my head,
          hating this weakness with every fiber of my being. "Go...take her
          away. When she turns out to betray you, don't say I didn't try to warn
          you." I turned my attention to Zahra, remorse and the same regretful
          look in her eyes. "And you, stay clear of me because I swear to God,
          one more fucking problem from you, and this little drowning thing
          would seem like a fucking walk in the park."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, I snapped my fingers to one of the soldiers, and he rushed
          to me as I made my way toward the exit. "Pick up the gun, drain the
          pool, and clean it thoroughly. Take my things from the gazebo and
          bring them to me."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, Marino."</p>
        <p>I stopped. "Everything that happened here stays here."</p>
        <p>
          "The cameras were on, sir; it directly sent feeds to your home lounge,
          sir."
        </p>
        <p>"Wipe it."</p>
        <p>"Sir, Casmiro was in your home lounge, sir."</p>
        <p>
          I gritted my teeth. "That's okay. I trust him. Make sure those two get
          to their quarters without trouble."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, Marino."</p>
        <p>
          I walked away without a glance at them. The need to punish myself had
          vanished—no, it had been sated. The only person I loved hated me; the
          only person I lived for saw me as everyone else did.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the worse punishment I could ever get. It was both physical
          and emotional, and I held on to it, held on to that feeling like it
          was the very ice the burn in my chest needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held on to Elia's hate for me. It was all I'd ever wanted anyway; I
          just never thought it would feel even worse than the thought of dying.
        </p>
        <p>I never thought I would hate it so much.</p>
        <p>
          But then again, I deserved it. What right did I have to complain?<br /><br /><br />

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /><br /><br /></p>
        <p>
          <b>TAKING OVER</b> the Marino empire had been one of the hardest
          things I had ever done. It was easy faking my father's death,
          effortlessly slipping into his shoes and taking over from where he
          left off. But even with the 'Wicked' persona he had created for me
          before he 'died,' I had still struggled with our associates and other
          higher-ups who didn't see me as experienced enough to fill his shoes
          and run the business smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>I was too young compared to those fifty and above ages.</p>
        <p>
          Even now, though they didn't outrightly complain out of fear of
          crossing the wicked psychopath, who would likely wipe out their whole
          existence, there were still murmurs about it. The old ones were still
          too traditional with their ways, fearing to take things to the next
          level and strengthen their families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Old ones like Pablo, who firmly believed in bond and family, detested
          betrayal and could ruin the reputation of any house if he so much as
          called a meeting with his little oldies. The 67-year-old man was a
          grumpy, uninterested traditional leader who still led by old laws and
          believed in OMERTÀ .
        </p>
        <p><i>Delusional men.</i></p>
        <p>
          I was the lawless one, toying with politics and being almost legal. I
          was the one who betrayed and two-timed. I was reckless because I was
          young and didn't know actual loss and the love of family.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agreed. Love from family had been a miss for me. It never lasted. It
          was taken away, and so was my heart along sides those ashes, my
          conscience, and the feeling of right or wrong. All I had to do now was
          protect all I had left, and if having a sit down with Pablo in this
          very bright and un-sanitized city restaurant would help me accomplish
          that, then so be it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought my wrist to my view for the sixth time, watching people
          enter and exit the restaurant. Chatter, soft music in the background,
          and the smell of coffee and bread lingering in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          My knees bounced up and down absentmindedly, impatience curling in my
          stomach. "So unprofessional. How can a man like him disrespect time?"
          I complained, and Casmiro merely glanced at me with a slight lift of
          his shoulders, his eyes glued to the newspaper he was reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, reaching for my cigar packet and my lighter. I lit one up
          and placed it between my lips, eying Casmiro. "How long will you keep
          this up, hm?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't respond, and I shook my head. It had been three days since I
          returned home, and he was nowhere to be seen. He had apparently seen
          the footage; he knew what Devil meant to me but didn't say anything
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, he didn't say anything. I hadn't seen much of him. If he had
          a message to pass across to me, he'd send one of his men to deliver
          it. I gave him his space and time to process it, but it was apparent
          he needed more time to wrap it around his head that my father had
          another son, and he was Devil. And I hid it from everyone, including
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have work to do. We should be in agreement." I said, blowing out
          the smoke, nodding my head at the blast of the Vanilla flavor from the
          cigar. I rechecked the pack, reading what the stick was made of. "You
          should try this; it has a wonderful flavor." I extended it to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, he looked up from the newspaper, a scowl on his face as he
          watched me with disbelief. "I quit smoking, E. Three fucking years
          ago."
        </p>
        <p>I dropped the pack immediately. "I remember that."</p>
        <p>
          "Right, you do." He muttered, shaking his head and looking back at the
          newspaper, completely shielding his face from view.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, relaxing back on the chair, my fingers drumming on the
          table, my knees bouncing up and down, and I felt even more restless
          than I did before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "After this," I spoke again. "I will be visiting a gallery for an art
          exhibit. Mayor Artyom Smirnov invited me. He flew in from Russia a
          week ago and will be returning in two days; he wants to catch up
          because he thinks me an old friend. There will be lots of political
          talks and many things you can learn from."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll be busy." He said almost immediately after I finished talking.
        </p>
        <p>"Busy with what?"</p>
        <p>
          "I am overseeing some shipments for petroleum, oil, and gas here in
          Milan and over at Naples, Sicily, and now, Turin, thanks to the intel
          STREET retrieved from Dion."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "The one with five thousand barrels?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "That shipment will come six months from this one.
          They shifted the date due to two added containers."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "More barrels?"</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shrugged. "It's shipment for the Marino Caporegime sovereign
          society. Could be an illegal shipment of ammo, drugs, or people. It's
          not our business. We're only aiding. I signed off on it because I
          didn't want to have to go to their headquarters or bother you with it.
          It only delayed the shipment by six months."
        </p>
        <p>
          The MCSS. A tight-knit decades-old society in the body of the Marino
          empire. They had several associations with different Caporegimes from
          different families, inside and outside Italy. The society had been
          created under the supervision of my great-grandfather, and they
          brought in the second most significant illegal funds from whatever
          criminalistic business they depended on to keep the association
          standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I had a vague idea of this business, I didn't care enough to
          investigate further. They were sovereign, only in my name. They could
          do whatever they wanted. I was just supposed to make sure they did it
          without hurting the family name, which I didn't care about. It was in
          my right to stop it, but I had no reason to.
        </p>
        <p>
          They took 30% of the gains, gave the official Marino empire account
          about 30%, and the remaining 40%, for some reason, went directly to my
          account, which they had requested for the moment I took over my
          father's position. Since then, they'd been trying to rope me into
          their little cult. Every month, I get emails about the proceedings.
          They kept me in the loop like I was their god, and each email was like
          a prayer for me to bless and make it come true.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never gave them the time of day because I had more important things
          to worry about. I also never spend money unnecessarily, so the
          billions they send to me every year were primarily useless and
          never-ending, even after giving away to the charities under the Marino
          name and those outside the Marino name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably because I never showed up for their annual meetings and
          anniversary parties, they showed me respect. My father had always
          attended but kept me out of the spotlight, building my image with them
          and making them see me as the only leader who could do better than
          him, creating several assumptions that made them view me as this very
          intimidating man they had to protect at all cost.
        </p>
        <p>Foolishness in the form of human beings, they were.</p>
        <p>
          "So, which shipment are you going to oversee?" I asked Casmiro,
          bringing my mind back to the conversation at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A thousand Oil Barrels are coming from associates in South Africa."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," it clicked in my head, "My payment for the favor I granted."
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro nodded, concentrating on the newspaper.</p>
        <p>The silence dragged on until I spoke again.</p>
        <p>
          "But that was almost four years ago; I didn't ask for a return," I
          said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed in exasperation as if my voice annoyed him. "<i>Nobody</i>
          wants to owe you favors, Marino. The oil barrels were an out from the
          favor. They managed to gather it as payment."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, impressed. "Fair enough," I said.</p>
        <p>
          He ruffled the newspaper, indicating he didn't want to talk to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where in heaven's sake is that old man? I am very compelled to leave.
          The art exhibit is in two hours."
        </p>
        <p>"Patience," Casmiro groaned.</p>
        <p>
          I pressed the cigar's butt to the ashtray. The silence made me very
          uncomfortable. It was unlike Casmiro to keep silent when we were in a
          space together. He always liked asking questions, wanting to engage me
          in conversations, and knowing what I was thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          We even took separate cars to get here. It was unsettling and
          borderline childish.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why I preferred to avoid forming relationships. I should have
          never agreed to involve him in my matters and become his 'friend'
          again. We worked better when our childhood shenanigans were only a
          memory, never to be remembered. But he had begged me to let him in and
          trust him, and I had been candid with him. It appears he thought my
          warnings were nothing and that there was no way I could fuck it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can ask someone to cover the shipment overseeing for you. The
          exhibit is a medium for you to learn more about how politics work.
          Isn't that what you wanted?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is. But I have to oversee things myself and report back to you.
          That's my <i>job</i>." He said, and I didn't miss the bite in his
          tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was silent again, and my drumming increased. His grip on the
          newspaper tightened at the noise, and I decided to make the last push.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is so exciting in that—" he cut me off by slamming the newspaper
          on the table, and a few heads turn towards us.
        </p>
        <p>"So this is what you meant by being overbearing and talkative?"</p>
        <p>"You agreed to lend your ears."</p>
        <p>"Well, would it help if I said I don't feel like talking to you?"</p>
        <p>My eyes remained on his. "But you have to."</p>
        <p>"I don't."</p>
        <p>"Are we bickering?"</p>
        <p>
          He stared at me blankly for a while before confusion contorted his
          face. "What?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's what friends do, right? They bicker. They fight. They argue,
          but at the end of the day, they circle back and talk about the issue
          like mature, level-headed adults."
        </p>
        <p>He squared his jaw. "I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "I need us to work together to get Pablo off our back and
          turn this whole thing into another one of our favors. That can't
          happen if you are secretly plotting my murder."
        </p>
        <p>He scoffed, muttering something incoherent under his breath.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm here, aren't I? You have your fast-thinking, problem-solving
          underboss right where you need him. I don't know why we're having this
          conversation."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We are—" I stopped short when I spotted a familiar head of pink hair
          at one of the tables with a stranger, talking animatedly. "Is there a
          reason why Milk from STREET is only a few tables away from us?" I
          asked, and my question brought a frown to Casmiro's face.
        </p>
        <p>
          He started turning. "What—" he stopped when he spotted her too,
          confusion lining his brows as he turned back to me and stopped short,
          his eyes zeroing on the entrance. "Not just Milk,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed his vision, spotting Dog walking into the building with a
          white tank top showcasing band tattoos on his arms, his jacket tied
          around his waist, black ripped jeans, and what looked like costly
          boots. A lit cigarette was between his fingers as he looked around,
          not once looking at our table before heading to the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned when I saw Devil's figure right outside the building. He was
          leaning on a sleek white 2014 Chevrolet Impala, wearing a black
          leather jacket and jeans. And I felt a twinge of pride, seeing him
          wear my signature color. He was talking to Upper, who was pointing at
          a building by the side, explaining something to Devil, who just stared
          at him with boredom or disinterest; I couldn't quite place it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes swept from them, and I frantically looked around for the short
          one, but she wasn't inside the building or outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck is going on with our damn security?" Casmiro asked in
          wonder, a little anger lingering in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          About to look at Casmiro, I caught a figure approaching from the end
          of the STREET outside the glass window.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short hair pushed back by sunglasses, a carefree walking posture, and
          her mouth chewing gum mercilessly as she walked by. Somehow, she
          didn't look—short...she was wearing an armless shirt that didn't cover
          her navel and shorts that were too short and made it seem like she had
          legs for days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her skin was exposed to the sun, tanned, clear, and glowing like she
          had spent extra hours caring for it before leaving her house. She
          looked like a foreigner who left her travel crew to shop around for
          items she could use in decorating her room back in Los Angeles, where
          she probably lived in a studio apartment with a boyfriend who had gigs
          at low-rated bars in town. The tote bag she carried played off the
          role so well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, unable to take my eyes off her as she walked past Devil and
          Upper like they were random strangers. The people in question didn't
          even glance her way as she entered the restaurant, turning heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          She took the gum from her mouth and threw it in the waste bin closest
          to her, and I cringed at the carelessness in her actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Dog had done, she looked around, but this time, her eyes landed
          directly on our table, a determined smile curling at her lips as she
          walked towards us.
        </p>
        <p><i>Any day but today...any fucking day but today.</i></p>
        <p>She reached us. "Oh—"</p>
        <p>
          I got to my feet and encircled my hand around her wrist. Before she
          could even start the sentence, I was pulling her away.
        </p>
        <p>She yelled over her shoulder. "Hi Cassie, Bye Cassie!"</p>
        <p>
          I pushed past the door to the back room of the restaurant. Having
          glanced at the layout of the building in the car, I set my pace for
          the second door on the left, pushed it open, and pushed her inside,
          her back hitting the wall. 
        </p>
        <p>I locked the door behind me and turned.</p>
        <p>
          She was looking at me with surprise, and that was when I realized the
          room wasn't exactly as large as the layout shown, but it was big
          enough to put a 7 feet space between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow," she said breathlessly, leaning away from the wall. "Talk about
          taking me back to high school."
        </p>
        <p>"You never went to high school."</p>
        <p>
          "That's a very keen observation, Dad. Thanks for reminding me that I
          had a pretty shitty childhood."
        </p>
        <p>"Don't call me that,"</p>
        <p>
          "You called me Sport at the poolside; now we're even unless you call
          me Sport again; I make no promises—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed the distance between us, my palm slamming on the wall, a
          space an inch above her head, and her back pressed to the wall on
          reflex, wide eyes staring up at me. The white light in the storage
          room popped out the freckles on her cheek. I could smell whatever
          treatment she used on her hair, and in a swift moment, I was back on
          that roof with—
        </p>
        <p><i>Matter at hand.</i></p>
        <p>
          "Did you forget what I told you the last time we saw each other? If
          you caused any problems for me, the drowning would seem like a walk in
          the park?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're the one who dragged me in here like you wanted to fuck my
          brains out."
        </p>
        <p>That made my thoughts seize. "No, I didn't."</p>
        <p>
          She relaxed, her lips curving in a smile. "We're in some kind of
          supply closet," she inched higher, obviously standing on her toes as
          her gaze lowered to my lips, and I mirrored her action like her eyes
          had controlled mine. "And you're so close; you're towering over me,"
          her teeth clamped on her bottom lip swiftly before releasing it. "Now
          you can't even stop looking at my lips like you wanna kiss me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, growing uncomfortable. I felt the heat between our bodies.
          Warm and subtle, compelling a version much closer than the heat the
          small space between us provided.
        </p>
        <p>I locked my gaze back with hers.</p>
        <p>
          When I didn't pull away, the amusement died from her eyes, and this
          time, when her gaze flickered to my lips, it wasn't deliberate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hardened my form and pulled back, keeping as much distance between
          us as I mentally flicked myself in the head, shoving both hands into
          my pocket to avoid unintentionally getting them anywhere close to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was almost as if I lost all sense of reasoning when I saw her
          outside that window because I couldn't remember what I was thinking
          when I decided to pull her in here with me.
        </p>
        <p><i>Matter at fucking hand.</i></p>
        <p>"¿Qué quieres?" <i>What do you want?</i></p>
        <p>
          She cleared her throat, standing straighter. "Ayudarte." She answered.
          <i>To help you. </i>
        </p>
        <p>I raised a brow. "With what?" I continued in Spanish.</p>
        <p>
          "With Pablo." She said, reaching into the bag and pulling out a brown
          flat paper bag. "In here are documents proving Dion's illegal dealings
          behind the knowledge of their whole syndicate. Embezzling, cover-ups,
          and selling out of close company secrets to competitors." She
          responded in Spanish, so fucking fluent that it filled something empty
          in me. I was just as impressed as I had been the first time she had
          spoken it at long length, but unlike the last time when I didn't care
          to press on how she learned, I was now inquisitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          She waved her hand in front of my face, and I blinked, taking my hands
          from my pocket and collecting the file before taking the papers out
          and scheming through it. I glanced at her before looking back at the
          documents and asking. "How did you get this?"
        </p>
        <p>"Some secrets are mine to keep, Elio."</p>
        <p>
          I straightened. "This whole back-and-forth secret thing you have going
          on is starting to irritate me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That sounds like a <i>you</i> problem. Get those papers to Pablo and
          tell him you found out Dion was a sleazy bastard, and you took care of
          it because he was about to mess up one of your projects together.
          He'll thank you and forever be indebted to you because Pablo is
          traditional like that. Don't ask me how I know."
        </p>
        <p>
          I eyed her, the need to ask pinched at my insides, but I dropped it.
          "Why are you giving me this?"
        </p>
        <p>Something shifted in her eyes, and she swallowed.</p>
        <p>I sighed. "This isn't for free, is it?"</p>
        <p>
          Her lips thinned as she sucked in a breath and switched back to
          English. "While I would have loved to give you those papers for free
          because I caused this mess, and I always fix up my shit. We need your
          help."
        </p>
        <p>"The audacity you have is incomprehensible."</p>
        <p>
          She looked frustrated now. "I know we were supposed to stay indoors
          like good little obedient hostages. But this is pretty important."
        </p>
        <p>
          And I should walk out and ignore how tight her tone had gotten, but
          instead, I asked. "What have you gotten yourself into?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Almost four months ago, we were paid for a job that's supposed to
          happen today; we lost contact with the client for a long time, and
          they only just reached out two days ago."
        </p>
        <p>"I thought you work on your terms."</p>
        <p>"This case was different."</p>
        <p>I frowned. "I'm listening,"</p>
        <p>
          "It's to steal a painting," she fished for a phone in her bag, opened
          the picture, and showed it to me.  "It's a really weird painting of a
          twisted chihuahua dog, it's not really the prettiest thing, but—it's
          something these people want so bad."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away from the picture as she dropped the phone back in the
          bag. "I'm still not following how I could help you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We happen to know that in a few hours, you'll be going to the same
          exhibit as—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Forget it," I started coupling the papers back into the paper bag.
          "Not happening in this lifetime."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, come on, this is important."</p>
        <p>"And I should care because?"</p>
        <p>"Your brother is involved."</p>
        <p>
          I clenched my jaw. Maybe if I had shot him, this form of blackmail
          wouldn't be relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are under my protection; even if you don't steal
          the—weird—chihuahua painting, they can't reach you if you stay indoors
          like an obedient little hostage."
        </p>
        <p>
          Something changed in her demeanor, eyes widening in a plea. "We
          collected the money, and when we asked to refund. They refused. It's
          just one job, one stupid painting, and things will go back to normal.
          It's our fucking reputation on the line. We've never disappointed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you think I give an ounce of care for your reputation, then you
          have another thing coming."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know you don't care, but those documents in your hand could open
          the door for you. With Pablo."
        </p>
        <p>"I can as well do that on my own."</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes searched mine, and I knew she was trying to find a way to get
          me to agree. "Okay, fine, do this one thing for me, and I'll answer
          one question. Anything you wanna know about me, I'll answer
          truthfully."
        </p>
        <p>Interesting.</p>
        <p>I thought carefully about the question.</p>
        <p>"How are you related to Martino Conti," I asked.</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened as she gasped, taking a stumbling step back. "How—"
          she stopped; the horror in her eyes told me I had hit the nail on the
          head with that question, and my curiosity ate at me. Her eyes had
          shown all the emotions she would have loved to stay hidden, but she
          took a shaky breath and raised her chin a little, a stance to show
          courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I used to work for him, but I left." Her voice was solid and firm.
        </p>
        <p>"Why."</p>
        <p>"I answered your question." She snapped.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, dropping the topic. "You understand that many important
          people will attend the exhibit tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          She sighed in relief, her shoulders dropping as the tension slipped
          out of her, and she stood upright again. She nodded to my statement.
          "Yes, we had a whole plan to get in and steal the painting after the
          show, but—Angelo has confiscated a lot of our equipment, and we can't
          go in blindly with just comm devices and wits, and since I've gathered
          putting your brother in danger is unforgivable, you're my best shot at
          this."
        </p>
        <p>"I am not stealing a—chihuahua painting."</p>
        <p>
          "No, you're not, you're just getting one of us in as your plus one and
          getting us out to deliver to the buyer, and you can go back and merry
          away with your fellow buddies and talk about the weather."
        </p>
        <p>"This is ridiculous; why not buy the painting?"</p>
        <p>"They aren't selling. We tried."</p>
        <p>"Who am I taking along?"</p>
        <p>She let out a breath of relief. "Anyone of us. Milk is more—"</p>
        <p>
          "The dress code color for women is white. Please look responsible."
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked at me. "Oh, I'm not volunteering; I can't be among social
          gatherings like that."
        </p>
        <p>"Can't?"</p>
        <p>"I mean, I can bu—"</p>
        <p>
          "Good, I'll be done here in an hour top, be ready by then; if you're
          not, I'll leave you." I began to leave, but she held me back by my
          arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wai—whoa," she squeezed my arm, and I stood there in confusion. Her
          eyes flickered to mine and then back to my arm. "You've got—real solid
          muscles—Do you work out?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrenched my arm free from her hold. "Do you fondle people randomly?
          Because if you do, you must get that in check before tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't—why are you taking me? We can barely even stand each other as
          it is."
        </p>
        <p>"I disagree. The last few minutes are proof that we can."</p>
        <p>"That's because there are catches to be gained from being civil."</p>
        <p>
          "I don't care about the catches. It appears that after recent events,
          killing you is more hassle than it's worth."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I did warn you, and I still want to know why you're taking me with
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I searched my brain for a concrete answer before standing straighter.
          "Because I would rather take the muscle-fondling demon I know to the
          one I don't. There's also the fact that you speak good Spanish, and
          I'm impressed."
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked, trying to weigh if they were good reasons. "Oh, okay
          then. I'll see you in a few hours."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gave a nod and walked out of the supply closet, straightening my
          suit jacket the moment a female chef came out of the room opposite the
          one I stood in front of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra walked past me, offering the girl a wink before walking away
          with a confident sway to her—
        </p>
        <p><i>Matter at hand.</i></p>
        <p>
          I averted my gaze back to the girl, her cheeks growing red as she
          scurried away with imaginations that had never happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a sharp breath, shook my head at my situation, and returned to
          Casmiro. <br /><br /><br />

          Hi, I've been seeing a few comments, about Elio being referred to as
          the 'wicked' but isn't living up to the title because he shows
          emotions. so I wanted to clear the air. The first chapter titled 'Elio
          Marino' was told from an omniscient point of view, and it was there
          specifically to give you, the readers, the same assumptions everyone
          has of him. I'm happy to see that it is working the way it should. You
          assume the character is one thing, and when you read his point of
          view, you're seeing a person with emotions he refuses to acknowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know many 'mafia' themed stories out there give you a male lead who
          never shows emotions, or shows as rawly as Elio does (even though he
          himself doesn't see it) but this one isn't that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio only ever shows weakness when it comes to Devil, (for now) and
          this is because his relationship with him comes with a load of
          childhood trauma that he never got treated for. No therapist. No
          medical solution. Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is he referred to as "THE WICKED" Isn't due to his emotions, but
          his actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My characters are meant to make you 'feel' because they are
          'realistic' and they don't hide away from emotions that really matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to Elio; I'm sorry, but he is and will always be lenient when it
          comes to matters with Devil involved. (For now) And if you truly
          notice, him being with Devil is when an ounce of the kind of person he
          used to be, comes out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our past makes our present, and there's no telling when it will crawl
          up to bite you where it hurts. if you can't stand Elio being a normal
          person who actually shows emotions when he feels it's needed, then
          it's best to either accept it or find your kind of story where the
          character only cares for the female lead and no one else.
        </p>
        <p>
          But come on, imagine being loved by someone like Elio. it's
          unconditional, and I'm so jealous of future Zahra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, there is still a lot to come, and a lot of actions and
          decisions Elio will take that'll make you understand why people
          actually call him "The Wicked." The title was not given to him inside
          the knowledge that Devil was in his life, it was given outside of it.
          All you saw in that last chapter was Elio, without the forced title.
        </p>
        <p>
          I apologize if his showing emotions toward family don't live up to
          your expectations, but I can guarantee you that a person without
          conscience or the awareness of right or wrong is more dangerous than
          most of the stoic characters you see out there. Elio pre-character
          development isn't a prince charming, and you're about to find out why
          in the chapters to come.
        </p>
        <p>Till then, see you.</p>

          Hi! Thank you for your engagement on the last chapter! My energy was
          quite down, and I wasn't in the right head space when I updated,
          that's probably why you didn't see a surprise update!

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>"OKAY, ZAHRA</b>, we've got you in check," Dog said, handing the
          comm to Devil, who fixed it inside my ear. "Turn on the comm anytime
          you want to talk to us. The tracking device inside should let us know
          where exactly you are. Only when it's turned on."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "It should be turned on at all times." Devil reaffirmed. "On no
          account should we lose contact with you. Your phone should be in your
          hands all through. If something happens or the comm stops working,
          that's our next means of communication." He said.
        </p>
        <p>"Got it."</p>
        <p>
          "This is the first time one of us goes on a mission alone, and I don't
          like it." Milk said from the corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't like it either," Upper chorused, shoving both hands into his
          pocket. "But this is our only chance with getting that painting and
          those fuckers off our backs."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Chin up, guys. It will be the last pity job we'll ever run." Dog
          said. "Zahra, confident enough? After last time—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled at him and then at all of them staring at me with worry.
          "Guys, come on. I can do this; I'm perfectly okay, mind and body."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil shook his head. "It's not that. It's the person you're going
          with."
        </p>
        <p>"I can handle him," I assured.</p>
        <p>
          "Like you handled him when he tried to drown you." Dog muttered. "That
          bastard."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "I've survived more than that. <i>Worse</i> than that. I've
          survived in cases most people weren't lucky enough to survive. Trust
          me on this, guys. Some kind of higher power is watching over me; I
          can't die easy."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I trust you," Milk said, sucking in a breath as her eyes scanned my
          form from head to toe, "and you look fire in that dress. A smart woman
          once said, a good dress brings good luck."
        </p>
        <p>"Pretty sure you made that one up," Dog muttered.</p>
        <p>"I didn't."</p>
        <p>
          My hand ran down the length of the dress: It was a thin, strapped,
          white silk dress that stopped mid-thigh. I opted to wear a
          waist-length straight brunette wig, which was parted in the middle and
          tied into a low ponytail. It was sleek and classy, making my face pop
          out, accentuating my cheekbones, and the dark brown lipstick I wore.
          My makeup was minimal; Milk had hidden my freckles, and paid attention
          to my eyeliner, which was dark and sharp, giving me a slant-eye look.
          I looked less like Zahra and more like a sophisticated rich escort.
        </p>
        <p>My heels also made me look taller, and I was mostly ready to go.</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you." I directed at Milk. "But I still hate the fact that we're
          doing this for such a little amount of money. Do you think we should
          have demanded more since they want it so badly?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil shook his head. "No, we should be done with them. I don't have a
          good feeling about it. I mean, they reached out to us months ago, sent
          the money, and disappeared, and then out of nowhere, they pop up
          again, wanting it tonight, when we were supposed to have it in our
          possession for like a week before delivering, just like they planned,
          but now all of a sudden, they need it...something doesn't sound right
          about that."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe they had a change of plans?" Milk said.</p>
        <p>
          "That could be the case, but what about the radio silence all this
          time." Upper chipped in.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They didn't wanna contact us for whatever fucking reason. Let's get
          this over with. Devil's right, it doesn't fucking feel right, and I'm
          pissed because we would have been paid more if we'd known they wanted
          it this bad." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a hard knock on the door, followed by a gruff voice.
          "Marino's here; get out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Watch your fucking tone!" Dog yelled at the soldier outside our door.
          "Rude fucking motherfuckers." He said, beckoning to Upper to recheck
          the sound transmitter for my comm device while Milk disappeared into
          the kitchen to probably grab beers and snacks to keep them alert for
          the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sucked in a breath, channeling my social spirit, my pretense aura,
          and my alter ego.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Devil held my elbow, gently pulling me towards the door. "You
          sure you can do this?" he asked quietly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am. I was serious when I said I knew how to handle him. He doesn't
          scare me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, but—it still doesn't stop me from worrying, Z. I don't even
          want you to be in the same space or even-country-with him at this
          point. I don't trust him with you."
        </p>
        <p>"Then trust me."</p>
        <p>
          "I do," he whispered, fingers running up my arm in a sweet,
          nerve-awakening brush. "I trust you to come back to me in one piece—"
          his gaze flickered to my eyes and then back to his fingers on my arm.
          "Because...when you come back, there's...something I wanna tell you,"
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "What is it?"</p>
        <p>
          He smiled. "Good, now you gotta come back to me in one piece, so you
          can hear it."
        </p>
        <p>I smiled, shaking my head at him. "You're a devil."</p>
        <p>
          His hand on my arm moved to hold the side of my face, just below my
          ear, his fingers rubbing at my neck, as He leaned down to press a kiss
          to my lips, careful not to ruin my lipstick, before pulling away and
          speaking with a hoarse voice. "If he tries anything, I give you
          permission to shoot him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Y-yeah, of—" I breathed in, clearing my throat as my response came
          out squeaky and breathless. "Of course, if that's what you want."
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect Devil's presence had on me was growing every day, and I
          wondered if whatever he wanted to tell me entailed us actually putting
          a label on our relationship—no, no.
        </p>
        <p>I tamped down on the hope bubbling in my chest.</p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "You should get going; we'll start up here." He pulled
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned towards Upper and Dog on the couch, catching Upper's stare on
          us. His eyes held an emotion that had me frowning slightly. But it
          disappeared as quickly as I spotted it, and he forced on a carefree
          smile. "Be safe. We don't have visuals, so the sound of your voice and
          the voices in your background are the only things we have to get by."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Of course, see you guys soon."</p>
        <p>
          We bid our goodbyes, and I forced away the thoughts that swept through
          me after that look from Upper.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was still there, at the surface, a question I feared the
          answers to.
        </p>
        <p>Did Upper have feelings for...Devil?</p>
        <p>It couldn't be possible, could it?</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head off the thought, walking towards the black car with
          black tinted windows. As I approached, the driver opened the door for
          me with a slight bow, and I thanked him with a smile before getting
          into the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was at the other side, holding a black hardcovered book in his
          hand, his reading glasses on his face, as he flipped the pages and
          spoke without looking at me. "Good Evening." He greeted politely,
          bringing a frown to my brows.
        </p>
        <p>"Uh...yeah, evening?" That came out jumbled up.</p>
        <p>
          He looked dangerous, wearing a black trench coat, and a men's turtle
          neck shirt, with black slacks and shoes. All colorless. His silver
          watch glinted with the light in the car as we started moving. His
          rings on tattooed fingers also complimented his wristwatch's twinkles,
          drawing me to how lithe and well-kempt his fingers were.
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed. "Aren't you hot?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "No," he responded but still didn't take his eyes from the book, a
          frown drawing down his brows slowly as he read.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know the air-con is on, but you could at least take off the trench
          co—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck?!" He yelled suddenly, making me jump as he snapped the
          book shut, closing his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gasp was loud, and my hand had flown to my chest at his sudden
          outburst; even the car swirled a little out of line before balancing
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared at him with wide eyes. "Why the hell did you yell like that?
          If you didn't want to remove the trench coat, you could have just said
          so, Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          He opened his eyes again, sighing. "It's not the trench coat," he was
          saying as he turned his head to look at me, "It's the book—why are you
          wearing a nightgown?" his intense grey eyes took me in, gaze lingering
          on my exposed lap, then my cleavage, before settling back on my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Ha! He called it a nightgown." </i>Dog's voice reached my ear.
        </p>
        <p>"It's not a nightgown; it's a dress—"</p>
        <p>"Where's your hair?" Elio asked distaste in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Under the wig? I wanted a disguise because I can't be seen as myself
          on a job."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched his eyes take in my face before he looked away, shaking his
          head as he muttered, "Ridiculous."
        </p>
        <p>
          That made anger blossom in the pit of my stomach. "I didn't dress up,
          seeking your validation."
        </p>
        <p>
          A muscle ticked in his jaw. "I specifically asked you to look
          responsible."
        </p>
        <p>"This isn't responsible enough for you?"</p>
        <p>
          His head turned in my direction again. "No. You look like an
          unscrupulous escort. You look—fake, not responsible."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"I really want to re-arrange his face. It's like a burning urge.
            Let us find time to tie him up and fuck up that face like we did to
            that biker dude a year ago." </i
          >Dog spoke.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Ignore him, Zahra; focus on the mission,"</i> Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"He clearly doesn't have eyes,"</i> Milk muttered in annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze shifted to my ear, where Devil had placed the comm, and then
          he looked back at me. "If you and your little choir group ruin today
          for me, I will ensure you don't return alive."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is that a promise?" I asked with a smile, and he looked away from me,
          a frown on his face, as he opened his book again and didn't look up
          once or respond to me until we got to our destination.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          When we pulled up to the front of the gallery, the door was opened for
          me by one of the chaperones; I smiled at them, looking up to see
          paparazzi taking endless pictures. I spotted three more cars pull up
          behind us, Marino soldiers filing out of each, guarding the perimeters
          as if the security provided at the gallery was a joke.
        </p>
        <p>"This is a big event," I whispered.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"That was exactly why we decided to go after the show. We don't
            have that much time since the buyer was specific with it."</i
          >
          Devil said.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"10:00 PM Zahra, you need to be at the meeting point by then. Even
            before then, if possible. There would be fewer people at the
            docks."</i
          >
          Dog voiced.
        </p>
        <p>"Copy that," I responded.</p>
        <p>
          Even with my disguise, I still tried to hide my face from the camera
          flashes, and when Elio came to stand beside me, now without his
          reading glasses, giving me his elbow to put my hand through, I smiled
          up at him, and he looked away, not returning it, as I'd expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come to think of it; I'd never seen this man smile. He was either
          indifferent or annoyed half the time, and right now, he looked neither
          indifferent nor annoyed, just blank.
        </p>
        <p>
          We made our way toward the entrance, where he pulled out a fancy card
          and handed it to one of the door attendants, who nodded and greeted us
          before letting us through.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inside of the building was bright and had the perfect temperature,
          warm and homely, cold and relaxing. There were people in twos
          everywhere, men wearing black suits and women wearing white dresses,
          chatting, drinking expensive wine, staring at sculptures or paintings,
          snapping pictures of themselves, and laughing like they were having
          the time of their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up at Elio, a smile curling on my lips. "Isn't it wonderful?"
        </p>
        <p>He looked over at me with a frown. "What."</p>
        <p>
          "Us...being here together. Anyone looking at us right now wouldn't
          know you tried to drown me in your pool just a few days ago." I
          laughed, shaking my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          His intense grey eyes watched me. Completely unnerving because he just
          stared, with no expression, word exchange, or response; he just looked
          at me, and when my laugh died down, I cleared my throat, looking away
          from him. "Weirdo," I muttered.
        </p>
        <p>"Marino?"</p>
        <p>
          "Por favor." <i>Please.</i> He groaned under his breath, a woman
          rushing towards us with a drink and a dashing grin on her
          maroon-painted lips. "Grace," he said, a cheer to his voice that
          didn't reach his eyes or tug a smile to his lips as he detangled my
          hand from his and turned toward the woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was gorgeous. Her white dress was lacy and looked like the
          industry's most professional designers designed it. Her curvy
          voluptuous body hugged the material like it was sewn to her skin. Her
          eyes were the brightest brown, complimenting her long curly light
          brown hair, which added to the shine of her delicate brown skin. She
          would have intimidated the old Zahra, who felt inferior in the
          presence of other women with a normal childhood and upbringing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if I was being honest with myself, there was still a twinge of
          that feeling, but it was suppressed because my eyes left hers to scan
          through the paintings hanging on the wall, looking for the twisted
          chihuahua.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What a pleasant surprise," Grace voiced again, and I looked back at
          her. Her accent was the same as Upper's, but a bit older and classier,
          like she had come from a family of royals.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed?" Elio said, taking her hand in his and kissing her knuckles
          like a gentleman. The need to snort gripped me, but I held firm,
          watching the exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I really wish we could have gotten visuals."</i> Milk said.
          <i>"That voice sounds like it belongs to a beautiful person."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," the woman blinked in a blush, looking like there were stars in
          her eyes after Elio dropped her hand. "You never attend these
          gatherings; it is quite a shock to see you here, I must admit."
        </p>
        <p>
          Without warning, his arms snaked around my waist, warm and strong as
          he pulled me to his side, so affectionate, I didn't think I was able
          to hide my shock in time. "Blame my woman." He said with such
          fondness, his behavior supplying me a healthy dose of whiplash. "She
          has longed to attend this event for months; a certain painting caught
          her eye, and she wanted to see it for herself."
        </p>
        <p><i>My woman?</i></p>
        <p>
          Grace's eyes shifted to me, a smile on her face. "Oh, hello." She
          extended her hand in, which I shook. "I'm Grace Alden, a pleasure to
          meet you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Layla Rahal, a pleasure to meet you too, Grace," I said, dropping my
          hand from hers to place on Elio's chest, feeling his muscles tense
          underneath my palm, but he made no move to show his discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's beautiful, isn't it?" Grace said, gesturing around. "I've also
          wanted to see this for months now. I flew in from London three days
          ago. I tried to get in touch with Marino, but sadly, he was
          unavailable at that time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "Three days ago? hm..." I looked up at Elio, feigning
          confusion. "Baby, wasn't that the pool party day?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched, but he nodded. "I think so," he said, playing along
          with whatever this was. "I apologize, Grace, we had people over, and
          many things were going on simultaneously."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, and I almost drowned." I blurted.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh dear," Grace said, genuine concern on her face. "That must have
          been terrible. Are you okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, fortunately, Elio also happened to be in the pool, and he saved
          me." I looked up at him, our gazes locking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I did." His voice dropped deeper. "I would have hated for you to miss
          all that I have planned for you, <i>Querida</i>." <i>Darling.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          My mouth grew dry, almost like the intensity of his gaze sucked every
          single liquid from my body. The press of my side to his became more
          prominent in my senses. He was warm against me, and I felt a
          tantalizing shiver sweep through my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze dropped to my cleavage shamelessly, and it felt like someone
          was blowing softly at my nipples; I felt them press to the material of
          my dress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's grip tightened on my waist, gaze briefly raising to my lips
          before he broke the connection, looking back at Grace, who seemed to
          have just witnessed something private between Elio and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry to cut this short, Grace, but we have places to be after
          this, and I need to say hi to the Mayor; it was a pleasure meeting you
          again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, of course, take care," she said before turning to me and going
          for a hug.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved away from Elio's side to hug her, knowing people like these
          prefer hugs to handshakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He looks at you like he wants to eat you. Keep him." She whispered to
          me, and I cringed, knowing the rest of STREET could hear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled at her when she pulled away with a wink before walking in the
          other direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who was that?" I asked, looking back at Elio and immediately
          remembering how he had touched me with his eyes. The last person I
          should feel any sexual attraction to was Elio. Yes, he was sinfully
          attractive and oozed an unhealthy dose of sex appeal, but there was
          that pull between us...so damn strong that I was almost positive I
          wasn't the only one feeling it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio cleared his throat. "A person I know." He stated, answering and,
          at the same time, not answering. "Go find your painting; I'll find you
          when I finish with the Mayor."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have to get the painting to the buyer by 10 PM and go without
          security. How do we shake off your soldiers."
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes took me in from head to toe, his response delayed by a few
          seconds before he scanned the area. "Leave that to me; I'll find you
          before the time. Don't touch anything else." He said before turning
          and walking away to a group of men at the far end.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, guys, let's find the chihuahua."</p>
        <p><i>"Am I the only one thinking it?"</i> Milk said.</p>
        <p>
          "Thinking what?" I asked, walking casually while looking around for
          the painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Is it possible to feel tension without seeing it, like just from
            sounds and quietness that's a bit static?" </i
          >Milk said.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Audio porn?"</i> Dog inquired.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Yeah, but like, between people who don't like each other—"</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"Shut up, Milk. Do you see the painting, Z?"</i> Devil asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Nope, I'll check the other aisle," I said, walking away from Elio's
          view of me to a different showing area, there were as many people in
          here as the first aisle, and I looked around, walking down with
          attentiveness.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Anything?" </i>Upper asked.</p>
        <p>"It's not here either."</p>
        <p><i>"Fuck, you think someone got to it before us?"</i> Dog cursed.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"We're the only ones hunting for it, right?" </i>The wary in Milk's
          voice didn't escape me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"The buyer was vague with their email. They didn't exactly give
            anything away, just that we needed to get it."</i
          >
          Upper informed.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Keep looking,"</i> Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          I did keep looking, and I was stopped by two men who tried to flirt
          with me, but I politely brushed them off.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"It's 9:42, Zahra,"</i> Dog said, and I was already at the third
          and last aisle. I knew quite a lot of time had passed with me
          searching.
        </p>
        <p>"I think somebody nicked it. It's not in this—"</p>
        <p>"Sport."</p>
        <p>
          I turned immediately, seeing Elio approach me, both hands in his
          pocket. "Let's go."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "I haven't found the—"</p>
        <p>"Follow me," he brushed past me.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"What the fuck is he doing? You can't leave without that painting." </i
          >Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was already walking down the hall to the nearest elevator, his
          strides long that I found myself walk-running after him. "I can't
          leave without the painting," I gritted out.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reached the elevator, pressed a button, and walked in. I groaned,
          stepping in after him as the doors slid close. He pushed the L button,
          which I guessed stood for Lot, seeing the car symbol atop it. We
          started going down.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"We cannot fuck this up; I will lose my shit if we do," Upper
            said.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>"Why are we leaving?"</p>
        <p>"It's almost ten, no?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, but—" The elevator stopped after a short while and slid open
          again; he walked out, and I rushed out after him; his hand left his
          pocket, bringing out a key and pressing a button. A car beeped to life
          in the distance, and someone leaned away from it quickly, wearing a
          waitress uniform.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes widened as I took in the sweet ride. "Holy mother of fucking
          Lambor-huracan-ghini." I whispered.
        </p>
        <p><i>"You're shitting me."</i> Upper's voice reached my ear.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Car slut."</i> Devil cursed, but I could hear the amusement in his
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<i>Zahra, please sneak a picture, please—please," </i>Upper begged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled out my phone, took a quick picture, and sent it to him. His
          squeal of excitement almost had me deaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car was matte black and sleek. It was so low that it almost kissed
          the ground. I just knew I was looking at millions of dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The waitress straightened, holding a painting in her hand. "Sir, as
          you wanted." She extended the painting to Elio when we reached her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The painting..." I trailed off, watching him collect the medium-sized
          frame wrapped in a secure, transparent nylon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twisted chihuahua stared at me. Why the fuck would anyone want
          this? I'd scream bloody fucking Mary if I had to wake up to this
          hanging on my wall.<i></i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The waitress shot a stiff nod to him and then to me before walking
          towards the elevator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio handed the painting over to me. "Come on; I have places to be,"
          He said, already walking around towards the driver's side, none of his
          security in sight. I rushed to the passenger's side of the car,
          entering what smelt and looked like leather heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why did you tell me to go find the painting when you already found
          it?"
        </p>
        <p>He started the engine, and the car roared to life.</p>
        <p>
          He glanced my way. "Your presence was beginning to get insufferable."
          He said before pulling the car out of the parking spot and driving
          towards the entrance.
        </p>
        <p>"Ha, ha, very funny."</p>
        <p>"No, it's not." He responded, entering the main road.</p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him. "You weren't supposed to respond to that—like it's
          one of those statements where you just don't respond."
        </p>
        <p>"I wanted to respond because it's my mouth, <i>Querida</i>,"</p>
        <p>"No, we're not doing that. Don't call me that."</p>
        <p>
          Still driving, he looked my way, "What. You don't like Sport; you
          don't like Darling—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Darling is fucking cool; I'm all for it, but when you say it, it's
          like you're mocking me."
        </p>
        <p>"But that's exactly what I'm doing. Mocking you."</p>
        <p>"Anyone ever told you, you were an asshole?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"You're an asshole."</p>
        <p>
          The car swirled suddenly, tires screeching, and my heart jumped to my
          throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the car settled again, I was heaving. "Motherfucker! Just because
          you have a death wish doesn't mean I do too."
        </p>
        <p>He glanced my way, looking very calm as he said. "Seatbelt."</p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, securing my seatbelt and getting ready for this night to be
          over.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Elio drove like he had extra lives, and in order to swallow my fear
          and hold on to my pride, I didn't utter a word because he got us to
          the meeting point at exactly 9:59 PM.
        </p>
        <p>
          I unhooked the seatbelt and wasted no time getting out of the car, a
          gag rising in my throat at how wobbly my feet felt. I brought out the
          painting and dropped my bag on the seat, slamming the door. The sight
          of the boats rocking atop the water by the docks, and the cold breeze,
          helped suit my urge to throw up. I needed to remove this wig and feel
          the breeze in my hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio got out of the car, looking pointedly at the black SUV a few feet
          away from us. "Your buyer?" he asked with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>"Should be," I answered, looking around us.</p>
        <p>
          It was dark, safe for the dim lamp lights around the boats and the
          small cabin a few feet away. An unsettling feeling came with the
          atmosphere, and it made the hair at the back of my neck stand in an
          alert.
        </p>
        <p>There was no one else here.</p>
        <p>"Let's get this over with," I said, going to the SUV.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait, something's not rig—or just walk right into the pending danger.
          Estúpida." He groaned, but I heard his footsteps fall right behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached the SUV but stopped short when I saw the person inside the
          car. His head was resting on the headrest, eyes wide open in death,
          with a bullet wound between his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit, He's dead," I said.</p>
        <p><i>"What the fuck?" </i>Dog's voice rang out in alert.</p>
        <p>
          Elio pushed me aside and approached the body, hand touching his skin.
          "It's still warm. It just happened." He said.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit, Guys, the mission has been compromised."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Are you bloody shitting me three times in a row? Somebody fucking
            jinxed us."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze snapped to a spot behind me at a slight click sound, and
          he groaned in annoyance. "Great."
        </p>
        <p>
          He forcefully pulled my body down in sudden alert, and the next thing
          I heard was multiple strings of bullets firing shots directly at us.

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>ADRENALINE PUMPED</b> through my veins as Elio and I ducked,
          running around the car to take immediate cover. The bullets weren't
          seizing, and as each came, they hit the black SUV that stood as our
          cover, shattering its windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hissed as the glass sprinkled around us, light and sharp edges,
          raining without grace, but not enough to cause significant
          damage—mainly to Elio since he was covered from head to toe, unlike
          me, whose skin was exposed to any little cut. My breathing was harsh
          due to how fast my heart was working. "What the fuck is happening?" I
          gritted out as Elio reached behind him, seeming very calm as he
          brought out his gun, checking the bullet casing.
        </p>
        <p><i>"It's an ambush, that's what," </i>Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Connection's failing, fuck..." </i>Upper said, his voice a distant
          static, but I could still pick out its tight edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I still don't get it. An ambush for a painting?" I said, breathless
          and annoyed. I hated shit like this. Being caught off guard was the
          most fucking inconvenient thing in the entire universe; it takes away
          focus and the ability to think fucking straight. Elio shifted beside
          me, lifting his head a little to—I guess—see who was shooting or how
          many of them were there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another string of bullets came, slapping against the car in sharp
          thudding noises, one that worried my ear and sent my blood running
          hot. Elio ducked immediately, cursing while sending a stern glare my
          way. "They're about 6 of them, maybe more. We have one gun, and I am
          in no mood to kill anyone tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes widened at him. "Well, if you haven't noticed, they're kind of
          in the mood to kill us." I gritted.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked around before his gaze settled on the Lamborghini a distance
          away, and then he looked back at the SUV we were shielding ourselves
          with. "Okay, I'll cover you."
        </p>
        <p>"Wai—"</p>
        <p>
          "On my signal, you'll open this door and check the glove compartment
          for weapons."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What—" The side mirror shattered beside my head, and I cursed,
          ducking further down as I whisper-yelled at him. "What if there aren't
          any weapons? Got any other smart ideas?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He grunted, almost as if he couldn't deal with me, and then in
          urgency, gave me the gun. "Cover me. I'll do it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck—" He was already opening the door as if people weren't
          shooting at us. "Shit." I got in position; the gun was heavy on my
          grip as I shot back at them, bullets flying blindly in the direction
          of the boats, and I caught dark figures ducking. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As fast as he had raised to open the door, Elio was back beside me, a
          gun in his hand, which he quickly clicked in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How did you know—" A shot wheezed past my ear, and I groaned, swiftly
          getting back in position to find the fucker reloading his gun. I set
          the angle, targeting the side of his head, before pressing the
          trigger. His body dropped lifelessly to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my chest pounding, I retook cover, only to find Elio's eyes on
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Some—ahh!" I winced in pain as the comm in my ear sent out a sharp
          noise that had me rushing to take it out. The device was hot against
          my hand, and I quickly threw it to the ground, my ear burning. I
          grazed the spot and brought my shaking fingers to my view, blood
          staining them. "Motherfucker!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have to get to the car," Elio's voice reached me, and I realized
          he hadn't been shooting back. "First, we need—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of tires screeching reached our ears, and I turned to look
          at the cars; a bunch of black SUVs pulled up roughly without
          formation, men filing out of them like fucking ants. "Are those your
          people?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio watched the new change, confusion dragging down his brows. "No,"
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the men stopped by our ride, checking it carefully before
          stepping back and shooting at the windows and the tires of the
          Lamborghini, in other words, killing our means of escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shooting doubled now, no longer aimed at us but at the people who
          were once shooting at us.
        </p>
        <p>"Throw it in!" somebody yelled, followed by an engine revving.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh shit," I muttered as two SUVs came slamming at the Lamborghini,
          making it shift forward violently. The SUV riders didn't care about
          the damage the hit did to their cars when they reversed again before
          stepping on the gas and colliding into Elio's car; I watched it groan
          and tumble before falling into the water with a thick splash.
        </p>
        <p>After that, the space between Elio and me went quiet.</p>
        <p>
          I blinked, turning ever so slowly to Elio, who sucked in a deep
          breath, lips pressed tightly together.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am genuinely sorry. I felt that right in my heart. The beauty
          didn't deserve to go down like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          He swallowed. "That apology should be addressed to Casmiro if ever we
          see him again."
        </p>
        <p>"That was his car?" I asked in a wheeze.</p>
        <p>"No. That was his baby."</p>
        <p>"Shit."</p>
        <p>
          Elio moved past me swiftly, showing me his back as he scanned the
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A full-on shoot out happening around us, and I knew it wouldn't be
          long before the new people realized we were actually the ones with the
          painting.
        </p>
        <p>"Our cover is about to be blown," Elio said.</p>
        <p>
          My chest was heaving, and I gripped the gun tightly. "What the fuck
          are we gonna do?"
        </p>
        <p>"We have to be quick."</p>
        <p>I frowned. "What do you mean by we have to be quick?"</p>
        <p>He looked back at me. "We're going to make a run for it."</p>
        <p>
          I searched his eyes for any hint of a joke. There was none. "No, we
          can't—"
        </p>
        <p>He grabbed my wrist. "Come on, on the count of three—"</p>
        <p>"No, wait, we're not—"</p>
        <p>"Two."</p>
        <p>"We have no fucking cover E—"</p>
        <p>
          Without waiting to count to one, He was on his feet, pulling me along
          with him as we sprinted down the open area toward the SUVs.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the corner of my eyes, I saw one of the boats filled with men
          taking covers and shooting at the other party that had just arrived.
        </p>
        <p><i>What the fucking hell is happening?</i></p>
        <p>
          Elio pulled us down again behind one of the SUVs. He blew out a short
          breath, his eyes doing that sharp movement thing again as he looked
          around. "Were you shot?" he asked like it was the most regular
          question to ask a person.
        </p>
        <p>"No, I wasn't, as much as you'd love that." I bit out.</p>
        <p>
          He ignored me. "We're taking one of their cars, they'll probably chase
          after us, but you have an upstanding aim, so we should be fine."
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my eyelids shut before snapping them back open, trying to
          steady my breathing. "Fuck...this is messed up. What the fuck is in
          this painting? They literally brought a whole goddamn army."
        </p>
        <p>"How much were you paid to retrieve it?"</p>
        <p>
          I hesitated, sucking in my pride as I spoke. "Five thousand dollars."
        </p>
        <p>
          His head snapped towards me sharply. "Five thousand dollars?" he
          almost yelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, it was a moment of weakness; trust me, we regret taking the
          job."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nobody would send this many people to kill for a painting worth 5
          thousand dollars." He stated, stern gaze locked on mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          We stared at each other, my head roaming with thoughts, mind racing,
          gears shifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well fuck," I finally spoke, cocking the gun. "Now four parties are
          gunning for this fucking twisted chihuahua."
        </p>
        <p>This time, Elio frowned. "Four?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, the person who paid us, the people who shot him, the people
          currently shooting at the people that shot him, and now us, the people
          who stole it."
        </p>
        <p>Elio shook his head in disbelief. "Greedy fucking thief."</p>
        <p>I smirked. "Psycho fucking killer."</p>
        <p>
          He let out a frustrated sigh, "Come on," and then he was moving again;
          I followed him swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We quietly cornered through the maze of cars, ducking when we came in
          line with some of the men standing guards while the others shot at the
          boat people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held tighter to the painting, knowing that whatever it was, it had
          to be something big. Big enough to wreck this amount of chaos in such
          a short period.
        </p>
        <p>"Hold," Elio said, stopping, and I froze behind him.</p>
        <p>Scoffing, I tsk. "Acting like you were in the army," I muttered.</p>
        <p>
          "I was," he said without looking back. "A year. It was enough to learn
          that when a superior says hold, you fucking shut your mouth and hold."
        </p>
        <p>
          I did shut up, stretching my neck to see him eying a car by a near
          end; a man stood there alert, gun in hand, looking for any unusual
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>"We're taking that one," Elio said, voice low, calm, and precise.</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, sure, what's the plan? Walking up to him and asking to borrow
          his car because we have to run away from him?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's form stilled for about three seconds before he suddenly stood
          upright, turning to me as his head tilted to the side, eying me from
          head to toe.
        </p>
        <p>I took a step back. "Whatever you're thinking? It's a bad idea."</p>
        <p>"Scream." He commanded.</p>
        <p>I frowned. "What?"</p>
        <p>"Scream. Now."</p>
        <p>"I'm not just gonna fucking—"</p>
        <p>
          His hand wrapped around my throat, and he slammed my body into one of
          the cars, causing an instinctive shriek from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body pressed to mine, all rugged ridges over the soft curve of my
          body as he whispered to my face. "Now, was that so fucking hard," his
          hand gripped my ponytail, pulling off the wig and removing the wig
          cap. My hair fell free, and then he was gone, disappearing behind
          cars. It all happened within seconds, and I didn't have time to catch
          myself or to hear the footsteps before it reached me; the man from the
          car earlier was standing there, gun in hand, confusion on his face as
          he stared at me, holding the painting for dear life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Um..." I voiced, allowing my voice to take on a vulnerable and shaky
          edge. "I don't know what's happening, but I was asked to deliver this,
          and then people were shooting, and now there are too many cars and too
          many dead people," something shifted behind the man, "and I just wanna
          go home because I'm so scared," fake crying. "I didn't plan to do
          this, but my fucking boyfriend said it would be quick, but now it's
          messed up, one minute I was dressed up for our date together," Fake
          heave. "and the next, he gives me this ugly painting and tells me his
          friend Marcus would be here, and then he had a bullet to his head, and
          then the gunshots and I don't wanna die because I have college and
          fashion school and my whole future." Fake sob. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss—" he couldn't complete his statement because Elio was bashing
          his head in with a—a stone potted plant which shattered on impact. The
          man falls with a dull thud to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, staring at him blankly. "A potted plant, really?" my voice
          returned to normal.
        </p>
        <p>"Why."</p>
        <p>"I don't know, maybe because you have a gun in your hand?"</p>
        <p>
          "I told you I wasn't in the mood to kill anyone tonight." then he bent
          and searched the man's pocket, got the SUV keys, and walked in its
          direction silently; I followed behind him as he unlocked the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          We got in, locking the doors silently. "I don't get you. One minute
          you're a psychopath who kills innocent people, and the next, you're
          not?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched as he turned sharply toward me. "What do you want
          from me, Zahra? Should I get out of the car and go back to kill him,
          take his wallet and find his ID card and then hunt down his wife and
          children and put a bullet through their fucking heads?"
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed, blinking. "The potted plant was more creative."</p>
        <p>"Good."</p>
        <p>
          "Can I at least get your phone? I need to let STREET know that I'm
          still alive."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't have a phone."</p>
        <p>I stopped short, blinking at him. "Who doesn't have a phone?"</p>
        <p>"Me. Are you slow?"</p>
        <p>"How do we contact help?"</p>
        <p>"In some situations, you must be all the help you need."</p>
        <p>
          He shoved the key into the ignition, and the moment the engine roared
          to life, we heard a shout. "Hey! <i>kto ty!"</i> <i>who are you!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I froze. My blood ran cold, and shivers flowed down my spine in weaves
          as my gaze locked with Elio's.
        </p>
        <p>"Russians?" we said at the same time.</p>
        <p><i>"YA nashel ikh!"</i> <i>I found them!</i></p>
        <p>
          "Shit! Go, Go, Go, Go!" I practically jumped on the seat as the men
          fell back from shooting, rushing towards us and firing shots at the
          car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio stepped on the gas and maneuvered the car out of the maze,
          hitting some of the other vehicles as we finally got out, cutting into
          the road with blind speed; the vehicle bounced a bit, swerving from
          left to right, Elio holding the steering wheel, muscles clenching as
          he tried to steady the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          With one hand, he adjusted the rearview mirror, glancing at it. "We
          have company,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sweet," I exhaled sharply, getting his gun from the console where he
          had dropped it earlier; I cocked it and then proceeded to set mine
          too. "Almost out of bullets on this," I said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Glove compartment." He said, expertly taking over some cars. One hand
          working the steering, the other working the gear, focus dead set on
          the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          The road, thankfully, was a little bit free; other cars around swept
          by with speed, not wanting to get in the crossfire of the chase.
        </p>
        <p>I glanced in the side mirror, seeing the cars chasing after us.</p>
        <p>
          I reached for the glove compartment. "Why do you always assume there's
          something in the glove—oh."
        </p>
        <p>
          Two packs of bullets and a gun sat there, and I nodded. "Impressive."
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you."</p>
        <p>I clicked on the car music.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing?"</p>
        <p>"A little music; it helps me focus."</p>
        <p>"It doesn't help me." he gritted out.</p>
        <p>"Your problem."</p>
        <p>
          Familiar music blasted through the speakers, and a smile curled on my
          lips as I bobbed my head. "The Russian dude knows good music. Hello
          Cherry Bomb by The Runaways, Oh Dog is going to freak when I—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He gave a sharp turn, and I held my seat to keep in place, shooting
          him a glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Motherfucker," I muttered, shaking my head, and taking my weapons
          with me, all three guns and the bullet packs, before stumbling to the
          back seat.
        </p>
        <p>"Again, what the fuck are you doing?"</p>
        <p>
          "Shooting through the windows is a bit inconvenient. They're not
          shooting yet, which means I have the element of surprise. And I have a
          good aim."
        </p>
        <p>I caught him shaking his head. "Tell me when to duck."</p>
        <p>
          "I might." I taunted, raising the gun to the rear windshield, and
          fired three shots at it. The cracks invite me to break through, which
          I do, by hitting the gun to the fragile glass and watching it shatter.
          The wind whipped at my face immediately, blowing my hair all over my
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned, reloading the bigger gun, seeing our chasers lose composure
          for a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hello, boys," I said, aiming the gun right at the tires, swiftly
          shooting the nearest car, which swirled to the side with a screech,
          the driver losing control.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my other hand, I grabbed the second gun, aiming at their
          windshields as I blasted bullets at them, and they drove unfocused,
          turning and slowing down to avoid the attack.
        </p>
        <p>Two cars were tailing each other.</p>
        <p>
          I moved to the side, shot at one of their mirrors, took his attention
          off the road, and then aimed directly at him with the second gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blood splattered, and the car behind, not anticipating the unconscious
          turn of the vehicle, slammed into it, and it went tumbling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, Left!" Our car turned left and missed the other car's tumble by
          mere seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crash was massive, and unfortunately, some innocent cars got
          involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are we clear?" Elio yelled, and I grabbed the guns, going back to the
          seat beside him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, cut to the market at the next intersection; it leads to the
          highway, they'll regroup in no time, but we can shake them off that
          way."
        </p>
        <p>Elio glanced at me. "You're awfully excited."</p>
        <p>"I am."</p>
        <p>He shook his head, focusing on the road again. "You're demented."</p>
        <p>I nodded with a grin. "I am."</p>
        <p>
          He cut through the intersection, driving a few distances before
          entering the market. People were out, all right. It was busy, with
          sounds of chatter and music in the air as people shopped while some
          got out of the way, seeing our bullet-designed car—speaking of
          bullets, they ricochet in the air once more.
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking, Russians." Elio cursed.</p>
        <p>
          I reloaded. "Like a fucking bone in the throat," I added, angling
          myself towards the window, and shot back at them. "Get out of the
          way!" I yelled to people as Elio stepped on the gas again, knocking
          out some shops by the road. "Get out of the fucking way!"
        </p>
        <p>It was fucking chaos. My gaze shifted to the side mirror.</p>
        <p>
          "Duck!" I yelled to Elio when bullets came flying into the car from
          behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Still think breaking the rear windshield was a good idea?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Shut up!" My adrenaline spiked high.</p>
        <p>
          I risked shooting out the window again, getting my aim right as I
          fired at the car's front tire, missing the first time but getting it
          right on the second try.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pursuer's car lost balance, ramming into a store, but another one
          was on our tail, bypassing the one that lost balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guy was quick, firing three shots at once. Two missed me, and the
          other would have gotten into my arm had Elio not turned at just about
          the right time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit," I cursed, pain sweeping past my arm as I got into the car
          again, blood oozing from the wound.
        </p>
        <p>Elio's gaze shifted from the rearview to me. "It got you?"</p>
        <p>"A graze."</p>
        <p>He groaned in frustration. "Can you handle the wheel?"</p>
        <p>"Not as good as you."</p>
        <p>"Can you handle the fucking wheel, Sport."</p>
        <p>"Yeah,"</p>
        <p>
          Quickly, he left control of the car, and we switched positions with
          mild difficulty, and briefly, just briefly, my mind acknowledged that
          we—kind of— worked well together.
        </p>
        <p>
          He worked the guns with ease, entering into his element. Then he
          paused, staring at the weapon in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck are you doing?" I held the wheel steady, eyes
          alternating between the market road and him.
        </p>
        <p>He sucked in a deep breath. "Slow down."</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>He looked at me. "Slow down." His voice was calm, too calm.</p>
        <p>
          I slowed down, and he angled his body to the window, completely
          exposing himself while aiming the gun at our attackers, concentration
          lining his brows.
        </p>
        <p>One shot.</p>
        <p>Two shots</p>
        <p>Three shots.</p>
        <p>Chaos ensues.</p>
        <p>
          From the review mirror, I caught the cars behind us ramming into each
          other, and then there was fire; people were screaming, fighting to run
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dread painted my stomach, making it dip with a sense of urgency and
          regret. I stepped on the gas, and our vehicle sped forward, my heart
          hammering as I tried to get us away before—
        </p>
        <p><i>Boom!</i></p>
        <p>
          I flinched at the explosion, and Elio slipped back to the seat,
          stretching his neck from left to right, looking like he hadn't just—
        </p>
        <p>
          Wasn't it—wasn't there another way? How many innocent people were
          caught in that explosion?
        </p>
        <p>
          The music from the speaker had long since stopped, probably damaged
          like the car was.
        </p>
        <p>
          I drove us out of the market, entering an unfamiliar road, the car
          steady again. Quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know how long we drove for, but I felt my body calm down from
          the adrenaline.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at Elio to see that he still held the gun in a tight grip.
          His knuckles were white, but he looked ahead with a calm expression.
        </p>
        <p>I concentrated back on the road, letting out a breath.</p>
        <p>
          We reached a highway, and the wind blowing inside the car, calmed my
          nerves as I drove.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trees littered the sides of the road, and I was pretty sure we had
          lost the fuckers.
        </p>
        <p>
          After what seemed like thirty minutes, the car started slowing down.
          Its movements were getting jerky like it wanted to fall apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, it slowed to a stop with a jerk. Headlights flickering
          off, the night enclosing us like a thick black blanket as the engine
          stopped, and quietness followed.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm guessing your phone is deep inside the water with Casmiro's car?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yup."</p>
        <p>"And no one knows where we are?"</p>
        <p>"Yup."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, his head falling back at the headrest as he closed his
          eyes, adam's apple bobbing up and down as he swallowed and cursed.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck."<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>Okay guys........</p>
        <p>Enjoy the update ;)<br /></p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>I DIDN'T</b> believe in scary bedtime stories.</p>
        <p>
          No, this isn't because Miss Grace seldom told us these stories before
          bed. It was mostly because of how fake they seemed to sound and how
          impossible they mostly were. Being very curious at a young age, I
          would stand in front of a mirror and chant, 'Bloody Mary' three times,
          waiting to see if she would appear to take me away.
        </p>
        <p>
          And sometimes, I would stand by the floor-to-ceiling window in the
          hallway, waiting for the lady in white to flicker by the roadside.
          Most times, in the middle of the night, I'll get up from the bed and
          get on all fours, looking underneath my bed, trying to catch the
          monster.
        </p>
        <p>But they were always silent.</p>
        <p>
          Maybe they didn't come for children like me. Maybe they reserved their
          terrors for the children always driving by inside the yellow school
          bus every morning and afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd stopped asking these questions a long time ago, stopped seeking
          answers to my wonders because I grew up and knew there was no such
          thing as animalistic monsters. The real monsters were human beings
          like me, and they hid in plain sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know why my thoughts had walked down this lane, but there was
          no doubt that it had to do with the darkness around us, the sound of
          crickets, and the chill that came with the air of midnight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was the first to get out of the car, and I followed suit. No
          other vehicles were passing by, and the road seemed like a dead end
          from where we stood, so I was guessing we would have to walk a great
          distance before we found a convenient mobile store or even a motel;
          while I could stomach the walk, I wouldn't deny that my limbs ached
          from the stress of everything we've just gone through.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a shaky breath, hugging myself, as I walked around the car
          to Elio's dark figure at the other side. The moon gave us light, but
          it still somehow managed to cast shadows over his features.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Walking or waiting out here for a travel vehicle would be careless.
          Not when we have the Russians on our tail." Elio stated.
        </p>
        <p>"I thought we lost them."</p>
        <p>
          "We stole their vehicle; it's only a matter of time before they find
          us. We're calling it a night."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted on my feet. "I'm all for...calling it a night, but there is
          literally nothing out here for miles, and I don't reckon you have any
          money with you?"
        </p>
        <p>"We don't need money to start an open camp in the woods."</p>
        <p>I almost choked on my saliva. "I beg your pardon?"</p>
        <p>
          "You're not deaf." He said, already walking toward the tall trees that
          cast shapeless, wary shadows. A shiver ran down my spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he noticed I wasn't following, he stopped, turning to me. "Are
          you coming?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "I'm quite good where I am. I'll wait for a car to
          fly by and hitch a ride."
        </p>
        <p>
          I could feel his eyes roam up and down my body as He walked back
          towards me, determination in his strides. He stopped a foot away.
          "Stay here, and die. Follow me and survive on a maybe; you should be
          smart enough to know a good choice there."
        </p>
        <p>"The woods aren't exactly safe too."</p>
        <p>
          "They are, for the night. By morning, we'll leave because they'll
          likely double back when they don't find us at the nearest motel." He
          informed. "When they're on their way back here, we'll be on our way to
          the compound."
        </p>
        <p>"The car is literally parked outside the woods." I pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          "Where has your smartness run off to, Sport? The key is in the
          ignition, the two front tires are lessening by the second, and the car
          is bent to a very odd angle. It's obvious that it broke down, and the
          two people previously in it had hitched a ride or walked to the
          nearest motel because there is obviously a tracker in the vehicle we
          should be running from."
        </p>
        <p>
          My brain caught up to what he was insinuating. "Nobody in our position
          would stay behind instead of running away, okay, smart...But what
          about the painting?"
        </p>
        <p>"We're leaving it underneath the seat."</p>
        <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
        <p>
          "It's not safe to take it along. And we're not stupid enough to leave
          it behind either."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you saying? What if they check the car? Listen, I risked my
          damn neck for that painting, and I got a bullet graze which hurts like
          a bitch because of it. There's no way I'm letting them find it after
          all the trouble."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Risks are better than consequences. Carry the painting with you, and
          lose your only life leverage. On the off chance that we get found out
          by whomever these people are, they'd kill us and take the painting,
          but if they find us without the painting, two things. They can kidnap
          and torture until we deliver updates as to who has it and who doesn't,
          or we make a bargain. And I have a gut feeling they won't waste time
          searching the car when we are supposedly with the painting and would
          never be as foolish as leaving it behind."
        </p>
        <p>"But—"</p>
        <p>
          "We are doing the exact opposite of what anyone should do in our
          situation. I will not ask you to trust me because it isn't a foolproof
          plan, but I will ask you to follow my lead on this. I am never wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gritted my teeth, looking around the lonely area before my attention
          settled on him again. "Fucking fine. You might take the '<i
            >never let them know your next move thing' </i
          > to another level, but I admit you have a point."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm glad your brain still works. You had me worried there for a
          second."
        </p>
        <p>"You don't have to be rude."</p>
        <p>
          "That was not me being rude, merely observant." He said, turning
          again, and this time I followed him.
        </p>
        <p>"And here I thought you were a man of action and fewer words."</p>
        <p>"I am."</p>
        <p>"Well, you talk an awful lot when I'm around."</p>
        <p>
          He let a few beats pass before he responded. "That is a new behavior
          from me. One I'm still trying to understand."
        </p>
        <p>
          I snickered. "It's okay; I have that effect on people. It's like one
          of my charms."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio released a short, frustrated breath, not saying anything after
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          We walked inside the woods with only the light from the moon to guide
          our path. I had made a comment about getting lost, but Elio had simply
          pretended he didn't hear me, walking like someone who knew exactly
          where he was going. My joints ached, and the pain on my arm from the
          grazing was numb due to how tired I was. I could feel fatigue catching
          up to me, but I willed myself to remain alert.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio did know exactly where we were going because we reached a
          clearing in the woods. The space looked like an area where people
          would drop their camp tents and huddle around a fire.
        </p>
        <p>I shivered slightly due to the cold as we stopped.</p>
        <p>
          "We'll settle here for the night. I'll get some woods and start up a
          fire." He said, glancing around until his gaze settled on me with a
          pause. "You're cold."
        </p>
        <p>"If you haven't noticed, it's freezing out here."</p>
        <p>
          "No, it's not. It's what happens when you wear a nightgown out of the
          house."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not a—" I paused, doubling back with the conversation. "you know
          what? fuck you; I own what I fucking wear out. Nightgown or a fucking
          lingerie, it is my choice."
        </p>
        <p>
          He took me in, something dark passing through his stare. It made the
          grey in his eyes seem darker as He advanced toward me, like a predator
          approaching its prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, standing my ground and raising my chin as he stopped
          before me. "Look at you, Zahra." His said, voice barely above a
          whisper, an edge to it that had my stomach sinking; flashbacks of
          moments before he pushed me into that pool plagued my mind, but I held
          firm, refusing to let him intimidate me. "Dressed in the most
          revealing outfit," he continued, "alone in the woods with a man like
          me, a man who tried to drown you...a man who shot you, a man that
          wants you dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          He took one more step, closing whatever distance between us. I sucked
          in a breath, one that was filled with his scent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one is here; I can do..." his eyes searched my face. "anything I
          want to. You could scream, and no one would hear you or rescue you.
          You are wounded, tired, bruised, and weak, entirely at my mercy. I
          won't try to control what you wear, no. I have no care in the world if
          you decide to roam the streets naked. All I'm saying—is I have eyes; I
          see how attractive you are and how you love to flaunt it on occasion,
          but one thing you should never do, is be careless. And Right now,
          Zahra, you are. Being here with me this way is the most careless
          you've been.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're smart, but you lack wisdom. You know how to protect yourself
          from people who threaten you, but you do not know how to protect
          <i>yourself</i>." He said, leaning away from me as he took off his
          trench coat, wrapping it around my body before his gaze locked with
          mine, and he spoke. "I could have been anyone else." He stepped away.
          "Stay here. I'll get woods for a fire."
        </p>
        <p>
          When he left, I let out a long breath; it was shaky and cold, but I
          quickly slipped both my hands inside the arms of his trench coat,
          hugging it to my body; the warmth gave the distinct feeling of how
          intense it felt to be standing close to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I do with every piece of advice I have ever been given, I held on
          to his, seeing my mistakes and making sure never to repeat them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was...confusing. His threats somehow managed to seem like advice,
          a warning, and a guide at the same time. He had no reason to stick
          with me at this point, he could have gone on his way, but he was still
          here, and I doubted it was because he wanted to know what was really
          in the painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't delude myself and think he was here because it was kind of
          the right thing to do. According to past actions, it was safe to say
          that the man wanted me six feet underground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reason I could think of right now was Devil. He was sticking
          around because his brother would want that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, looking around me, trying to find a stone or wood to sit on.
          My legs ached, and it didn't help with the fucking heels on my feet,
          walking atop branches and dead leaves with heels was horror on earth;
          I wouldn't even wish it upon my worst enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found a few stones and pieces of bamboo sticks and created a
          miniature sitting material just before a tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat down and rested my back against the tree, the roots supporting
          my sitting material as I tried to get as comfortable as anyone could
          in a situation like this. I rested my head against the tree, sighed,
          and closed my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know how or when it came, but I knew that at some point, I
          allowed my body to succumb to sleep, losing consciousness in a sweet
          zap.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The sound of cackles from a fire and the distant howling of what
          sounded like a wolf had me jerking awake, my brain confused for a
          moment before I remembered where I was. The smell of burning wood and
          wet earth lingered in the air, and opposite me sat Elio, gaze steady
          on the dancing flames.
        </p>
        <p>
          I relaxed back against the tree, ensuring I didn't make a sound while
          I moved, not wanting to draw his attention because he seemed very far
          away from this space, and I couldn't help but watch him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't have any mask on; That was the first thing I noticed. He
          didn't wear a blank look or that of indifference...rather, he
          looked...sad and tired. There were dark circles underneath his eyes,
          very visible. His hair seemed slightly wet, like he had washed it, and
          I wondered if a lake was nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, and he blinked away from whatever daze he had
          been in, gaze rising from the fire to me.
        </p>
        <p>"How long have I been out for?"</p>
        <p>
          His gaze shifted from me back to the fire. "Four hours." He said.
          "It's 5 AM now. We'll leave at daylight; you can go back to sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat up, stifling a yawn, feeling more refreshed. I didn't know time
          would go by like that. It didn't even feel as though I slept for that
          long.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," I said, hugging his coat to me and maybe sniffing it a little
          because it smelled good compared to the smell of wet grass. "I'll keep
          watch. You should get some sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          Without looking at me, he added more wood to the fire. "There's no
          point. I can't sleep." He spoke. "It's already morning."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You look tired. You've kept watch all night. Why didn't you wake me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "There was no point." He repeated, and I watched him in the silence
          that followed, wondering if I should let my questions out or keep them
          to myself, but I was very curious, and the worst he could do was
          ignore me, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, waiting a few beats before speaking and breaking
          the silence with a question. "Why did you hesitate?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze flickered to me, and I took that second to appreciate how
          pretty his eyes were. His eyelashes made the color even more
          pronounced, designed to draw you in and keep your attention. When he
          looked back at the fire, he responded with his own question. "I don't
          understand your question."
        </p>
        <p>"You hesitated before you caused the explosion. Why?"</p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched. "I told you. I wasn't in the mood to kill anyone."
        </p>
        <p>
          I still wasn't getting it, so I pressed. "I don't understand you. You
          literally kill people all the time."
        </p>
        <p>"I do?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Seriously? You tried to kill me a few days ago."</p>
        <p>
          "I had a reason to. I don't kill people without a valid reason. I
          don't hurt people I don't know."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed. "You're fucking delusional. What about the families of the
          people you killed? Did you know them?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He went silent, and I thought he wouldn't answer until he...did. "No,"
          he said. "But I know grief. I danced with it. Lived with it. I kill
          them for their sake. The grief of losing a loved one is...
          brain-damaging. No one deserves to go through that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "That is a very twisted reasoning, Elio. You can't
          just choose to kill innocent people because you think you're saving
          them."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "I know; that's why I don't shoot anyone without a valid
          reason. If I do shoot, I don't shoot to kill. The healing scar on your
          shoulder is proof of that. If I need someone dead, I have people
          around me who can do it. Well—unless I'm in a mood, then, you can
          guess the rest."
        </p>
        <p>"So...all those people yesterday..."</p>
        <p>
          "It wasn't my intention." He filled in. "I'll pay for it one way or
          another."
        </p>
        <p>"What does that mean?"</p>
        <p>
          He raised his gaze to me again before looking away, not answering the
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          When silence came again, I had the urge to fill it. I don't know, but
          I wanted to lighten the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know...it's not your fault. I believe in reason. Everything that
          went down yesterday happened because it was meant to. No matter how
          bad it was. If we weren't there, somehow a fire would have started,
          and there would still be an explosion, maybe even worse than the one
          we caused."
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, when he looked up, he didn't immediately look away. He just
          stared at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt my stomach dip with the feeling that came with his stare, and I
          sucked in a breath, swallowing to ease my suddenly dry throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio nodded. "Hm." He let out before looking away, adding wood to the
          fire.
        </p>
        <p>"Was that a moment?" I asked.</p>
        <p>He frowned, side-eying me.</p>
        <p>
          "Did we just have a moment there?" I repeated, keeping my tone light.
        </p>
        <p>"No," he stated.</p>
        <p>"That was definitely a moment; I know a moment when I see one—"</p>
        <p>"Do you ever shut up?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes..." I let a soft edge enter my voice, calling his attention. He
          fully looked at me now, waiting for me to complete my statement. "Only
          when there's a dick in my mouth."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," he moved to stand and walk away from me, and a laugh bubbled
          out of my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait, wait... sit down," I said between laughs. "I was just fucking
          around. Calm your tits, Dad."
        </p>
        <p>
          He settled back down, shaking his head. He didn't smile, but he didn't
          look annoyed either.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where's your sense of humor? If STREET were here, they'd get the
          joke. God, I miss them. They'd make it seem like we were actually
          camping out for fun and not running from people who want our heads."
        </p>
        <p>He didn't say anything to that.</p>
        <p>I rested my hand on my cheek, watching him.</p>
        <p>"Do you have friends, Elio?"</p>
        <p>
          I don't know why I asked that...or why I wanted him to talk to me?
          Probably because I couldn't just stay fucking silent.
        </p>
        <p>Where's the fun in silence?</p>
        <p>
          "I mean, aside from Casmiro...like outside your whole syndicate
          circle...do you have a group of friends from, like, college? Oh, and
          you said you were in the army for a year? Did you have friends there?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His brows drew down as if he was thinking, and then he locked eyes
          with me briefly before speaking. "Who would have wanted to be friends
          with a man who murdered his whole family? Besides, friends are another
          level of weakness. When you have friends, you're open to betrayal,
          inessential drama—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Less loneliness." I cut in. "I could totally be your friend if you
          stop trying to kill me." and then I backed up. "Why even are you
          trying to kill me?"
        </p>
        <p>"Many reasons." He answered.</p>
        <p>
          "What—I wasn't the only one who stole from you, yet you singled me
          out. I don't see you trying to drown Milk, Dog, or Upper, and we've
          registered the fact that Devil joined STREET of his own free will."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You created it. If you hadn't—" he stopped, frowned as if he
          remembered something, and then sighed and completed his statement.
          "—He would still be here. In Italy."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, so it's not Devil—"</p>
        <p>
          "You still manipulate him, and you will eventually end up hurting him
          when he finds out you're not whom you say you are."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Devil and I aren't in a relationship. He's my best friend, and I know
          little about him, just like he knows little about me; it's mutual."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, there's the fact that you seem to be too skilled for STREET.
          You've only caused me headaches since we met, and you have managed to
          disobey direct orders, undermine me in front of my people, and act
          like you have once obtained the same role as me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He wasn't wrong. "That's basically my personality. You want to kill me
          because of my personality?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Then..."</p>
        <p>"You talk too much. You make me talk too much."</p>
        <p>"Talking is good, but that's not reason enough to kill me."</p>
        <p>
          "I just don't like you...your presence...it's—for reasons best known
          to me, I'd prefer you dead. Let's leave it at that."
        </p>
        <p>I tsked, shaking my head.</p>
        <p>"Why do <i>you</i> want me dead?" He asked.</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "You shot me, left a scar on me. Nobody does that and
          lives. Because of Devil, I'm lenient. Getting your name on my shit
          list would only take one action. I hope, for both our sakes, your name
          never gets on it."
        </p>
        <p>"There it is, that tone. It's why I want you dead."</p>
        <p>
          I laughed, eyeing him before relaxing back on the tree. "Get used to
          it, Dad. It's not going anywhere."
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't respond, and I no longer tried to fill in the silence. I
          closed my eyes, replaying the whole conversation in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's personality confused me, and I could feel my obsession to fix
          things tingle, but I reigned it in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite all he had revealed, he was still The Wicked. He still shot me
          and tried to drown me. He couldn't be trusted.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, I was proven right when I woke up to a bright day, the fire
          quenched with light smoke erupting from the ashes, and the man in
          black was nowhere to be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cursed, got to my feet, and called out his name, but I got no
          response.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't just leave me here, did he?</p>
        <p>
          I looked around and noticed the morning fog dissipating and the sun
          rising in the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Motherfucker," I muttered with a grit, shrugging the trench coat off
          my body in anger and stomping on it. "That bastard."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned on my heel the moment something sharp wheezed past me,
          landing with a soft thud on a tree. I turned sharply, squinting my
          eyes to see a small red syringe—A sharp pain prickled my neck, and I
          quickly moved to pull out whatever it was before bringing it to my
          view—
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, fuck me."</p>
        <p>
          I lost control of my legs and fell straight to the ground. Dizziness,
          tugging at my eyelids as echoing footsteps reached my ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my blurry vision, I saw them dressed in all black, with masks
          covering their faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them bent down and took off their mask...I spotted a grin as he
          said. <i>"Jal jada,"</i> <i>Sleep well. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I might be crazy, and my knowledge of that language might be rough,
          but that sounded so much like—Korean for...sleep, well?
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision blackened, getting in and out of focus, but I heard someone
          else speak.
        </p>
        <p>"Geunyeoleul ango gaja." <i>Carry her; let's go.</i></p>
        <p>
          It was too late, but it dawned on me that the Russians weren't the
          only ones hunting for that painting...
        </p>
        <p><i>What the fuck have we gotten ourselves into here? </i></p>
        <p>
          And then I felt my body lift from the ground, and I was thrown over a
          shoulder, the earth, zooming in and out in a stomach-turning way. My
          tongue was heavy, my body numb, and I finally...finally gave in to the
          darkness.

        <p>The little 'moment' between Zahra and Elio?</p>
        <p>
          Do you think Zahra and Elio could be friends if they weren't enemies?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it just me, or is this twisted chihuahua beginning to get annoying,
          cause it was so meaningless at first. Cause like--first Russians, now,
          Koreans? Who's next?
        </p>
        <p>Do you think Elio left her there for real? </p>
        <p>
          We're approaching zone spice real soon, just endure the drama for a
          little bit. (Trust me, I'm frustrated too.)

          Random thingy: Do you know that 70% of you guys called Zahra SPORT

          <b>CONTROL, UNPREDICTABILITY,</b> and the ability to make decisions
          for the sake of the greater good have always been my strong suit. It
          was why I had lasted so long in this business, in this world. I didn't
          throw temper tantrums; I didn't do things incapable of benefitting me;
          I didn't go off script. I was always ten steps ahead of a situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there were ever an instance my skills to predict failed me, I'd
          take two steps back, analyze the situation, and follow the most
          propitious route even though the consequence might result in agonizing
          discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was one of my father's many lessons drilled into my skull growing
          up. Those particular lessons were hard to forget. I'd watched my
          father support several people, make promises and make them believe
          they could never find a better ally elsewhere. And I had also watched
          him plant a bullet in the back of their skulls as soon as they turned
          to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father was a cunning man. He taught me to be one too, and maybe
          sometimes I did take it to the extreme, but only when it was
          necessary. He did tell me to be just like him, but better.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Marino's were betrayals who couldn't be betrayed, and we made it
          in such a way that our victims would never know who betrayed them by
          being the very victim in the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example. The ugly but priceless chihuahua painting. It didn't look
          like much, just a square framed blue and grey picture of a chihuahua
          with too-wide-eyes, a crooked mouth, with her head bent to an odd
          angle, a head I'd had the pleasure of patting once...many people
          wouldn't believe it—but that chihuahua, though odd-looking, was one of
          the sweetest pets that had ever gotten to grace this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arturo Garza, the owner of the chihuahua, a dark-skinned burly man who
          was so untouchable to the point that he had the pleasure of dying at
          an old age, had been quite influential during his reign. This man knew
          everyone who was anyone. He could answer any question with the right
          incentive—a nutcase on his best days—but I still admired him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? He had been the mastermind of all masterminds. There was also the
          fact that he was the first man my father had cowered in front of. I
          was eighteen when we first traveled to Mexico to find him. Then, I
          didn't know why, but my father had said Arturo was a man never to be
          crossed; he said he could squash us with just a snap of his finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we got to Arturo's manor, my father had been sweaty and shaky.
          Though I waited outside, I could hear my father's angry voice, yelling
          at Arturo, trying to intimidate the man, but the man's response was
          always leveled, not shaking or losing composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father had opened the door, and I caught a glimpse of Arturo, a
          cigar between his lips and a small dog in his arms; our gazes
          connected before the door closed, and my father pulled me out with
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the way back, my father had been spinning with anger, and I had
          just watched him. Feeling some peace from seeing him so unsettled,
          when he had caught me giving him that look, he had walloped me across
          the face, asking me what was so amusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I told him nothing. But I knew I had found a weakness; his
          downfall was atop my palm.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 26, a few years after I'd taken over Marino, I had taken a trip to
          Mexico, seeking Arturo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man recognized me, and the dog perked up at the sight of my
          figure, tail wagging from left to right. I had crouched down, patting
          her. I liked her; she was odd but confident.
        </p>
        <p>
          She reminded me of what freedom felt like, and I temporally forgot
          where I was at the moment until Casmiro discreetly kicked me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up, catching Arturo's interested gaze as he ushered me to his
          study.
        </p>
        <p>
          He told me I was the first to look at his dog for over a second.
          <i>"People are always threatened by things they don't understand."</i>
          He had said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been right. At that point, he sounded so wise. He made me feel
          comfortable enough to ask him anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had gone straight to the point. Telling him I needed his help to
          pull my family's name to the ground. I needed his information on us to
          do it myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, I had taken him by surprise because he had stared at me
          like I was from a different space and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he asked me why, I told him I wanted to see that look again—the
          one my father had worn after exiting his home.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a question in his eyes that clearly asked how possible it was
          to compel a facial expression from someone who was supposed to be
          dead. He didn't ask it, however. It didn't need to be asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arturo had taken a deep breath and told me he would have loved to help
          me, but he had his own plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I asked him what his plan was, and he told me I would be informed when
          everyone else was informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment I received a letter after his death, two years later, I
          registered the man as a crazy person. But I understood his motives.
        </p>
        <p>
          His dog had been his only family, and everyone avoided it like the
          devil's spawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          What other ways to seek justice for the chihuahua than having people
          hunt for it like it was their salvation?
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he had an artist paint her. Created a map. Turned every single one
          of his assets into gold, Roughly 50 million pieces of solid gold. He
          gathered dire information he had gotten about five of the most
          prominent mafioso families and five world presidential bodies, turned
          them into software copies, and placed them into custom-made flash
          drives. Then, he duplicated the painting into 100 pieces, Inserted a
          map to find the gold, and those flash drives, inside the frame of the
          original artwork, and then he distributed them around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mysteriously, Arturo and his dog were found dead in the manor, and a
          few seconds later, the quest was sent out to everyone who was anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was his way of making people hunger for the painting of his dog;
          the dog they feared and made fun of, was now the very thing they had
          to find to get their hands on the gold...and those flash drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although 99% of the people gunning for the painting were there for the
          gold, only a few like myself needed those flash drives, this was
          because people who were hunting for the gold, had no clue about the
          flash drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, whoever found the original painting first, gets the gold,
          the flash drives, and the key to being as powerful as Arturo was in
          our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultimate power. The final key to my puzzle. I'd find it. Let my
          father know that I had achieved the power to make anyone bend to my
          will. I would dangle what could have been right in his face.
        </p>
        <p>Then I'd burn it all.</p>
        <p>
          A waste. But I was a psychopath. And psychopaths like me only cared
          about that final goal—no matter whom I must destroy on the way to get
          it.
        </p>
        <p>The chase for the painting only made it more... enjoyable.</p>
        <p>
          The moment Zahra mentioned the painting in that supply closet, I hoped
          she was talking of another chihuahua, even though I knew pretty well
          it was the same one perilous people were looking for. When she showed
          me the picture, it took everything in me not to snap her neck right
          there, kill the rest of STREET, and send Elia far away from the chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I reigned it in and didn't let anything show by schooling my
          thoughts and acting with disinterest because I knew the painting that
          would be showcased was a fake. I had checked even before it was
          decided to be put out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people who sent them to retrieve it had cheated them. But I would
          have done the same. There were so many fakes and one original.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these paintings was treated with equal attention and
          importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear how Arturo had achieved all that he desired and more
          through this ridiculous quest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more the paintings were released, the more crafty and dangerous
          people got in on the quest. A decent example of this was how we were
          ambushed and how curiosity had made Zahra fight to keep the painting,
          to get in on whatever it was about.
        </p>
        <p>I knew I was close to finding it. I felt it in my gut.</p>
        <p>
          This was precisely why I couldn't afford any distractions. Zahra
          Faizan being one of them—no—being the root of the distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was unsettling. I had changed many plans to accommodate her
          presence quite a number of times. She killed Dion, which made me
          strengthen my association with Pablo instead of the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I wanted to ruin that association, I knew the death of Dion
          would garner more chaos than I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I said, I loved to be ten steps ahead, but she made me take ten
          steps back.
        </p>
        <p>That won't do.</p>
        <p>
          I couldn't kill her. But that didn't mean I couldn't let her get
          herself killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having left the clearing to get the painting and bring a car to get us
          back to the compound, I genuinely didn't think there would be such a
          huge turn of events.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been asleep when I left, and I couldn't bring myself to wake
          her. Sleep was a luxury I didn't get to have in abundance. I admired
          people who could do it without restlessness and the need to make it
          permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The walk back wasn't too long. I'd stopped at the nearby lake to wash
          my hands and face, feeling so dirty that my skin itched.
        </p>
        <p>
          On getting to where the car broke down, I stopped when I saw a white
          van by the side of the road, a small distance from where I stood.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shoved both hands into my pocket when I caught movement at the
          corner of my eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaning casually on the SUV, I watched about five men in black
          clothing and masks emerge from the woods towards the van.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them held an unconscious Zahra over their shoulder, and the
          other quickly opened the back of the van where they filed in, dumping
          her body like a piece of rag.
        </p>
        <p>
          They spoke in another language. I couldn't hear much from the
          distance, but I knew it was a language I didn't understand, and
          neither did I care to.
        </p>
        <p>
          They locked the back doors, started the engine, and swiftly drove
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood there for a couple of minutes, just watching them disappear
          down the road.
        </p>
        <p>Well...it's not as if there was anything I could have done?</p>
        <p>
          I leaned off the SUV, grabbed my gun from the console, and shoved it
          into the back of my pants.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, I was getting in a red open-roof beetle, hitching
          a ride with a blonde who looked at me like a meal she wanted to taste.
        </p>
        <p>I politely ignored it.</p>
        <p>
          "I gotta admit," she started, her voice sweeping with the wind, blonde
          hair flying all around, but was tamed by a small scarf. "When I left
          my house this morning, the last thing I expected was to give someone
          as unreal as you a ride."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned in genuine confusion. "Unreal?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          She nodded with a grin. "Yeah...you got pretty eyes, a pretty face,
          and that body, whoosh." She glanced at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like compliments, they made me uncomfortable, but the least I
          could do was to be nice, seeing as she was giving me a ride. "Thank
          you," I responded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn. How are you hot, with a rough edge that screams walking red
          flag, and also manage to be cute at the same time."
        </p>
        <p>Should I thank her again?</p>
        <p>"You got a girlfriend?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          She glanced at my fingers, inhaling a short breath. "A wife then."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "I like your fingers and the rings." She said, and I turned to look at
          her. Her teeth hooked on her bottom lip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then turned back to look at my fingers, turning them back and front,
          trying to find what was so special.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last time I had been with a woman—that was...I tilted my head to
          the side, my thoughts trailing as I tried to remember when or what
          she'd looked like...ah yes, she was Chinese; I was on a trip to China
          a year and a half ago. She told me how much she liked my fingers, it
          was weird, but I let it pass because, She had been beautiful, but the
          thing that had drawn me in was her hair. Long, black, and healthy, I
          was very impressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sex was wonderful, but being with someone whom had you wondering how
          it would feel to touch them, was more blissful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at the blonde. "Thank you; I like rings; they're...a
          mystery."
        </p>
        <p>She chuckled. "Like you."</p>
        <p>"Hm." I eyed her again. "I like your hair."</p>
        <p>
          That startled her a bit, and her cheeks pinked. "That's sweet, thank
          you."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, looking away.</p>
        <p>"You know you give off the vibe of a serial killer, right?"</p>
        <p>I slowly looked back at her. "Do I?"</p>
        <p>
          "Dude, you're hot, dressed in all black, standing by the side of the
          road at the ass crack of dawn, you've got this mysterious aura, and
          you talk like you're testing out the words before you say them; you
          have this odd, calmness to you...it's kind of unsettling."
        </p>
        <p>"Yet, you offered to give me a ride."</p>
        <p>She glanced at me, and shrugged. "Maybe I have a death wish."</p>
        <p>It was silent for a few beats.</p>
        <p>"I'm Mar...I'm Elio." I broke the silence.</p>
        <p>She smiled. "I'm Gemma."</p>
        <p>
          "Put your mind at ease, Gemma; I have no reason to kill you. I just
          needed a ride."
        </p>
        <p>"Glad I could offer it."</p>
        <p>
          She was still chatty as we drove, talking about how she was taking a
          road trip in three days because her grandmother wanted to experience
          it before she passed, and then she spoke about her grandmother, who
          was her only family. She asked me about my family, and I told her I
          had none.
        </p>
        <p>It wasn't far from the truth.</p>
        <p>
          I was pretty dead to Elia at this point. And my father, well...he was
          a dead man walking—sitting—rather.
        </p>
        <p>
          We arrived at a convenience store a few minutes later, and I told her
          I'd find my way from this point. I wished her and her grandmother well
          and watched her drive off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I passed the gas station in front of the store, seeing two cars packed
          and getting fuel; before I walked into the building, a few people here
          and there were buying things for the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking up to the counter, a guy in a beanie with headphones around
          his neck eyed me wearily. My gaze shifted to the phone in his hand.
          "Can I use your phone? I need to make a quick call."
        </p>
        <p>
          He blinked before slowly outstretching the device to me wordlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," I said, dialing Casmiro's number. I had just three phone
          numbers stored in my head. Casmiro's, Angelo's, and the contact in Los
          Angeles. The one I used to keep tabs on Elia.
        </p>
        <p>
          He answered the call.
          <i
            >"Before you say anything, I want you to know that I will never
            forgive you for hurting my baby. Destroying her like that."
          </i>
          his voice rang through, and I was pleased that he knew off the bat
          that it was me. He knew I would find a way to contact him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Glad to see you had a comfortable night in a comfortable bed,
          Casmiro. My night was fine, too; I spent it in the woods, very
          comfortable, sleeping underneath the open sky. I didn't miss my bed,
          and I was far from danger. Did you have breakfast? Because I didn't,
          and I've just remembered that I didn't have dinner. How wonderful the
          last 24 hours have been for the both of us."
        </p>
        <p>He sighed in resignation. <i>"Are you okay?"</i></p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Good, I found your artist. Where are you? I'll send people over."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "No need for that. I'll be at the compound shortly; I have somewhere
          else to visit."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Where's Zahra?" </i></p>
        <p>
          My fingers drummed against the counter. "She got kidnapped about an
          hour ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a slight pause as if he was trying to detect a joke.<i>
            "What?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. It's none of my business; I'm sure she can handle herself." I
          flexed my fingers. "Hopefully, she can't and does me a favor by dying.
          I don't really care. Are you making sure STREET is—"
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a clash at the other end of the line. I frowned, hearing
          muffled noises like silent grunts of,
          <i>'You can't just barge in—give me my ph'</i>—and then a dull thud.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Where the fuck are you? I'll come get her myself."</i> Elia's
          voice rang through, and my blood ran cold.
        </p>
        <p>"Where's Casmiro?"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"We knocked him out. What the fuck, Elio? We lost connection with
            you both, and we've been locked in all night. No news. And now you
            say she's kidnapped, and you don't fucking care?</i
          >" A strained noise left him at my silence. "<i
            >Just give us a location, and we'll find her and get her ourselves."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, grounding my teeth together. "I lied to Casmiro.
          Zahra's safe with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a small pause. <i>"Does he think we're stupid?"</i> that
          sounded like Dog.
          <i
            >"We heard everything you said to Casper over here, you
            motherfucker. The idiot had the phone on speaker while we tried to
            break in."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>My gaze shifted to the transparent doors of the store.</p>
        <p><i>"Where is she, Elio." </i></p>
        <p>
          "With me. She's outside getting fuel; I'm in the store getting a
          cigar." I said, watching the white van move beside a fuel stand. A
          masked man in black hastily rushed out to fuel the van.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew it was empty now, and he was the only one inside the Van; no
          one was in the passenger's seat. They'd dropped her off somewhere—at a
          site or a nearby safe house. Who fucking knows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, closing my eyes as I rubbed the space between my
          brows.
        </p>
        <p>The luck backing this woman is...</p>
        <p>
          "We'll be back soon. I do not want to see Casmiro hurt. If I do,
          you'll be sorry." I took the phone from my ear, blocking and deleting
          the number, before handing it back to the boy, who was now staring at
          me with wide eyes. "Do you have cigars?"
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head wordlessly.</p>
        <p>"What do you have?"</p>
        <p>"Cig—cigarettes."</p>
        <p>I hated cigarettes.</p>
        <p>
          "How can you not have cigars?" I sighed, rubbing my neck in tiredness.
          Then I gestured hastily with my hand. "Give me the cigarette."
        </p>
        <p>He rushed to fish for a pack, placing it on the counter.</p>
        <p>
          I picked it up, watching the van as I took out a stick, placing it
          between my lips while I checked my front pocket for a lighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flicked it on and placed the flame at the end of the stick until it
          settled, and then I flicked the lighter close, shoving it back in my
          pocket before sucking in the smoke and blowing it back out.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you believe in luck?" I asked the boy while watching the van.</p>
        <p>"Huh?" he squeaked out.</p>
        <p>
          I turned to him again, shoving my hand inside my other pocket and
          pulling out a small bundle of thousand-dollar notes. I counted out
          five, placing them on the counter before returning the rest.
        </p>
        <p>"Luck, do you believe in it? Do you think it exists?"</p>
        <p>His jaw was dropping at the sight of the money on the counter.</p>
        <p>"Um...I guess?" he said.</p>
        <p>
          "Hm," my gaze shifted to his side, and then I pointed to the baseball
          bat resting in the corner. "Is that yours?"
        </p>
        <p>He quickly looked to the side, nodding. "Yes, sir."</p>
        <p>"I need to borrow it. You can get yourself a new one."</p>
        <p>
          He blinked before quickly reaching for the baseball bat and handing it
          to me. It was strong enough, perfect on my grip.
        </p>
        <p>"Thank—"</p>
        <p>
          "Sir, this money is—even if I got a baseball bat with it and pay for
          the cigarette, it's still too much, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him. "It's for the phone bill too. Also, you need to
          stock the store with cigars, preferably flavored ones, in case I
          happen to visit again."
        </p>
        <p>He gulped. "Yes, I—thank you—I will—thank you, sir."</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, exiting the store after grabbing the cigarette packet and
          shoving it inside my pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked towards the guy in the mask as he closed the fuel tank and
          started going around the van.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey," I called, slipping the cigarette back between my lips.</p>
        <p>
          The moment he turned, I forcefully swung the bat to the side of his
          head. His body dropped to the ground, passing out on impact.
        </p>
        <p>I twirled the stick, nodding. "Perfect."</p>
        <p>
          Then I got in the van, started the engine, and proceeded to save the
          girl.

            reason, and while we have registered that he can still be saved, it

            lives up to, so please put that in mind as you read this chapter.
            Like I said in the CAUTION chapter, there will be character
            development, but it might take time. (soon, since we've come a long

          His gloved hand softly stroked my left cheek, warm and tender. His Hot
          breath fanned my face, and I shifted uncomfortably, dread tugging at
          my stomach.
        </p>
        <p>That voice...</p>
        <p>
          <i>"My Zahra..." </i>The side of his face brushed mine, clean-shaven
          and smooth, his lips hovered above my ear, and he whispered.
          <i>"Wake up."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes snapped open, pulling my consciousness to my irregular
          breathing.
        </p>
        <p>I was alone.</p>
        <p>
          I breathed a sigh of relief but stopped short when I caught the ground
          below me. It took me a few seconds to realize I was hanging from the
          ceiling. My arms ached, propped up, with my wrists tied to an iron
          ledge at the top, my heels weren't in sight, and my toes barely
          touched the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was still a bit dizzy from whatever drug they'd used on me, but it
          was not enough to numb the pain from my arm; the bullet grazing from
          the shooting was leaking blood again. I gritted my teeth, my hooded
          eyes going around the space. It looked like an empty shed, and I could
          tell we were well into the afternoon and approaching evening through
          the light sneaking in from the small window at the end. The walls
          around me were wooden; I could guess it was some safehouse, probably
          somewhere out of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, throat dry as I tried to relieve the aching from my
          joints. My toes curled and uncurled in an attempt to touch the ground,
          even if it was just for a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck..." I groaned, annoyance biting my inside with an intensity that
          had me feeling more awake and active by the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ribs ached from the strain, and I tried to twist my wrist free, but
          whoever tied the damn knot knew what they were doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though it ached, I swung myself back and forth three times before
          lifting my lower body and then my upper one. I only lasted about three
          seconds before my body dropped in a painful protest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ground my teeth together, holding in the sharp pain that shot
          through the joints in my shoulders at the drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I had been hanging here for a while with the pain I was in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Voices had my head perking up, my breathing hard as the door opened;
          two men in black walked in, one rolling in a table with what looked
          like an electrical torture machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, come on, for a chihuahua painting, really?" I asked, my voice
          tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the guys approached me while the other rolled the table beside
          him. The one watching me had a buzzcut and a brutal healed scar
          slashing from his brow to his cheek. His lips were lifted in a snare.
        </p>
        <p>"Hi?" I voiced, swallowing again.</p>
        <p>
          "You have a mouth on you," I could hear the Korean accent over his
          English intonation.
        </p>
        <p>"Doesn't everyone have a mouth on them?"</p>
        <p>
          His hand roughly gripped my chin, twirling my face from left to right.
        </p>
        <p>
          "See something you like?" I asked. "Is it the freckles? It's always my
          freckles—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The back of his hand swung, connecting with my cheek in a hard slap.
          My head whipped to the side at the force of the hit, and I tasted
          blood on my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          I licked it off and mixed it with my spit before turning to the
          buzzcut motherfucker; he was smirking at me. "Learn to keep that mouth
          shu—"
        </p>
        <p>I spat on his face before he could complete that statement.</p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes, pausing a few seconds before slowly digging his
          hand into his pocket and bringing out a handkerchief, wiping the spit
          off his face. He opened his eyes again, this time with a glare that
          had me wondering if he would kill me now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other man turned on the machine, clearly pissed at how I'd
          insulted Buzzcut.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My boss was right," Buzzcut said, throwing the handkerchief away.
          "You are her."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, my thoughts freezing for a second. "Her who?"</p>
        <p>"Martino's whore." He said.</p>
        <p>
          My breathing spiked; blood ran hot. "I don't know what you're talking
          about. Who's that?"
        </p>
        <p>"You want to play dumb?"</p>
        <p>"Bitch, I thought I was here for the painting?"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, you are," he stepped back and picked up the naked plugs from the
          table, rubbing them together, causing a spark.
        </p>
        <p>My eyes remained on him as he walked back to me. "Hey listen—"</p>
        <p>
          He pressed the naked plugs to both my ribs, and my body shook
          violently, the electric current flowing through my body. A strangled
          groan left me, and he drew back the plugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My breathing was short, and I felt warm all over, too warm. "Well," my
          lips trembled. "That's one way to shut me up."
        </p>
        <p>"Martino Conti sent you to find the painting; why?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Who the fuck is Martino Conti—" The plug was back on my ribs, and my
          body shook again, my teeth pressing together as I tried but failed to
          suppress my groan. He released me again, and I gasped out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This time, I want you to answer me with the truth; I will increase
          the voltage if you don't."
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a shaky breath, my body growing weak with each passing
          second. This is what happens when you're literally being electrocuted
          without not having to have eaten anything or drank any water for
          hours—no strength to withstand torture.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was paid five thousand fucking dollars to retrieve the painting for
          an unknown buyer. If this person is Martino Conti, whoever that is, I
          don't know them. No names were given when I passed information across
          to them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know your face. I know you know him. And he sent you. Word is out
          that he is on a hunt for the painting too. But my boss is curious
          because Martino Conti doesn't care about gold. So, there must be
          something else, and we want to know what it is."
        </p>
        <p>What the fuck?</p>
        <p>
          "Gold? There's gold in the painting?" I asked, my surprise rocking
          some strength back into my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't act like you don't know." The man sneered, brushing the naked
          plugs together.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know, okay? You don't think I was fucking surprised when I
          was sent five thousand dollars to retrieve that ugly painting? I
          thought I hit the jackpot, but now you're talking about gold? I was
          fucking cheated."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nobody gives a fuck if you got cheated. We want to know why Martino
          Conti wants the painting. What else is there with the gold?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, confusion gripping me, but I held firm. "Who the fuck is
          Martino Conti? Whomever you think I am, you've got the wrong girl."
        </p>
        <p>"Increase the voltage." The man said with a no-nonsense tone.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm fucking serious; I don't know what you're talking abo—grhhhhh."
          My body shook again; I felt the sharp painful, blood-draining zap from
          my head to the sole of my feet, my toes curling, the strain on my
          arm—so fucking unbearable.
        </p>
        <p>
          He released me again, and my body sagged, my head dropped, and my
          breathing grew faint.
        </p>
        <p>His hand came underneath my chin, raising my head.</p>
        <p>"Talk now, or I kill you," he said.</p>
        <p>
          I smiled, then a chuckle left me, and then a laugh, though weak, still
          sounded like I was deranged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I licked my bottom lip. "What do you think, Buzzcut, that you'll shock
          me a few times, then I'll what—cry and tell you all I know about
          Martino Conti?"
        </p>
        <p>
          An unsettled look flashed in his eyes, making my smile widen as I
          said. "You don't know who you're fucking with. I humbly suggest you go
          back to your boss and tell him to leave Martino to his business."
        </p>
        <p>"So, you admit you know him."</p>
        <p>
          I didn't respond, and his eyes scanned my body from head to toe. "You
          admit you're his...whore?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My jaw clenched as he dropped the plugs, his finger coming to trace my
          jaw, down to my collarbone, then to my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand formed a tight fist above me as I tried to level my breathing.
          "Get your <i>fucking</i> hands off me." I gritted out
        </p>
        <p>"What does Martino Conti really want with that painting?"</p>
        <p>
          I leveled him with a glare. "I don't know, and even if I do know, I
          sure as fuck won't tell you."
        </p>
        <p>
          His fingers trailed down to the swell of my breast, and I jerked away
          from his touch. "I swear to fucking God, I will chop your fingers off
          one by one if you don't fucking keep them to yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          He laughed. "Making threats when you're tied to my ceiling." Then he
          looked at the other guy, who had a crooked smile on his face "Michin
          yeoja."<i> Crazy woman.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Try me," I said, and both of them stopped laughing, attention back to
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buzzcut looked like he was seconds away from snapping my neck.
          "Millions of gold bars are not enough for Martino Conti to send people
          out for the painting. You know something. Not just, Martino, my boss
          suspects other families are on the hunt for it. What we don't know is
          why. Surely it can't be gold; these people are richer than sin. What
          else aside from Gold connects with the painting."
        </p>
        <p>I fucking wish I knew.</p>
        <p>
          "As I said, stay the fuck out of Martino's business because if he
          doesn't hunt you for meddling, I will."
        </p>
        <p>
          He smirked, and I watched his hand travel down my cleavage, but before
          he could wander further down, I raised myself again with every single
          strength I could muster and slammed my knee upside his face.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck!" He held his nose, bouncing in pain. "You fucking bitch—"</p>
        <p>My body dropped, and a whimper of pain escaped me.</p>
        <p>
          A loud clash from outside got their attention. There were shouts and
          grunts of pain and loud, unending, piercing gunshots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buzzcut and the other man exchanged a look at the chaos that seemed to
          have erupted outside.
        </p>
        <p>My joints curled on tight when the shooting lessened.</p>
        <p>
          "Go check," Buzzcut said to the other man, voice strained while he
          nursed his nose, and the other guy left his position.
        </p>
        <p>The shooting stopped completely.</p>
        <p>
          I briefly wondered what the hell was happening, but I stopped
          wondering when the door to the small shed barreled open, a baseball
          bat swinging right to the face of the other guy who had been
          approaching it to go check.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guy went down immediately, disoriented, as Elio swiftly twirled
          the stick, holding the handle and jamming its end into the man's face.
          He went out like a light.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then he looked up, face stained with violent sprinkles of blood
          that I knew weren't his own, red splatters dotting from face to
          neck—he was wearing a button-up, which meant he did leave me to change
          his shirt? The sleeves were rolled up to his elbow, revealing dots of
          blood on his forearms and the hand that held the baseball stick.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grey eyes moved from Buzzcut to me. His gaze swept up and down my
          form, completely expressionless while he stood there, looking like a
          fucking psychopath who just survived the zombie apocalypse before he
          settled his gaze on Buzzcut, who looked like he had seen a ghost, and
          though it was just a breath of a whisper, I heard him say...
        </p>
        <p><i>"IL MALVAGIO?" </i></p>
        <p>
          I could spot the moment when fear took over his form; he quickly
          grabbed the plugs again, increasing the voltage to the highest as he
          aimed it at me.
        </p>
        <p>So...a death wish, got it.</p>
        <p>"Don't come any closer, you—you come close, I fry her." He said.</p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze fell to me again before drawing to the buzzing naked plugs
          and then back to Buzzcut.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," Elio's deep voice rang through as he pressed the head of the
          baseball stick to the ground between his legs, both hands holding the
          edge as he spoke. "Go ahead."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You think I'm bluffing?" Buzzcut said, inching the plugs close to my
          ribs, eyes sharp. "I will fucking do it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's expression didn't give anything away. "Was there an invisible
          stutter to my previous statement?"
        </p>
        <p>Buzzcut swallowed but didn't make a move to do anything.</p>
        <p>"Are you going to do it, or should I approach."</p>
        <p>
          My insides tied knots around themself. If Elio had really wanted me
          dead, he wouldn't be here, but why the fuck is he urging this fucker
          to fry me?
        </p>
        <p>
          A few beats passed, with just Elio staring intently at Buzzcut. When
          nothing was done, Elio nodded, lifting the stick, and started stepping
          forward, but the moment he did, Buzzcut found his senses again, about
          to press the naked plugs to my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was one second away from being electrocuted to death, but it seemed
          as if that one second was enough for Elio to reach behind him, whip
          out a gun and aim it right at Buzzcut's head, pulling the trigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buzzcuts blood splattered on me, and the plugs clattered with him as
          he fell to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>He just...killed someone.</p>
        <p>
          Elio dropped the stick, gun still in hand as he approached; somehow,
          he didn't look at me. Not even once. He just went straight to the
          machine supplying currents to the plugs and then turned it off; when
          he did, the silence stretched, and he finally raised his gaze, locking
          it with mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes still weren't giving anything away as he came to stand right
          in front of me now.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't say anything, and neither did he.</p>
        <p>My breathing was embarrassingly loud, while his was controlled.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes swept between mine as he finally spoke. "Well, Sport, how's
          it hanging?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed out a weak laugh. "Wow, how long did it take you to come up
          with that one? Real original."
        </p>
        <p>"It is?"</p>
        <p>"Very."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm glad. The moment I saw you hanging, my brain immediately searched
          for a befitting response to your condition."
        </p>
        <p>"Really? I'm happy you're finally learning to give a good sass."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. It seems the negative influence you have on my brother is
          beginning to rub off on me."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe we spend too much time together."</p>
        <p>"Maybe."</p>
        <p>
          And then silence fell again, his eyes lingering on mine before falling
          to my cheek and then my lips. "Are you okay?" he asked, lifting his
          gaze to mine again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As okay as a person hanging from a ceiling for hours could be," I
          said.
        </p>
        <p>"Right."</p>
        <p>
          He came closer to me; his warm, firm body brushed against mine while
          his arms went around the back of my thighs, a little below my ass; as
          he lifted me so that I wasn't leaning on my own weight anymore, I
          suppressed my sigh of relief when he untied the knot on my wrist and
          placed me back on my feet, which was bare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped my arms, my body pressed flushed against his, with his arms
          still around me.
        </p>
        <p>Our gazes locked again. "You can let me go now," I said.</p>
        <p>
          I lost my balance the moment he did, but he snaked his arms around me,
          pulling me back to his body. "Steady," he said; somehow, his voice had
          grown soft, or maybe I was just reading too much into the gesture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my hand against his chest, feeling his muscles beneath my
          palm as I pushed slightly. "I can stand on my own; I'm not a damsel in
          distress."
        </p>
        <p>His eyes roamed my face. "I did just save you."</p>
        <p>"I was handling it well on my own."</p>
        <p>
          "You were? It's odd, but I seem to remember untying you a few minutes
          ago."
        </p>
        <p>"I would have untied it myself, even if you hadn't shown up."</p>
        <p>
          He was still holding me. "A little thank you doesn't hurt, Sport."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have nothing to thank you for, Dad," I pushed away from him,
          standing on my own two feet, ignoring how I felt less warm, being away
          from his body. "You left me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not exactly. I would have returned for you if you hadn't kidnapped
          yourself."
        </p>
        <p>I blinked at him. "So, you saw them taking me away."</p>
        <p>"I did."</p>
        <p>"And you didn't do anything?"</p>
        <p>
          "This is ludicrous and will never happen in the foreseeable future,
          but would you have stopped them from taking me away if you were the
          one in my place?"
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't answer because, yeah, he was right.</p>
        <p>
          "There's my answer. Come on, I have somewhere to be, and we need to
          look at your arm before returning to the compound." He said, walking
          past me to the Buzzcut guy on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>"Did you shoot anyone outside? The gunshots—"</p>
        <p>
          "They shot themselves while I used them as human shields. Broke a few
          faces with the baseball bat. The usual."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned when he bent, fishing his pocket for a handkerchief; he
          covered his hand with it as he searched Buzzcut guy's body until he
          recovered a wallet and pulled out an ID card, examining it before
          slipping it into his pocket and throwing the wallet back on Buzzcut's
          dead body.
        </p>
        <p>"Let's go," Elio said, brushing past me.</p>
        <p>
          I followed behind him. "You didn't take that ID card because you want
          to—" I stopped short when somebody came rushing through the entrance.
          The boy was in the same uniform as the other guys, but he had a
          striking resemblance to Buzzcut, mainly because his hair was also a
          buzzcut. He didn't look like he was more than 16; he looked...younger.
        </p>
        <p>
          His frantic eyes swept past Elio and me to Buzzcut's dead body, and he
          screamed. <i>"abeoji!" Father!</i>
        </p>
        <p>Elio's gaze swept between Buzzcut and the boy.</p>
        <p>No...No...</p>
        <p>"Elio don't; he's just—"</p>
        <p>
          The shot rang through before I could even complete that statement; the
          boy's body dropped to the ground with a crumbling thud, blood leaking
          from the wound on his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood in shock, my body completely frozen, as Elio slipped the gun
          back into his pants. "Come on,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't move. I couldn't bring myself to. I felt sick to my
          stomach, wondering what the hell just happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio stopped, turning to look at me, my gaze still on the boy's body.
        </p>
        <p>What the fuck.</p>
        <p>What the fuck.</p>
        <p>What the fucking fuck.</p>
        <p>
          A groan left Elio, and I caught his figure approaching from the corner
          of my eyes as he reached me. "I don't have time for this," he said,
          grabbing my good arm and pulling me with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head was cloudy, the sound of the gunshot still ringing in my ear,
          even as Elio reached a black car and opened the door, pushing me
          inside the passenger's seat, and rounded the car to the driver's side;
          I stared into nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car started moving, and as we drew farther and farther, my
          breathing became sharper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once on the familiar highway, I felt myself being unable to breathe
          properly. My hands were shaking, and thinking was beginning to feel
          difficult...The torture, the lack of food, the shocks from the naked
          plugs, and then this...what I just witnessed was unthinkable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man had just—he had just killed a kid...he was—I can't—I can't—
        </p>
        <p>"Stop the car,"</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>"Stop the car, now."</p>
        <p>"I don't—"</p>
        <p>
          I picked up the gun he'd dropped from the console and pointed it at
          the side of his head. "Stop the fucking car, or I'll blow your fucking
          brains out."
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at me, a look of annoyance glazing through his eyes as he
          navigated the car to the side of the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment he stopped, I was dropping the gun, getting out of the car,
          taking a lung full of breath, and pacing back and forth as I filled my
          lungs, my fingers raking through my hair in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck, fuck." I chanted, trying to calm myself.</p>
        <p>
          The sound of the car door opening and closing had me looking up at
          Elio, who came to stand outside, leaning on the side of the car bonnet
          in my direction as he watched me before fishing his pocket for a
          cigarette and a lighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lit it and put everything back in place while he sucked in from the
          cigarette between his fingers, blowing out the smoke and watching me
          like he was trying to figure me out. There was no remorse in his form,
          almost like he hadn't just shot a kid dead.
        </p>
        <p>"You didn't have to kill him," I said, my voice heavy with anger.</p>
        <p>"I did."</p>
        <p>
          I was thrown back by how direct he sounded—like—like he was in the
          right. "What the fuck—he was just a fucking child! He was innocent!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He brought the cigarette to his lip, sucked it in, and blew it out
          calmly. "Sins are passed on from a parent to a child as long as they
          share blood. People need to live much better lives, so when they meet
          their fate, their families wouldn't have to pay for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took steps closer to him now, poking at his chest. "That. Is
          fucking. Bullshit! It's bullshit twisted in a way to only make sense
          to you!"
        </p>
        <p>"I know."</p>
        <p>"Yet you still fucking do it!" I yelled in exasperation.</p>
        <p>
          Irritation pulled down his brows. "It had to be done. If they die,
          anyone who shares blood with them dies too."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, for the love—says who?!" I yelled.</p>
        <p>
          "Says me!" he yelled suddenly, and I had to step back momentarily. He
          wasn't one to lose his cool, but he just did. He threw the cigarette
          to the ground and closed the space I had created, getting into my
          face. "It is my fucking law, and if you keep running your mouth like
          this, you and your blood relatives will share the same fucking fate.
          You know them, or you don't."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh please—"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't be a hypocrite, Zahra. I have seen you kill people without a
          second thought. You don't think they have family somewhere who would
          grieve them?"
        </p>
        <p>"That's different!"</p>
        <p>
          "How is it different? Because they're above fucking twenty? A life is
          a fucking life, no matter how old they are."
        </p>
        <p>
          My breathing was harsh as I shook my head, looking at him with a
          newfound hatred. "I hate you; I have never hated anyone as much as I
          hate you."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>"You will rot in hell."</p>
        <p>"I know."</p>
        <p>
          "The world will be a much fucking better place without you in it!"
        </p>
        <p>"As I have devised."</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to pull my hair out at how unfeeling his voice was. "You're a
          fucking murderer! A fucking psychopath and serial fucking killer, a
          sick unfeeling fucker! A twisted monster! Child murdering bastard—"
          his hand gripped my throat as he switched our positions and slammed my
          body against the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you're beginning to get on my nerves." He seethed out, eyes a
          deadly mask of anger and something else I didn't even care to put a
          name to.
        </p>
        <p>I tried to struggle out of his grip, but he held firm.</p>
        <p>
          I ground my teeth together, looking him dead in the eyes. "I will kill
          you. Mark my fucking words, Elio, you've just made it to my shit list.
          Watch this fucking face because it would be the last thing you see
          when you breathe your last."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm honored to have made it to your list, but I already called dibs
          on killing me. Genuinely sorry to disappoint."
        </p>
        <p>
          I stayed silent, my eyes searching between his, his words loosening in
          my head, the meaning clear as fucking day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Get off me!" I yelled, pushing at him, and he let me go, stepping
          away with his eyes still dead set on mine. "You're fucked up," I said,
          straightening. "I knew you had a few screws loose, but boy, are you
          messed up in that fucking head of yours."
        </p>
        <p>His jaw clenched as he shoved both his hands into his pocket.</p>
        <p>I raked my hair from my face, and his eyes followed the movement.</p>
        <p>
          "You're so gone beyond redemption, and you can't even see it, Elio," I
          said, shaking my head. "Devil deserves better than having you as the
          only family left. You don't deserve him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Old news." He said, but his brows twitched, eyes hardening, showing
          how my words had hit him.
        </p>
        <p>Well—good fucking riddance.</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know what you think you're waiting for?" I stepped closer to
          him. "But you need to hurry the fuck up and get the fuck out of
          everyone's faces. No one needs your bullshit. Neither do they want you
          here."
        </p>
        <p>
          He remained silent for a while before he swallowed and responded.
          "Okay."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, shaking my head in disbelief before walking away from him
          and back to the car, hoping the boy's soul rested in peace for the
          terrible way he had died.

        <p>Words.</p>
        <p>
          They were simple alignments of letters to form something meaningless
          or meaningful, depending on how they were used.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'd think a man like myself would be accustomed to taking things in
          stride.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was impressionable; When it came to compliments, advice, or
          reprimanding. I couldn't help it. I was built that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was probably abysmal that I had to share this idiosyncrasy with a
          clinical depression that I never bothered to treat since I was
          diagnosed years ago. It was the same mental illness my mother had. The
          same one, my Father, had ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got symptoms, I'd hoped to God that I hadn't inherited it,
          seeing whom she became down the years, growing up...I was scared of
          what I'd become with the kind of hand I was brought up with.
        </p>
        <p>
          My childhood wasn't normal. It was replete with abuse, verbal,
          physical, and emotional abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd done things I would never forget or forgive myself for, things I
          had punished myself for.
        </p>
        <p>
          But sometimes, the punishment was never enough. Nothing was ever
          enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo would tell me to go for proper treatment, but there was no
          point in treating myself; I didn't deserve to get better, not after
          everything I had done in the name of revenge. In the name of care.
        </p>
        <p>Deep down, I knew I was just a sick bastard. I was delusional.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't know consequences. I grew up learning to forget the meaning
          of that word.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't care for useless emotions because I knew how my life started
          and how it would end.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no point in building relationships or dwelling on something
          less than its worth.
        </p>
        <p>There was no point to me.</p>
        <p>
          And fuck—have I been stalling this...for what? To make sure Elia was
          fine?
        </p>
        <p>
          He hates you, Elio. You fucked up with him. You abandoned him when he
          probably needed you the most.
        </p>
        <p>Where the fuck were you?</p>
        <p>
          When that fire started, where the fuck were you? When your siblings
          and your mother shared their last moments, what the fuck were you
          doing?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why are you stalling in the name of revenge...on the father who
          doesn't even give a shit—on some false delusion of a—a poetic justice.
          Did I even deserve that? The poetic justice?
        </p>
        <p>I'm a fucking joke.</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro had his own life, and Angelo had his own thing to deal with. I
          was alone with the books most of the time anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          A waste of space and valuable oxygen just to fulfill a promise made to
          a dead sister who probably would have wished for my death if she were
          alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until Zahra mentioned it about an hour ago, I didn't realize all I was
          doing was stalling. Because even when it comes to finishing this, I
          still couldn't do it.
        </p>
        <p>How fucking useless could I get?</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, gripping the steering wheel tightly, dark thoughts
          spinning and dancing around my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          They meant business this time. They were merciless. Uncontainable. I
          needed to be alone. Not here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I neared the drug store, itching to get out of the car—away from the
          woman beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I watched her get kidnapped, and I could have returned to the
          compound, ignoring Elia's attempts to get her back. I never did
          anything I didn't want to do. Maybe some part of me knew, one way or
          another, that I'd go back for her. It was probably why I didn't ask
          Gemma to drive me back to the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my periphery, Zahra's head rested against the window, but her
          eyes were trained on me.
        </p>
        <p>I refused to glance over.</p>
        <p>I should have known.</p>
        <p>
          I should have known she'd alter my streak from the moment she opened
          her mouth to talk back at me when we first met. I always stayed away
          from things that provoked unwarranted emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, she provoked curiosity in that torture room; anger in the board
          room; irritation and competitiveness with the chess game, regret on
          the rooftop, lust in the supply closet and the exhibit, impulsiveness
          in the car chase, desire, denial, and remorse in the woods...care in
          that shed...then acceptance and realization by the roadside.
        </p>
        <p>
          She made me feel useless emotions; somehow, I'd grown comfortable
          thinking I'd found someone like me. The more unrestricted, open-minded
          version of me
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing her kill without hesitation in that shoot-out, I
          was...impressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if I hadn't returned to find her after the amateur kidnapping, I
          was almost positive she would have found a way out of that position
          because <i>I</i> would have found a way out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere between the supply closet and the shed, I'd thought, maybe I
          wasn't the only one without morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out I was being delusional...Even <i>I</i> was fucked up to
          someone like <i>her</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I could totally be your friend if you stop trying to kill me."</i>
          Her voice echoed in my head.
        </p>
        <p>Guess now that's out of the option.</p>
        <p>
          I pulled into the parking lot by the drug store just out of town,
          turning off the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why are we stopping?" she asked, tiredness coating her voice as she
          stretched.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's a change of clothes in the back seat," I told her, unbuckling
          my seatbelt without looking her way; even though I could sense her
          stare at me, it was dark outside now. "By the side of the building,
          there's a washroom. You can freshen up; I'll get things for you to
          clean your arm wound; there's a local mobile restaurant near here;
          since you've not eaten anything all day, we'll stop by."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gaze shifted from me to the backseat, probably seeing the folded
          clothes and the fake chihuahua painting, and then she looked back at
          me. "When—when did you have time to get the clothes and check the
          area?"
        </p>
        <p>Leave the car, and ignore—</p>
        <p>
          "Before I reached the shed. I'll be back." I was already opening the
          door and getting out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made my way into the drug store, a mild headache paying a visit to
          my head as I picked out the little things she'd need to take care of
          the wound. I knew I was about to scare the person behind the counter
          due to all the dry blood on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or...I might be scaring the person humming and turning toward the
          shelf I was in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced in the voice's direction and frowned, doing a double take at
          who emerged, attention focused on pulling out a drug from one of the
          shelves.
        </p>
        <p>"Gemma?" I called.</p>
        <p>
          Blonde head snapped in my direction, her eyes widening as she froze,
          staring at me. Her gaze took me in from head to toe, surprise,
          confusion, and caution shining in them, but there was no trace of
          fear.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio? What a coincidence."</p>
        <p>"I don't believe in coincidences. Are you following me?"</p>
        <p>
          She blinked out of the daze she seemed to have been in. "No? My
          grandma and I decided to hit the road early. I'm refilling her
          meds...are <i>you</i> following me?"
        </p>
        <p>"No," I stated.</p>
        <p>
          She swallowed. "Is that...blood on you?" she eyed the things in my
          hand. "Oh my God, are you hurt? Or did you hurt someone, and now
          you're trying to help them? Are you—are you really some kind of serial
          killer?" she whispered the last part.
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>She nodded. "So...what—what am I looking at here?"</p>
        <p>'If I told you it was paint, would you believe me?"</p>
        <p>"Nope."</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "My..." I trailed off, wondering what the hell to refer to
          Zahra as. I couldn't exactly use hostage, friend, or woman like I'd
          used in that exhibit to get Grace off my back. So, I went with my
          generic answer when I didn't want to expatiate. "Someone I know is
          hurt."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips formed an 'O' as she nodded. The usual alarm bells of warning
          whenever I needed to be cautious, didn't go off in my head.
        </p>
        <p>This was probably just a coincidence.</p>
        <p>
          "Well...this must be the universe...maybe it wants us to exchange
          numbers." She said with a chirpy grin.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm covered in blood."</p>
        <p>
          "What does that have to do with numbers?" she said, fishing her purse
          for a phone as she approached me.
        </p>
        <p>"You're not scared?" I eyed her form.</p>
        <p>
          "If you wanted to kill me, you'd have done it earlier today." She
          outstretched her phone to me. "Type in your number."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't have a phone."</p>
        <p>
          "Ah...you're one of those types," I watched her search inside her
          purse for a pen and a piece of paper, and then she quickly scribbled a
          phone number on it, extending it to me. "There, you can text or call
          me whenever you get a phone?"
        </p>
        <p>"What if I never get a phone."</p>
        <p>
          "Then, if the universe wills it, we'd see each other again." Wide eyes
          shone with amusement.
        </p>
        <p>I doubt she'd ever see me after tonight.</p>
        <p>I lifted the paper.</p>
        <p>
          She walked backward, a teasing smile on her face. "If you do get that
          phone, don't be a stranger."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled, shaking her head and muttering, "So cute," before she
          turned and disappeared down the aisle, away from view... I memorized
          the number before slipping the paper into my pocket, continuing my
          hunt for the last item, which was cotton wool, and then I paid a
          frightened teenager and exited the store to the building out back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking into it, I trekked the short hallway to the female washroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my hand to knock. "Spo—" I stopped, closing my eyes for a
          second before opening them back up, my knuckle connecting with the
          door three times. "Zahra, I got the materials for your arm."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come in." Her voice was muffled, and I hesitated before twisting the
          handle, pushing the door open, walking in, and closing it behind
          me...the moment I raised my head, I paused, unable to stop my eyes
          from taking her in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hair was wet, and she wore the black sweatpants I had chosen. Her
          shoulders were naked, and her hand held the black sweatshirt over her
          chest in an attempt to cover her breast, but I could still see the
          swell, barely covered underneath her naked arms.
        </p>
        <p>I was staring. Of course, I was staring.</p>
        <p>
          She was the first woman in a year and a half who piqued my interest
          sexually.
        </p>
        <p>The reason why was still a mystery to me.</p>
        <p>
          I'd been in front of naked women countless times since then, and none
          of them had been able to compel even a glimpse of strain from my cock.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was shocking. I found her attractive. I find a lot of women
          attractive, but Zahra, while not my usual type, managed to challenge
          me in every way.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't like loud women. She was loud.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't like careless people. She was the definition of careless.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like people who talked back when they were not supposed to.
          She talks back—every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like women with short hair. She wore her hair short, though
          it always smelled excellent, pleasant to the point that I was
          impressed with the effort she put into it to make it smell—see? My
          thoughts derailed again.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was like me—except she held all the characteristics of myself that
          I habitually hid to keep up the façade that was my whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was scary. It intimidated me in a way I had never thought probable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked a challenge, but this time it came in the form of a woman I
          couldn't have. A woman I don't want to have. A woman who had finally
          told me the one thing everyone was thinking but couldn't say to my
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first challenge capable of making me take a 180-degree turn, to
          retrace my steps, and do what needs to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would have asked if you liked what you're seeing, but the last time
          I asked someone that question, I got a slap to the face." Her voice
          made me blink, pulling me back from my head—<i>Both my heads. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I approached her, taking my eyes away before placing the items on the
          counter. "That's all you'll need."
        </p>
        <p>
          This scourge of a woman wouldn't take her eyes off me, even as I
          turned to go back outside.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio," she called. I stopped. "Help me."</p>
        <p>"I'm assured you know your way around sewing your own wound."</p>
        <p>
          "I do, but not from this angle. I might do more damage than good."
        </p>
        <p>
          I ticked a muscle in my jaw, pulling on the blankest of blank
          expression that I could muster in her presence before turning to
          'help.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Without looking at her, I washed my hand clean in the basin, then put
          on the gloves I had gotten, cleaning the surface area of the cut.
        </p>
        <p>"You won't even look at me," she stated.</p>
        <p>
          I continued my work, ensuring the needles were sterilized properly
          before connecting them with her skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          She winced, and I glanced up, catching her stare, which was able to
          hold mine for about five seconds before I focused on what I was doing
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quiet for a while before she spoke again. "Fine," she snapped,
          sounding agitated. "Your whole quiet broodiness is making me feel like
          shit, so I'll be the bigger person and...and try to...and
          a—apolo—fuck. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that after you told me
          you wanted to off yourself, I was just tired and pissed because you
          didn't have to kill the kid, and you showed literally no remorse."
        </p>
        <p>I carefully put the third stitch, remaining quiet.</p>
        <p>
          My silence disturbed her; I could feel it by each passing second her
          words hung in the air after her forced apology.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So you're not going to say anything...maybe something along the lines
          of, you're right, I shouldn't have killed the kid?"
        </p>
        <p>I put in the fourth stitch, trying to block out her voice.</p>
        <p>
          "Listen...I never apologize to people, okay? So, this is kind of a big
          deal for me, being the bigger person, because I'm petty as fuck."
        </p>
        <p>I placed in the second to last stitch, concentrating.</p>
        <p>"Oh, come on, Elio, I'm trying here."</p>
        <p>"I have no use for your apology," I stated, my tone flat.</p>
        <p>
          "That's not what you're supposed to say to someone who apologizes to
          you."
        </p>
        <p>"I have no reason to acknowledge your courtesy."</p>
        <p>"Okay, your highness."</p>
        <p>
          The warm ick in my stomach had me losing focus for a second, and she
          flinched at one wrong movement from me.
        </p>
        <p>My gaze snapped to hers. "Fucking stay still, Sport."</p>
        <p>
          Her lips curved upward, drawing my gaze to them. "I'm perfectly still,
          Dad." She said, and I looked away, back to her arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          My blank look was a failure because I couldn't help a frown from
          drawing my brows together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her stare made me uncomfortable, as always. Not that I didn't like it
          when people looked at me, she just had this—thing where she lured the
          victim from her stare to reciprocate the action.
        </p>
        <p>It was unnerving.</p>
        <p>Her eyes...her freckles...her face. Fucking sinful.</p>
        <p>I avoid sins.</p>
        <p>
          Especially the ones woven into the body of a pretty face. I should
          have just let the man from earlier fry her. Since allowing her to get
          kidnapped didn't work due to my interference, my mission for tonight
          should rid me free of her. At least, that's one thing to look forward
          to.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For real, today has been a terrible day. I was legit shocked from
          direct electricity, and then your actions—but with all that, I'm
          trying to salvage this little partnership we've developed—"
        </p>
        <p>"Don't delude yourself."</p>
        <p>"Okay...friendship?"</p>
        <p>"We're not friends."</p>
        <p>"Frenemies?"</p>
        <p>I suppressed a groan. "Not that either."</p>
        <p>"Enemies, then?"</p>
        <p>"If I considered you an enemy, you'd be dead."</p>
        <p>"Okay...what do you consider me—"</p>
        <p>"Nothing."</p>
        <p>
          I finished the stitching, dropped the materials by the sink, and
          removed the gloves.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nothing?" she asked, doing that thing with her voice, the one that
          compelled attention.
        </p>
        <p>I fell for it...again. Pausing before looking back at her.</p>
        <p>A taunting smile played on her lips.</p>
        <p>She removed the sweatshirt.</p>
        <p>I dropped my gaze.</p>
        <p>Fuck.</p>
        <p>
          Piercings. Her nipples were pierced. Erect. Pink against full breast.
        </p>
        <p>Was I impressed by it? Yes.</p>
        <p>
          Is there an uncomfortable aching in my tongue and cock? Yes, which I
          concede is a normal reaction. Do I need this reaction? No. This was
          useless...this was...temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled the sweatshirt down her head, covering herself and raking
          her fingers into her wet hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my gaze again, catching a smile from her, her stare
          flickering from my eyes to the strain against my pants. She took two
          steps closer to me, just enough for me to get the now distinct
          distracting smell from her hair, enough for me to feel what warmth
          from her body would have felt like—enough to take me back to that
          shed, where her body pressed flush against mine.
        </p>
        <p><i>Elio...your thoughts are not helping. </i></p>
        <p>
          She tilted her head. "I admire your control, Elio. It makes me
          wanna...challenge it." then she subtly scrunched her nose to show her
          pending excitement for challenging my control.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her from underneath my lashes, maintaining a look of
          indifference.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll wait for you in the car," she said. "I could eat, and then we'll
          talk about today...don't take too long." And then she reached behind
          me, purposefully brushing her chest with mine as she grabbed the
          worn-out dress she had been wearing before heading out of the
          washroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I released a breath, closed my eyes, and moved my neck from left to
          right, willing for a semblance of control.
        </p>
        <p>It wouldn't matter...</p>
        <p>In a few hours, it wouldn't matter.</p>
        <p>Focus...<i>those piercings</i>...focus.</p>
        <p>I hissed, snapping my eyes back open and glaring at the wall.</p>
        <p>"Fucking Witch." </p>

          Your engagement on the last chapter SHOCKED me! I literally didn't
          have this chapter ready. And since you guys got the comments to one
          freaking thousand, I was up till the dead of night, writing like an
          EVIL MASTERMIND! I'm about to hit the bed now, cause I only slept for
          two hours, hehe, that's the fuel you guys pumped in me, thanks to your
          comments!
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget to vote and comment as you read this! I will appreciate
          all kinds of spam for this chapter!<br />

        <p>Enjoy the update ;)<br /></p>
        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>THE MOMENT </b>he entered the car again, all clean from the blood
          on him, he made it a point to avoid looking at me. I almost laughed at
          how adorable I found that action.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fed off attention and control. In whatever position or situation I
          found myself in, I always made sure the rein of control remained firm
          in my grip. Losing it would shove me right back into that scared
          sixteen-year-old girl—the spineless Zahra who chose the wrong person
          to hold her hand in the disguise of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last time I lost it was the first time I stood face to face with
          Elio, in that hot room, without a clue where the others were or what
          the man would do. His reputation wasn't the most promising, and we
          were all caught off guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I had a talent for cunningly taking back control, sometimes with
          my words and sometimes with my actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But damn hell, flashing him hadn't been my plan to get his attention.
          A part of me just wanted to see his reaction, and boy, was it
          priceless. His eyes had been lust, personified.
        </p>
        <p>It excited me.</p>
        <p>
          It shouldn't. It shouldn't because after I left that damn washroom, I
          felt guilt cloud my senses. What the hell would Devil think if he
          discovered this new development?
        </p>
        <p>
          He can't—I can't even broach the topic after he told me he wanted to
          talk to me about something. He can't know that I just flashed his
          brother to get a reaction out of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >And I can't like that reaction. I can't want this man beside me.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>But I do want to play with him.</p>
        <p>
          I was itching to tease him till he was at his brink. Not like I wanted
          to do anything after that, but God, that expression on his face when
          he walked in and then when he saw me half naked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The control that had been at the top of my palm. The reaction it had
          elicited.
        </p>
        <p>
          After leaving the clutches of those sex traffickers, I'd made all my
          sexual encounters ride on my terms. We share an equal say. Don't grab.
          Don't own unless I ask you to. I rarely do. The fear of giving my
          trust to a man and letting him take me was not something I liked
          experiencing. But damn it to hell if I didn't—somehow—like the way
          Elio had arrived at that shed and shot buzzcut, holding me firm to his
          body afterward.
        </p>
        <p>My pride seemed to have been non-existent.</p>
        <p>
          While I liked to be the one in control most of the time—My gaze
          shifted from the road ahead to Elio, who had an elbow resting on the
          window while his tattooed fingers rested on his cheek and his lips,
          his other hand controlling the steering wheel—I wondered how it would
          feel to be owned by a man like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to drive him to the edge, make him lose control, let go of
          the reins, and see what he would do to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had never wanted this...I will probably never go through with it
          because, well, Devil, but it wouldn't kill to wonder, would it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Minutes later, Elio pulled up at the mobile restaurant he had talked
          about. It was small, but a few travel cars were parked around.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So are we supposed to head in there and just ask for food without
          paying? You don't look like you have a phone or an ATM card."
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned off the engine before turning to look at me like he was
          confused and surprised that I'd asked that question. I just knew in my
          gut that he was about to respond with an indirect insult. The mock
          concern in his eyes was a dead giveaway.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm pretty sure we spent hours away from each other, and you seem
          like a person who has the ability to recall things, like the fact that
          this was not what I was wearing yesterday; who knows? Maybe after I
          left you with the Koreans, I went to get clothes for you and myself,
          and I never told you I didn't have any money on me if I recall
          correctly." He said all through with a cautious stare, one that made
          me feel like I was intellectually inept.
        </p>
        <p>"Well, at least you're talking to me."</p>
        <p>
          He blinked at me. Seconds passed before he shook his head, getting out
          of the car. I got out after him, following behind as he walked towards
          the restaurant entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spotted a payphone by the side, making a mental note to ask if it
          was still in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we entered, the smell of roasted beef and late-night greasy food
          met with my nostrils, and my stomach grumbled, hunger taking over my
          mind. There were people in booths here and there, but overall, the
          building had a cozy, secluded, homely feel. I just knew the food was
          going to be great too.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My God, I'm so hungry; it has been like years since I've stayed this
          long without eating—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll find a booth." Elio cut in rudely before walking away from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to my side to find a girl of about 17, watching Elio walk
          away; her eyes were wide open in what looked like surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That is an example of a guy you should avoid," I told her, and she
          snapped her head towards me.
        </p>
        <p>"Is that your boyfriend?" she asked, her voice eager.</p>
        <p>"No, he's not."</p>
        <p>"Oh my God, do you think I should get his number? He's so hot."</p>
        <p>
          I blinked at her, wondering if she had heard my remark about staying
          away from guys like that. She was pretty. Long brown hair curled to
          form beautiful waves, sharp and bright green eyes that showed how
          excited she was to have come across someone like Elio. Her clothes and
          purse told me she was probably a traveler and stayed in a motel
          nearby. Young. Naïve.
        </p>
        <p>"He doesn't have a phone," I stated.</p>
        <p>"Really? That's so mysterious." She chirped.</p>
        <p>"Right." I slowly looked away from the crazy girl.</p>
        <p>"I'm totally going to say hi!"</p>
        <p>
          I turned back towards her quickly; she was already barreling her way
          to Elio's booth. He had been wearing a frown, but it disappeared as
          soon as he saw her approaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched the interaction carefully. She spoke first, and Elio nodded
          at whatever question she had asked him. Then almost as if she had
          taken his response as an opening, she started gushing about something,
          and he listened attentively like he was interested in whatever she was
          saying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he seemed to stop and ask her a question, to which she nodded
          enthusiastically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curiosity ate at me, and I wondered why he was acting like he'd known
          the girl all his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though he didn't smile at her, his facial features were relaxed. It
          was a look I'd never seen on his face before.
        </p>
        <p>It was kind, approachable, and welcoming.</p>
        <p>A huge contrast to the person he was.</p>
        <p>
          After a few more back and forths between them, she reached for a
          handshake, which he took, and then she waved a bye and left, walking
          back towards me.
        </p>
        <p>I looked away before Elio could catch my stare.</p>
        <p>
          "If I were 20, I'd definitely tap that." She said as she reached me,
          resting her elbow on the counter and sighing. "He's so nice too. So
          dreamy. He complimented my hair. If he looks like that, I wonder what
          his brother will look like...is your boyfriend hot too?"
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "That's probably an inappropriate question, sorry. He told me you were
          seeing his brother."
        </p>
        <p>My brows shot up. "Oh! Yeah...um, kind of...yes."</p>
        <p>
          "Why are you out here with him, though...are you guys like doing the
          whole..." She leaned in, wiggling her brows. "Forbidden thing?"
        </p>
        <p>What the hell is she talking about?</p>
        <p>"Like cheating." She clarified.</p>
        <p>
          "What? No. There's no one to cheat—you know what, I'm just gonna order
          my food."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, sorry." She said sheepishly, giving me a small wave and an
          apologetic smile before she returned to ordering her own food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting behind everything that just happened, I ordered verities of
          food and sent them to the booth where Elio was before rushing outside
          to use the pay phone, which I had confirmed was thankfully still in
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          I borrowed a few quarters, assuring them the man dressed in black
          would cover it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering the phone booth, I placed a call through to Dog's private
          cell, and he picked up at the third ring.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Who the fuck is this?"</i></p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Zahra, what the fuck! You're not dead?"</i> His voice came with a
          twinge of relief and mock shock, and then I heard footsteps from the
          other end.
          <i
            >"Guys, she's alive. We can't use her bedroom for the orgy
            anymo—"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The was a quick scuffle, followed by Dog's protest, and then Devil's
          voice reached my ear. I relaxed back a little.
          <i>"Z, are you okay?" </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, I'm okay."</p>
        <p><i>"Where are you?" </i></p>
        <p>
          "Some restaurant out of town, but I'll be back soon. I was a little
          hungry."
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard him sigh.
          <i>"You had me worried—you had all of us worried." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt weighed heavily on my chest. "Sorry, you know me...getting
          kidnapped is kinda like my thing. Did you guys find anything about the
          painting? And why I was fucking abducted by Koreans? And why they were
          asking me about some...gold?"
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a mini silence before I heard Milk's voice from a distance
          saying, <i>"Put it on speaker." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Where are you calling from?"</i> Upper asked, and I knew from the
          lagging in his voice and the distant keyboard tapping that he was
          trying to track the device.
        </p>
        <p>"Some payphone?" I said, confused.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Hold on."</i> He said, and then there was complete silence, a
          little bit of static, and then. <i>"Can you hear me?" </i>his voice
          was clearer.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah? What's going on?"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"I hacked the device, this is a conversation that we're sure is
            being listened to, but we're good now."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Okay? So...I take it you guys know what's going on?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Yes,"</i> Milk said.
          <i
            >"Dog was able to find the location of the person who's been
            exchanging emails with us for months. We traced them to Australia."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We were chased by Russians, and I was kidnapped by Koreans. A lot of
          people want this thing." I said.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"It's fucking, Gold. Fifty fucking million bars, of course, people
            are gonna kill for it."</i
          >Dog responded.

        <p>

          Devil added.

          <i
            >"The crazy fucker made a bloody map, placed it in the original
            frame and made about like a hundred copies of the painting, and sent

            else."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"We haven't figured out what that something else is,"</i> Devil
          voiced,
          <i
            >"But if bosses of criminal families are also hunting for it, it's
            gotta be big."

        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Probably intel,"</i> Milk said.
          <i
            >"Ground-breaking intel is the only reason these men would want it."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "The power..." I said, "This is huge. People are getting informed of
          this quest every day. Forget the intel, and think about how many
          people out there killing to get their hands on that gold."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I want to get my hands on the fucking gold."</i> Dog said.

        <p>I chuckled. "Okay, guys, are we telling Marino?"</p>

          <i

          Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he had no reason to tell me even if he knew. "I'll go now;
          see you guys soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hung up, immediately making my way back into the building. I walked
          towards our booth, almost doubling over when I saw the food on the
          table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spaghetti with oil and garlic <b><i>(Aglio e olio)</i></b> sauced meat
          in a full bowl, spicy vegetables that smelled divine, three pieces of
          tomatoes and onion sauced chicken, and yummy-looking French fries to
          go with it. I was practically drooling at the sight, wishing I had a
          phone to take pictures and send to Dog so he'd cry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I slipped into the booth, rubbing my hands together as I looked over
          at the man opposite me, whose gaze was trained on the window beside
          him, arms crossed against his chest, lost in his own world. He didn't
          even look over when I arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dug into the food immediately, diving straight for the water first
          before picking up the fork, rolling the delicious pasta into it,
          shoving it into my mouth, and moaning at the taste. "God, fuck yes,
          this is so good."
        </p>
        <p>
          When he didn't turn my way, I lightly hit his leg from underneath the
          table, and he turned to me, raising a brow of inquiry. "You've got to
          try this; it's heavenly. Why didn't you order?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not in the mood to eat."</p>
        <p>"Do people have to be in a mood before eating?"</p>
        <p>"I am not people."</p>
        <p>
          I shoved another fork full of spaghetti into my mouth, speaking with
          my mouth full. "Did you stop by here to eat something when we were
          apart?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"So, you've not eaten all day?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          I grabbed a sauced chicken, tearing into it like a starved woman,
          knowing my mouth was as messy as my hands, seeing as Elio's blank
          stare had quickly turned into that of irritation as he watched me eat.
        </p>
        <p>Who gives a fuck? Not me.</p>
        <p>
          "You're not eating because you're ashamed to eat in front of people,
          are you? cause that's just pitiful." I said, one of my hands rolling
          spaghetti into the fork, shoving it into my mouth, while my other hand
          brought the chicken to my mouth, tearing a bite as I chewed the
          spaghetti and chicken together, melting at the combination and
          bouncing on my seat in appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>"You're an animal." He stated.</p>
        <p>"Stop flattering me; I might just fall in love with you."</p>
        <p>"That was not a compliment." He gritted out.</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, picking a sauced beef with one of the toothpicks, and
          yes—it tasted fucking good too. "I have this disorder where every
          insult I get materializes into compliments in my head; it's like—so
          rare and incurable."
        </p>
        <p>"There's no such thing."</p>
        <p>
          "Do your research," I said, digging into the vegetables and pasta to
          find what combination they would form in my mouth. "Oh yes," I threw
          my head back. "I'm having a literal food orgasm right now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio relaxed in the booth, shaking his head like he was done with me.
          I smiled inwardly; at least he wasn't looking out the window with that
          wary expression anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This place is perfect! They bring tradition into the taste of their
          food; Dog would love it here. I'll bring him some time to have food
          orgasms together."
        </p>
        <p>"You lack table manners."</p>
        <p>
          "No. I just love being free, not uptight and proper like you." I
          grabbed another chicken wing, waving it around him as I said, "I know
          there's a crazy in there somewhere; you just gotta let loose."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Like you let yourself lose to the extent of," his gaze flickered to
          my chest, "Piercing your nipples?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "There, there, is that what's bothering you, can't get it out of your
          head? Is it making you hard again? You should have looked away."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You didn't give me a choice. How did you sit through that? Who put it
          on you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Dropping the bone of the chicken wing, I smiled coyly at him. "A man.
          A hot, sexy, tatted, and pierced man. He was really good with his
          hands. His name was Julio."
        </p>
        <p>
          The man opposite me just shook his head. "Why would you put yourself
          through that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You got an opinion about my preferences; I don't wanna fucking hear
          it; my body, my choice."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not trying to give an opinion. It just looks painful, and I
          wondered why you would endure it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The pleasure that comes with it is worth it." I smiled, pulling the
          French fries towards me. "Besides, I was a sex worker, as you probably
          already know."
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned immediately. "They forced it on you?" The edge to his voice
          had me clarifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nope, I saw some other girls getting it; I liked it but didn't dare
          to do it then because I was young. But I did it after I left, one of
          the best decisions I ever made, and from your expression earlier, I
          could tell you liked it."
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't."</p>
        <p>
          "Pfft. Right, you didn't." I picked the glace of water, bringing it to
          my lips as I stared at him from underneath my lashes, ending my
          statement with, "But your cock did." I drank.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not talking about this anymore."</p>
        <p>I chuckled, dropping the glass. "You raised the issue."</p>
        <p>
          "It was clearly a mistake. You need to work on your conversational
          skills because, somehow, everything you say has to end in some sexual
          comment. It's worrying."
        </p>
        <p>"Aww, you're worried about me?"</p>
        <p>
          "No...you make me want to plant a bullet in my skull." He said,
          turning his head back to the window; his dull demeanor settling in an
          instant, like every conversation we just had, didn't happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the topic, sitting up and raising a new one. "So, The
          Koreans were asking for information about some gold. Apparently,
          there's a lot of gold to be gained by whoever finds the painting...."
          I said, gouging his expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hesitantly looked away from the window to me, looking indifferent.
          "Is that so." He stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed as I took a tasty seasoned beef into my mouth. "You knew,
          didn't you?"
        </p>
        <p>He didn't respond.</p>
        <p>"Why didn't you say anything?"</p>
        <p>"I had no reason to."</p>
        <p>
          "Seriously? I almost got shot because of a fake painting. That's
          enough fucking reason to."
        </p>
        <p>"How do you know it's a fake?"</p>
        <p>
          "STREET did some research, and they discovered all about the quest
          shit, the gold, and Arturo's little chihuahua."
        </p>
        <p>"Congratulations," he said.</p>
        <p>"You're so nonchalant about this. It's infuriating,"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay." He mumbled, looking out the window again. He looked like he
          was physically here, but his mind was elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can I have the ID card? The one you took from the buzzcut guy?" I
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without looking at me, he lifted himself a little, searching his
          pocket for the ID card and dropping it on the table.
        </p>
        <p>Just like that.</p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat. "Thanks. I still don't think there's any need to
          hunt down the rest of his family."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." He responded.</p>
        <p>Deciding to use Spanish, I asked. "Where's your mind?"</p>
        <p>
          He turned his head towards me, staring for a few seconds, also
          responding in Spanish. "Everywhere."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat up, knowing I was not good at this, but I still had to let him
          know, one way or another, why I was mad. "Listen, I appreciate that
          you killed that guy. He would have killed me if you hadn't done it.
          But the boy—he was still young, and I know your logic is to kill them
          so they wouldn't have to go through grief, but...you're not only
          stopping them from grieving...you're stopping them from a future they
          could have had. A life. Maybe even better than the one we have."
        </p>
        <p>
          When he didn't reply, I continued. "I know this business comes with a
          lot of blood on your hands, but sometimes, it's better to have a limit
          so you don't completely lose yourself. Draw the limit at hurting
          childing, or hell—any innocent person. You can kill a father, but you
          don't have to kill the child. Grief is normal. It hurts, but it's
          normal. You can't stop people from feeling it by killing them. You're
          only causing more damage to yourself."
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you," he said, shocking me for a second.</p>
        <p>"Are you just saying that so I'd stop talking?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "I understand where you're coming from. You've
          opened my eyes to many things today."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked blankly at him before frowning. "Right, glad you...yeah.
          Good talk."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, looking out the window, locking up his form in a way that
          told me he didn't want to talk anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, grabbed the ID card from the table, and continued with my
          food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, I'd push with more conversation, but I knew when to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ride was quieter on our way back, and I felt pretty
          uncomfortable...he had barely said a word to me after everything I
          said about the kid. He was locked in his mind, and I wondered what was
          going through that head.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until after he pulled up at a shady motel that I leaned away
          from the window, looking over at him. "Why are you stopping here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He unbuckled his seat belt, and I watched him grab the gun from the
          console, opening the bullet casing as he said. "You're going to drive
          back to the compound alone."
        </p>
        <p>I stifled a yawn. "What are you talking about?"</p>
        <p>
          He removed all the bullets, leaving just two inside it before he
          locked it close again. "You'll drive back to the compound alone," he
          repeated. "There's something I have to do." He said, finally meeting
          my confused gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, looking out the window at the worn-out building, before
          turning to him again. "What do you have to do here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nothing you should concern yourself with." He said, expression
          utterly void of all emotions. "I know you have no reason to help me do
          this, but; When you get to the compound, please find Casmiro, tell him
          to go to my bedroom and check the floorboards in my wardrobe. I left
          something in there for him and Angelo." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caution and confusion fought for dominance in my head, all the
          sleepiness slipping from my eyes, my senses at alert. "What the fuck
          are you talking about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He opened his side door, about to leave me there, but paused, "I can't
          believe you're the one I'm asking to do this...but—tell my brother I'm
          sorry and that I tried."
        </p>
        <p>"You tried what—"</p>
        <p>
          He was already getting out of the car, closing the door behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat alone in the humming vehicle for a few seconds, watching him
          walk around it towards the motel, wondering what the hell just
          happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two bullets...obviously he's going to kill someone...He wants me to
          deliver a message to Casmiro and tell Devil he's sorry?
        </p>
        <p>
          Two bullets...one for the person he wants to kill... whoever that is,
          and the other for...
        </p>
        <p>
          Realization dawned like ice water down my spine, and I was dashing
          right out of the car after him. <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>"HEY, MOTHERFUCKER!" </b></p>
        <p>
          My voice rang out into the night as I rushed after him. He stopped,
          shoulders slumping, head dropping as he turned towards me with a
          glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out short sharp breaths of tiredness, stopping right in front of
          his imposing figure, straightening my own form with determination even
          though my limbs begged for the relief that came with lying on a bed
          and stretching my muscles until I fell asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you have a message to pass across to your underboss and brother,
          you do that shit yourself." I led with that, my eyes taking him in.
        </p>
        <p>"It's just a simple task—"</p>
        <p>
          "Do I look like a suicide note?" I was livid. Angry! I wanted to bash
          his head in, anything to ease the fucking guilt lingering at the pit
          of my stomach. "We're gonna get our asses back in that car, and you're
          gonna drive us to the compound and deliver your fucking message
          yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          He actually looked like he was considering it before shaking his head.
          "That will be inconvenient."
        </p>
        <p>
          I threw my hands up and dropped them back in frustration. "Are you
          fucking kidding me?"
        </p>
        <p>"Drive back to the compound, and do as you're told,"</p>
        <p>
          "Like hell, I will?" I said, baffled at what was fucking happening.
          "You're crazy if you think I'll leave you here after your little
          speech in the car."
        </p>
        <p>
          With his hand that held the gun, he moved to rub his brows, closing
          his eyes for a second as he shook his head before opening his eyes and
          pinning me with a glare that had me stepping back a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Allow me to get this straight," he said. "You told me, just a few
          hours ago, to hurry up and do what I need to do, and now that I'm
          trying to do it, you want to stop me—"
        </p>
        <p>"But I already apolo—"</p>
        <p>"Shut up."</p>
        <p>"I'm not going to leave—"</p>
        <p>"Shut up."</p>
        <p>
          "This is fucking insane, Elio! You can't expect me just to let you—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shut up," He took a step closer to me. "Shut up." Another until he
          was standing right in front of me. "Shut the fuck up, Zahra!" he
          yelled in my face, and I inched back; his breathing was harsh, and so
          was mine. "Stop messing with my head. I'm fucking impressionable;
          words aren't just words for me. They're affirmations. You apologized,
          thank you for your apology, but it means absolutely fucking nothing to
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gulped down, guilt settling within me. I could tell he was so
          frustrated and on the brink of losing his shit because of how much he
          was cursing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No matter what you say," he continued. "Or how much you apologize; I
          will never forget every word you said by that roadside. It'll always
          be in my head. I'll always hear you repeat it over and over again.
          When I see you, that's all I'll think about; when I hear you speak,
          it's all I'll hear because that's how my brain works."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But I didn't mean it. I was just angry because it has been a long
          fucking day," I sighed. "No matter how much we don't like each other,
          I would have never said that to you if I had known you would take it
          seriously."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, this is the situation I find myself in. Don't feel guilty. This
          was my plan all along; I'm only making it quicker."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head. "No,"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "No." I countered with a confused frown, stepping away from him.
          "That's not how tonight's gonna go."
        </p>
        <p>"Go back to the car, Zahra."</p>
        <p>I outstretched my hand. "Give me the gun."</p>
        <p>
          His gaze slipped to my hand and back to my face with a stern glare.
          "Go back. To the car. Zahra." He repeated, a warning in his voice, one
          filled with so much venom, so much hate and frustration, but I
          couldn't leave him like this.
        </p>
        <p>"Give me the fucking gun," I said, standing straighter.</p>
        <p>He shook his head slowly. "Don't push me, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          "Just give me the gun, and then we can talk. No matter how much you
          fucked up with that kid, you didn't deserve what I said."
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a second. Just one second for his whole demeanor to change.
          The anger slipped from his eyes, his breathing calmed, and his grey
          eyes, completely vacant, were watching me in silence. It was like a
          switch had been turned off inside him, and I grew even more wary.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio?"</p>
        <p>"I love it." He said, deep voice flat and unfeeling.</p>
        <p>I frowned. "What...what are you talking about now?"</p>
        <p>
          "The fear my presence compels on people." He examines the gun in his
          hand. "The smell of blood, and death, and suffering, and tears,
          ah...fuck," he closed his eyes as if he could see and smell all he
          just listed. "It's like heaven. Chaos, massacres." He opened his eyes.
          "I crave it like oxygen. I fucking love it, Zahra, killing that kid,
          it felt so fucking good,"
        </p>
        <p>I locked my jaw. "You're lying."</p>
        <p>
          He scanned my form from head to toe, slowly, tentatively, until his
          intense vacant gaze locked with mine. Then he moved, closing the space
          between us enough for me to crane my neck, looking up at him, my
          breathing unsteady and shaky.
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised the gun, trailing the barrel's mouth from my forehead, past
          my brows, down my cheek, and to the surface of my bottom lip, where he
          stopped, raised his gaze, and then...smiled.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart hammered. It wasn't a smile of amusement or happiness, no. It
          was a smile soaked with retribution, malice, and trickery...but
          somehow, it still managed to be beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          "One thing you should never do, Zahra, is to make a hero out of me. I
          have killed men, women, children...people I care for. I have lost
          count of people who scream my name before I end their lives, I have
          taken and taken and taken more than I should, and I don't regret any
          of it. The most beautiful thing is that the business is just a
          cover-up for how fucked up my head is, for how much I love what I do."
          He pressed his forehead to mine, closing his eyes as he swallowed and
          said, "How much I <i>long</i> for it."
        </p>
        <p>My throat worked. "You're just saying that."</p>
        <p>
          A breathy laugh left him. "You don't believe it? I'm not surprised.
          People love to underestimate me and make assumptions based on my
          actions. He's kind sometimes; He's calm. He doesn't care; all he wants
          is power; he's all talk and no actions. Do you want to know why that
          is? It's because the people who are supposed to confirm the action are
          either six feet under or fish food. The stories you hear about The
          Wicked are just a scratch in the surface of what I'm capable of."
        </p>
        <p>
          He drew back from me, still in my face, as he opened his eyes to look
          at me, smile draining away. "If you don't want to know, first hand,
          what I'm truly capable of, how I could ruin you and serve you your
          worse fear in a silver fucking platter, you'll walk back to that car
          and drive away from me."
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed, grinding my teeth together as I said. "No."</p>
        <p>His jaw locked. "Don't make me kill you, Zahra."</p>
        <p>"You've tried a number of times before; it didn't work."</p>
        <p>"Don't make me do it."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not leaving here without you," I told him. "Everything you just
          said might be true, but I've seen you hold off from shooting and
          killing people just because you didn't want to hurt the ones related
          to them. Maybe you're not so far gone."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "Oh no, Zahra, don't be mistaken. I really just
          wasn't in the mood to kill anyone. I hold off because when I don't,
          there's no stopping me; I love it too much to stop. That explosion,
          the chaos we caused, the people who might have died. It drove me to
          the edge; I was gripping that gun so tight because of how much I loved
          it and wanted to make sure no one survived it. Make sure I finish the
          job. If I'm being honest, I don't want to like it, I don't want to do
          it, because when I do, it's the best feeling in this world...that's
          how sick I am, Zahra. And that's why you're right. This world would be
          a much better place without me in it."
        </p>
        <p>"Alright, but give me the gun."</p>
        <p>
          "If I don't go in there and kill my father, Everything you told me in
          that restaurant will mean nothing to me. If I leave here, back to the
          compound, alive, I will be worse than I am now. Is that what you
          want?"
        </p>
        <p>I paused, watching him with confusion. "Your...father?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, my father."</p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him. There was no sign of a joke in his eyes. He was
          completely serious right now. "Your father's dead, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>He remained quiet.</p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my cheek, changing my approach and asking him
          directly without making assumptions from what I'd heard. "Is your
          father dead?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          I took in a shaky breath, taking a step back. "You faked his death?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"He's been here all this time?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>I shook my head, genuinely confused. "Wh—why?"</p>
        <p>"Because I want to kill him."</p>
        <p>
          I watched him for a long time, my eyes flickering between his as I
          said quietly. "I think you need help, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm well aware."</p>
        <p>"So why don't you get help?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't wish to; I'm undeserving of it. Stop making me talk, and just
          go."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nothing you say will make me leave here without you. I don't care if
          you're a sick psychopath who doesn't wanna get help; I am not leaving
          unless you get in the car with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Staring at me for a moment too long, He sighed, dropping his head like
          he was running thoughts through his mind, and then he looked back at
          me and outstretched the gun towards me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collected it from his grip, blowing out a breath of relief. "I know
          my words might mean nothing right now, but I really didn't mean what I
          said, and I'm sorry. I really am."
        </p>
        <p>
          Without responding, he walked past me towards the direction of the
          car.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned, watching him for a few seconds, before sighing, looking back
          at the motel, and following behind him.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          In about half an hour, we reached the compound, and Elio pulled over
          right in front of the quarters where my gang and I were situated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still uneasy, I bid him good night and got out of the car, his gun was
          still with me, and I knew it was useless because I was pretty sure he
          had more guns in his possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking around, soldiers were guarding the area here and there, and I
          walked towards the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of the car door opening and closing had me stopping and
          turning to see Elio approaching me. "I'm not giving you your gun
          back." I cleared up.
        </p>
        <p>"You can keep it, Sport." He said, standing before me.</p>
        <p>"Alright." I nodded, turning to leave, but he grabbed my wrist.</p>
        <p>"Wait."</p>
        <p>
          His hold on my wrist was warm, and the feeling somehow managed to
          creep up my skin in a way that had my heart pumping blood to my body
          with the main purpose of making me flush.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What," I stated in question, unable to stop my gaze from flickering
          to his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio mirrored my action but made no move. "You won't tell anyone about
          my father."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's nothing to tell...your father's dead. He's been dead for
          years; everyone knows that."
        </p>
        <p>
          He was about to say something when the door to the house pulled open,
          and Devil rushed out, beeling towards us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Devil—" Before I could complete my statement, Devil was yanking
          Elio's hold from my wrist, shoving him hard on the chest, and landing
          a blow to his face. Elio stumbled back at the impact. Soldiers rushed
          towards us, and Elio quickly waved them off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly intervened when Devil wanted to charge toward his brother
          again, getting between the two. "That's enough, D. Rein it in." his
          chest was heaving, a deadly glare aimed directly at Elio, who worked
          his jaw with his hand, making no move to attack back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was for letting her get kidnapped," Devil said, trying to inch
          closer to Elio, but I held him back. "Fucking touch her again, and see
          what I'll do," he finished, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with him
          towards the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned briefly, just in time to see Elio, shoving both hands into
          his pocket, his eyes on the both of us. Something flashed through
          them, but Devil pulled me inside the house before I could name it,
          slamming the door shut behind us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled my hand from his grip, stepping away from him with a glare.
          "That was so uncalled for. Why the fuck did you hit him?"
        </p>
        <p>"Are you seriously asking me that question?"</p>
        <p>"Yes! It's not his fault that I got kidnapped, Devil."</p>
        <p>
          He looked at me with disbelief, eyes running down my body as if just
          noticing my change of clothes. "But he wanted to leave you there. He
          would have returned without you if it weren't for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, but that's not important anymore because he still came for
          me; stop being such a controlling jerk; the look doesn't suit you."
        </p>
        <p>"Controlling?"</p>
        <p>
          A shuffle from a corner made us turn to find Upper watching us,
          leaning on the kitchen entryway. "Oh sweet, Devil," he taunted.
          "Always trying to control things he doesn't possess."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shut the fuck up and mind your own business; this has nothing to do
          with you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper scoffed, glancing briefly at me before looking at Devil. "Right,
          nothing to do with me at all."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned.</p>
        <p>
          "Glad you're not dead, Zahra," Upper said, and then he flipped Devil
          off before disappearing down the passage, a bedroom door slamming a
          few seconds after.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at the direction Upper had gone through before returning my
          attention to Devil, who had an unreadable expression on his face.
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck was that about?"</p>
        <p>"Nothing." He said.</p>
        <p>"I'm not an idiot, Devil. Upper's pissed; Upper is never pissed."</p>
        <p>"It's nothing." He snapped.</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "I'm just gonna go to bed; I'm too tired for this
          shit."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't follow me," I told him before heading to my bedroom, knowing
          Milk and Dog would be fast asleep already, we were dead into the
          morning, and I should probably question why Upper and Devil were still
          up together. I knew Devil would wait up, but like Dog, Upper liked his
          sleep, so it was weird.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment I fell on the bed, I groaned in tiredness, my grip still on
          Elio's gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shoved it under the pillow with a tired sigh and passed out after a
          few seconds.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "Make one for me?" I said to Upper as I yawned and stretched, entering
          the kitchen, with him making coffee. He nodded at my request without
          looking at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Morning Zahra!" Milk yelled from the living room. "I stopped by your
          room early, and you were dead asleep, mouth open and all."
        </p>
        <p>"Creep," I muttered.</p>
        <p>She chuckled.</p>
        <p>
          Now in a simple tank top and shorts, I sat atop one of the kitchen
          stools, placing my hand on my cheek as I watched Upper work on the
          coffee machine, rubbing sleep from his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second to Dog, Upper was the one I warmed up to after meeting. He was
          always smiling, observant, and loved talking about things he claimed
          to know nothing about. Upper wasn't a mystery; he was an open book, an
          open book that held so many hidden secrets I would have loved to
          unearth if I didn't have many of my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'd asked him about his accent years ago, he'd told me it was
          learned, but I wasn't stupid. If the others believed that shit, I
          didn't. He was too accurate, too fluent, and effortless for it to be
          learned from movies and tv shows. Coupling it all down with his posh
          mannerisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would often act a certain proper way, catch himself doing it, and
          adjust to being brash.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never spoke on it or pointed it out; if the others caught it too,
          they said nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We stayed away from broaching the 'extra personal' in our lives. We
          kept our past to our past and functioned well with our presence. There
          was a possibility we would perform better if we knew where we each
          came from, but none of us were willing or eager to let that
          information slip.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the code names we shared were through the information they
          provided when we all met. It could be lies, could be true, no one
          knows. But we still trusted each other, and it was healthy.
        </p>
        <p>I worked my shoulders, trying to free my coiled muscles.</p>
        <p>
          "I have a feeling you're being hostile with me," I said, watching his
          back tense up, but he continued what he was doing. "You know you can
          talk to me about anything if I did something wrong or said something
          that upset you."
        </p>
        <p>
          He let out a shaky breath, turning with a fresh cup of coffee for me.
          I collected it, watching him avoid eye contact.
        </p>
        <p>"Upper—"</p>
        <p>
          "It's not you," he said, bright hazel eyes raising to look at me. "You
          didn't do anything."
        </p>
        <p>"So why are you being weird?"</p>
        <p>"I—"</p>
        <p>
          "Baby Zahra." arms hugged me from behind as Dog slammed a kiss to my
          cheek. "I missed you!"
        </p>
        <p>Oh shit.</p>
        <p>I tried to push him off. "Get off me, you clingy beast."</p>
        <p>
          He tightened his hold and whispered harshly in my ear. "Where are my
          fucking pills."
        </p>
        <p>"Hidden." I gritted.</p>
        <p>
          "I can take that. My fucking pot is what I can't take; I was going
          crazy last night, you motherfucker." He gritted with a strained smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I told you, you're not getting high without me to monitor you,
          motherfucker." I gritted with a strained smile too, and Upper eyed us
          warily.
        </p>
        <p>I tried to squirm myself free.</p>
        <p>
          "You could have at least left a joint, bitch." His grip tightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was choking for air as I gritted. "Again, not getting high without
          me. You wanna get stoned; we get stoned together; that's how this
          relationship works, cunt."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This relationship works how I say it works; a joint wouldn't make me
          an addict, you fucking snake."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your action right now is fucking proof you're on the brink, you
          fucking dog; maybe I should throw the fucking pills away."
        </p>
        <p>"Do that and die a very miserable death in the Karakoram."</p>
        <p>"That's oddly specific."</p>
        <p>"I can make it happen—"</p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck are you guys muttering about? You're scaring me." Upper
          said mug paused halfway to his lips, eyes wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog released me, slapping my shoulder twice—in a not-so-friendly way.
          "Just catching up." He said, walking around the kitchen, all through
          with his eyes on me. When he reached behind Upper, his glare rained,
          and he slashed a thumb to his throat, a premature gesture of him doing
          the same to me with a knife.
        </p>
        <p>I rolled my eyes, drinking Upper's fantastic coffee.</p>
        <p>
          When Devil walked in shortly after, Upper took his leave, joining Milk
          in the living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something was going on between those two. But Devil isn't into
          men...or is he?
        </p>
        <p>
          All day, my head was filtering through thoughts, and even as they
          debriefed me on the painting with information that could be useful and
          resources we might need, my full attention wasn't on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three things swarmed through my head. Upper and Devil, what could
          possibly be going on? Is it what I feared? Why do I fear it?
        </p>
        <p>
          The painting, what could be so important aside from the gold? Why in
          hell is Martino searching for it? And why didn't he ever mention
          Arturo Garza to me? If he kept that a secret, what other secrets did
          he keep from me? How was he even capable of keeping secrets from me?
          What does it mean?
        </p>
        <p>And finally...Elio.</p>
        <p>
          What really happened to make him that way? A heartless man with a
          heart, unpredictable to a fucking fault. How many cobwebs were in his
          wardrobe? His father was alive? This means Elio isn't the only family
          Devil has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo had stopped by earlier to get a little debriefing about what
          the Koreans had asked me, I had kept Martino's name out of it, but the
          man could tell I was hiding something else. Before he left, I
          hesitated but asked him about Elio because, if I was honest with
          myself, I was a little worried about him and how we had left things
          last night.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was probably the guilt eating me up at his revelation of how deep
          my words had cut him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo had looked at me weirdly, and I wouldn't blame him; it was
          weird. I shouldn't care.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was relieved when he said Elio was doing okay but had left the
          compound with Casmiro quite early for business. Then he asked why I
          was asking, and I just shrugged, not giving him an answer, which I was
          sure made my behavior even more suspicious.
        </p>
        <p>
          He dropped it, though, and I was glad he did. Hopefully, he doesn't
          tell Elio I asked. That would be embarrassing.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a small game of cards with the group, I retired early, still not
          well-rested from the last few days' events. I wore one of Milk's short
          satin nightgowns, one of the many that had somehow stumbled into my
          wardrobe. I could swear the girl was slowly changing my choice of
          clothing because each time something new was mysteriously added, one
          of my comfort clothes she had disapproved of would go missing.
        </p>
        <p>I settled in bed, tossing and turning in discomfort.</p>
        <p>
          Sleep always seemed to come easy to me, but I was struggling tonight,
          and I honestly could not pick a reason why.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slipping my hand underneath my pillow, I brought Elio's gun to my
          view, examining it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers brushed through the mouth of the gun, the same one that had
          touched my lips the other night. An action that should have made me
          wary of the impending death that could strike me if a shot was fired,
          made me bristle with desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hate that I'm attracted to him, hate that his body had a huge part
          to play in it, but his mind and manners managed to hold a firm part of
          this attraction too.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers brushed the hilt, and I stopped when I found his initials
          at the bottom of the gun. <b>E.M</b>.
        </p>
        <p>I chuckled. "Obnoxious fucker."</p>
        <p>
          I slipped the gun back underneath my pillow and turned to my side,
          closing my eyes and trying to force the sleep.
        </p>
        <p>It didn't come.</p>
        <p>I groaned, sitting upright. I could use a pill.</p>
        <p>I got out of bed and out of the room.</p>
        <p>
          Milk and Dog were still awake, seeing as I could hear their bickering
          from the living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went down a small corridor opposite Devil and Upper's room, stopping
          before the fire extinguisher. I opened the sitting where it was
          mounted, reaching behind it quietly and grabbing a stash of pills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"What the bloody hell, Devil. How does that even sound to you?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused at the sound of Upper's agitated voice. Quietly, I closed the
          glass to the extinguisher and walked towards their bedroom door,
          leaning to press my ear against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"It sounds perfect, Upper. I like her, and we've been doing this
            for almost a year now, and I want it all with her; I know she does
            too." </i
          >He sounded uncertain like he was trying to convince himself that he
          liked me and that I liked him too.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Okay, fine, I'm not against it, nor will I ask you not to ask her.
            But I care about Zahra too, and I won't let you half-ass it with
            her. You must tell her about us. She deserves to know your
            reservations before you string her along."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>My stomach sank.</p>
        <p><i>Us. </i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"For God's sake, Upper, there's no us. There never was. I'm fucking
            straight."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper scoffed.
          <i
            >"I'm not about to help you define your sexuality, but I can assure
            you that a straight guy wouldn't exactly give a gay guy a bloody
            hand job or receive a bloody blow job from a gay guy and then kiss
            him afterward, just saying."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>What the fuck?</p>
        <p>
          <i>"It just happened, Upper. It didn't mean shit to me. </i>You<i>
            don't mean shit to me; Zahra does. And you—don't give me that
            fucking look; you came on to me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I heard a gasp from Upper. <i>"I came unto you?" </i>his voice
          shook.
          <i
            >"That's the worst fucking thing you could ever say to me. Listen,
            it was mutual; you had every right to forfeit the dare and not give
            me a hand job; if anything, you started it. But you don't see me
            saying that or accusing you of coming on to me."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Devil sighed. <i>"Upper, I didn't mean it like that—" </i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"No, you're confused and so fucking toxic and problematic, and you
            rub it off on everyone who dares to even come close to you. I didn't
            ask for this shit. I didn't ask you to tell me shit you've never
            told anyone and make me feel like we were something special when it
            obviously meant shit to you, just like you said."</i
          >
          He sounded so hurt, and I wasn't sure if my heart was aching from the
          not-so-betrayal or for Upper.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Upper—"</i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"And now you're about to use Zahra to what? Fuel your denial? She
            doesn't deserve that shit."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"That's not what I'm trying to do. I genuinely care about Zahra; I
            think I'm falling in love with her—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"You think. You're not sure. You're leading her on, on a maybe...."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Deciding I'd heard enough, I twisted the knob and pushed open the
          door, startling both of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The look on my face probably spelled the fact that I'd overheard part
          of their conversation due to the horror on Upper's face and the curse
          Devil muttered.
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't help but feel a sting at the sight of him.</p>
        <p>
          Somewhere along the line, something had blurred. I had gotten too
          comfortable with him, and I would have shocked myself by saying yes to
          making things official because it was Devil. He was my best friend and
          the first guy I'd been with more than once after leaving Martino in
          Sicily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil and I downplayed what we had almost every time, trying to stay
          within our limits, but there was something there, which was why I felt
          a little hurt and betrayed by this new reveal.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So that's why you both have been acting weird around each other?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper plopped down on the bed, resting his elbow on his knees as he
          covered his face with his palms, almost as if he couldn't believe this
          was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is anyone gonna answer me?" my voice went a pitch louder, and Upper
          flinched.
        </p>
        <p>Devil sighed. "It's not what you think, Z."</p>
        <p>
          "Don't even fucking try to twist this, Devil; everything I heard is
          exactly what I think. It's exactly what this thing is?" I gestured
          between them.
        </p>
        <p>Devil walked, trying to reach out to me. "Zahra, please..."</p>
        <p>I took a step back. "Don't fucking touch me."</p>
        <p>
          From my periphery, I spotted Dog and Milk right outside the room,
          watching the scene cautiously because this was the first time any
          meaningful argument would occur between us.
        </p>
        <p>And this was meaningful, all right.</p>
        <p>
          "At least let me explain what this is." He said, fear lingering in his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's there to explain? Look at him! Look at me; look at yourself.
          Look at the fucking situation we're all in. It's all self-explanatory;
          there's nothing you can say that would make more sense than this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay, fine, you're right, but that doesn't change anything... it
          doesn't change how I feel about you, or—I—fuck." He was so confused. I
          could hear it in his voice, see it in his eyes, the way they flickered
          between me and a distraught, probably traumatized Upper, almost as if
          he couldn't tell whom to comfort or make feel better. "I don't even
          know anymore," he muttered, his voice hurt and defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a friend, I wanted to hug him, make him explain his feelings, but
          as a—as a what? We were nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, blinking. "I know we didn't put a label and shit, but
          I thought this—I thought we—" I sighed. "This is so messed up, Devil."
        </p>
        <p>He dropped his head. "I know...I'm sorry."</p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted to Upper, who had both hands gripping his hair, not
          once looking up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm out of here," I muttered, turning on my heel and walking out of
          the room. I brushed past Dog and Milk, who threw me a sympathetic look
          that I ignored.
        </p>
        <p>Did they know about it too?</p>
        <p>I couldn't even think about that now.</p>
        <p>I was almost out of the house when Dog caught up to me. "Hey."</p>
        <p>"Not now, Dog."</p>
        <p>"I wanted to give you a coat."</p>
        <p>
          I turned to him, forcing on a smile as I collected the coat and
          slipped it on, pocketing the stash of pills before he could catch a
          glimpse of them.
        </p>
        <p>"You good?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Not really."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded as if he understood. "Are you gonna go out there and cry?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed. "The day I cry over a boy is the day I stab myself in both
          eyes. I just need a breather."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kay, use the kitchen window; there are a few soldiers standing guard
          outside tonight; it would be difficult to slip out."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hugged him with a light squeeze. "Behind the fire extinguisher, I
          hid two joints."
        </p>
        <p>"How do you know that's why I'm helping you?"</p>
        <p>
          I laughed, pulling away before flipping him off and making my way out
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somehow, after maneuvering the guards outside the compound, I found
          myself climbing the killer stairs to the rooftop. The anxiety of
          falling was still present, and when I finally reached up and passed
          through the door, I breathed a sigh of relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, motherfucker. What kind of a psychopath is this fucking man?" I
          winced a whisper to myself, the cold wind from up high easing my
          muscles as I walked towards the railing, sucking in a deep breath with
          my hair whipping around my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quietness calmed me, and I replayed the whole event in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would most definitely be awkward between us all now. But did I even
          have the right to feel like I was cheated on? We weren't even in a
          relationship, so...but I thought we were exclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew Devil was confused. Despite his denial, I knew he felt
          something for Upper, but he was scared to lean into it; I knew he felt
          something for me too, but what he had with Upper was stronger. I knew
          it; I saw it. And I was partly mad that he treated Upper that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of us deserved this situation we were in, but hell, if the god of
          situations cared what we do or do not deserve at this—
        </p>
        <p>"If you're,"</p>
        <p>
          "Motherfucker!" My hands flew to my chest, turning to find the owner
          of the voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "...looking to jump, I suggest the left side of the railing. It's
          steeper. One hit, you'll crack your skull on the cobblestones, death
          on impact. I've experimented and found that it's more efficient."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was running ten times per second, having almost jumped out of
          my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was sitting on the ground, his back against the carved stoned
          roof chair, with a bottle of cheap beer in his grip. He had his
          attention on me as he asked.
        </p>
        <p>"So, are you jumping, or would you like a push?" <br /></p>

          <b>"YOU KNOW </b>what? I'll take the push. I would have jumped on my
          own, but I'm too scared," I responded when my heart returned to its
          normal position and started doing its job properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio paused as if trying to see if I was being serious, and when I
          didn't counter my statement, he breathed out in relief. "Oh, finally."
          he attempted to stand, but I quickly responded.
        </p>
        <p>"That was a joke! Jesus."</p>
        <p>
          The man groaned in annoyance before he sat back down, looking away
          from my figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why are you so eager to kill me?" I chuckled at how his gloomy aura
          had shined in excitement at the prospect of him getting to push me
          over the railing.

          "It is one of my many fantasies." He surprised me with his response,
          and I couldn't help the thoughts spinning inside my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ouuu, fantasies." I pressed my back to the brick railing, my front
          facing him.
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't sexually connote that."</p>
        <p>
          "Sorry, Dad, my mind already drove me down that route, and now I'm
          curious to know more about these fantasies you seem to be having."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, not responding as he brought the beer bottle to his
          lips while he took a swig at it, his throat working as he swallowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I went out of that house to be alone, but somehow, I was
          comfortable in his presence. I knew if anyone were to leave, it should
          be me, seeing as this rooftop seemed to be 'his' place.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't look like a beer kinda guy," I voiced into the silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I also don't look like the suicide <i>kinda</i> guy, but here we
          are." He said so casually while I flinched at the word, shifting
          uncomfortably.
        </p>
        <p>"You're so nonchalant about it."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"Can you shut up?"</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't appreciate the screech in your voice. It doesn't complement
          my migraine. So I'd appreciate your silence."
        </p>
        <p>
          I threw my head back and laughed, my chest vibrating from how amused I
          was by his response. Looking back at him, I caught his eyes on me,
          intense and a little guarded as his gaze swept up and down my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heat from his stare made me shift on my feet, and my laugh
          simmered down while I made sure to ignore the faint flutter that came
          with his attention.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't you have normal clothing?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "No," I curved my lips. "It's all silk and satin in my wardrobe." I
          lied. "I think it's sexy."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course." His gaze lingered on my exposed thighs for a second too
          long before he looked away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chuckled, stopping the sound by hooking my teeth on my bottom lip
          and leaning away from the railing as I walked towards the bricked
          chair, eyeing the space beside him and debating for a few beats on if
          I should sit on the chair or settle beside him on the ground. The
          ground seemed a better option, and I settled down next to him, leaving
          just a few inches between our bodies, but I was still close enough to
          feel how his form grew tense with me sitting close.
        </p>
        <p>
          I waited for him to complain, but he didn't, so I relaxed further and
          broke the comfortable silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is actually a nightgown, by the way. The other one was just a
          normal dress."
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't ask."</p>
        <p>
          I rested my back against the brick chair, looking up at the dark sky
          filled with stars. The moon was bright and welcoming, and I couldn't
          fight the urge to soak it all in as I closed my eyes and took a lung
          full of air before releasing it in a calm breath and opening my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt Elio's stare, so I turned my head to catch his gaze on me,
          unwavering. He did not attempt to pretend he hadn't been staring at
          me, and I did not attempt to look away either.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grey of his eyes was darker yet softer, like he was in his most
          relaxed state and had no thought on his mind. The haunted glint I
          found in them the night before was missing, and I secretly wondered if
          it was the beer that made him seem so approachable right now. It was
          similar to the look he'd worn when talking to that girl at the
          restaurant, but I could still see that his guard was up, ready for
          anything I might want to throw at him.
        </p>
        <p>Damn. His eyes...they showed a lot when he allowed it.</p>
        <p>
          I hate that I liked it so much. That the lure of his gaze could suck
          you in without even intending to do so, and that's where I'm at,
          sucked in.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't look away.</p>
        <p>I couldn't look away.</p>
        <p>I hated that my heart rate had spiked again.</p>
        <p>
          I hated that the silence was a comfortable one. I hate this. Whatever
          this is.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze roamed from my eyes to my cheeks, over to my nose, then to my
          lips.
        </p>
        <p>"You have an impressive face." He spoke.</p>
        <p>I frowned in confusion. "Um, what—"</p>
        <p>"I like your hair."</p>
        <p>I blinked at him, unsure what to say to the weird—compliment.</p>
        <p>"Is that a compliment?"</p>
        <p>He looked away. "An observation."</p>
        <p>"Oh..." I shifted. "Thanks for the observation?"</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, taking another swig of the beer, the remaining contents
          inside the bottle, a drink away from being empty.
        </p>
        <p>"Why are you here?" I asked him, wondering if he would—</p>
        <p>"Couldn't sleep." He answered.</p>
        <p>
          Devil's voice filtered through my head from the time he told me Elio
          looked like someone who never slept. I was curious to know more about
          it...about him.
        </p>
        <p>"And you don't have sleeping pills to aid?"</p>
        <p>"I do."</p>
        <p>"Why don't you just take them?"</p>
        <p>
          He was silent for a second, and I watched his brows draw down in a
          debating frown like he was unsure if he should continue talking or
          ignore me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't be surprised if he ignored me. We weren't exactly friends.
          I mean—I've seen him in a terrible state, and I've talked him out of
          his head once, and I don't think that side of him is something he
          showed to people. And I didn't want it to seem like I was prying
          because I cared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I have a hero complex. I like helping people and making sure
          everyone is okay around me, and I shouldn't care about Elio because he
          tried to drown me, but—when you survive a shoot-out with someone, you
          tend to form a survivor's bond with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess that's what this is...and yeah, the unwanted physical
          attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can't be near those pills. I'm not in the proper state of mind," he
          answered after the prolonged silence.
        </p>
        <p>"How many people know that you—that you're like this?"</p>
        <p>"Suicidal? It's a word; you can say it."</p>
        <p>"Yeah, I might be tough as shit, but I'm not insensitive."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He hummed, "No one asides Angelo...and now you. If you're
          thinking of spreading the word, don't bother. No one would believe
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not." I injected immediately. "Why doesn't Casmiro know? You both
          are close, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I already have Angelo to worry about; therefore, I don't need Cas on
          my throat too."
        </p>
        <p>"But I know..."</p>
        <p>
          "I don't have to worry about you since you hate me and want me to do
          it faster."
        </p>
        <p>My stomach dipped. "I d—"</p>
        <p>
          "Why are <i>you</i> here?" he cut me off. "You shouldn't be here; you
          shouldn't even be out of the house."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away from him. "I couldn't sleep too. I—" I cleared my
          throat. "Needed a break from...everyone."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>I glanced at him. "You're not gonna ask why?"</p>
        <p>"I don't care enough to."</p>
        <p>Right. So it's just me, then.</p>
        <p>
          The silence stretched between us again, and I broke it with a prying
          question because, yes, I can't help myself; sue me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So your sleeping problems, is it—where's it from? Did something
          happen to you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, he turned his head and met my gaze with confusion. "There
          isn't some grand story behind it if that's what you're thinking," he
          said. "Christ, you sound like a book character, one of those prying,
          annoying ones. I have clinical depression, and sleeping disorder is
          one of the hiccups that come with it."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh..."</p>
        <p>
          "I either sleep too much or don't sleep at all. Often, I find myself
          not sleeping at all unless I take something and force it," he said.
          "Tonight is one of those nights when I don't want to force it. Does
          that answer your question?"
        </p>
        <p>"Not really..."</p>
        <p>"Should I interpret it in Spanish?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "No, I—" I sighed. "That's not what I meant. I'm just confused because
          you know what's wrong with you, yet you won't fix it. It doesn't make
          any sense to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's good that it doesn't. Because I'm not going to explain. I
          already told you the other day that I am underserving of it—"
        </p>
        <p>"Says who?" I cut in.</p>
        <p>
          "Says me," he answered. "Now quit prying and being unnecessarily
          annoying."
        </p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes, fishing for the stash of white pills in my pocket.
          "If you're trying to wear yourself out, the cheap beer won't do the
          trick," I said, dangling the stash in the space between us.
        </p>
        <p>He eyed it and then me. "What are you insinuating?"</p>
        <p>"You wanna get high?" I asked with a grin.</p>
        <p>
          After a bit of silence, he spoke. "Does my brother do drugs, too?"
          There was an edge to his voice that had me shaking my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nope, he doesn't even know. It's just Dog and me; we don't do it
          often, but sometimes, we get high and smoke joints because life is
          shit, and you just gotta escape it for a few hours."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not healthy, Sport."</p>
        <p>"I'm not a kid, Dad."</p>
        <p>"You could get addicted."</p>
        <p>"I know my limits."</p>
        <p>"It's—"</p>
        <p>"Do you wanna get high? Or not?"</p>
        <p>
          He eyed the pills and then me. I watched him struggle with a decision
          for a few beats before he outstretched his palm toward me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned, slipping out a pill as I said. "I knew there was a crazy in
          there somewhere." I placed one in his palm, and he eyed it.
        </p>
        <p>"How strong is it?"</p>
        <p>
          "One won't tip you off the edge, but it's enough to weaken your limbs
          and make you feel lighter...also, maybe a little...." I watched him
          put it in his mouth and swallow before I completed my statement.
          "...horny."
        </p>
        <p>He didn't freak out like I expected.</p>
        <p>
          I popped one in my mouth and swallowed, keeping the rest in the jacket
          pocket. "It's the kind that dissolves into your bloodstream
          immediately after taking it, so it takes about a few seconds to kick
          in. It's really good stuff."
        </p>
        <p>"I hope I don't like it too much."</p>
        <p>I scoffed. "It's just one pill."</p>
        <p>"I know. I have APD." He said casually.</p>
        <p>I paused. That didn't sound good. "What does...APD mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "Addictive personality disorder. It's not intense, but it's there. I
          get attached to things easily...people too. And when I don't control
          it, it turns into an addiction. Like books, killing people, cleaning,
          and...what else? Ah...yes, cigars."
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared at him, my eyes growing wide in apprehension. "What the fuck,
          Elio? Why didn't you say anything?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me with a raised brow. "I said I hope I don't like it too
          much."
        </p>
        <p>"How the fuck is that supposed to tell me <i>anything</i>?"</p>
        <p>
          He shrugged like he didn't care as he downed the remaining content in
          the beer bottle while I sat there, feeling the effect of the drugs and
          feeling like shit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's like you've made it your personal mission to fill me with guilt
          at every turn," I said, annoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I refuse to take responsibility for what you feel; it's—oh," he
          paused. "I feel it."
        </p>
        <p>
          My limbs grew weaker, and I felt lighter, but I wasn't feeling the
          feeling, not after what he had just told me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's...outstanding...wow...what's the name? where'd you get it?" His
          voice came out raspy as he dropped the empty beer bottle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm never telling you that...God, it's fucked up; I feel like shit."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't." he released a breath, dropping his head on the brick chair
          with an open-mouthed sigh before he looked up at the sky. "I feel so
          light. The stars are dancing; it's beautiful."
        </p>
        <p>
          I groaned, allowing the pill to take effect by wiping off my
          annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The moon is so large; I think it's smiling. Can you see it?" he
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up just in time to see the moon grow large, a soft smile
          curving at the bottom. It also had eyes that looked down at us with a
          calmness that made me sigh.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, I see it."</p>
        <p>And then...it was silent.</p>
        <p>
          A comfortable one that I didn't feel like breaking and I don't know
          how long we sat there for, but it felt like minutes. Long minutes.
        </p>
        <p>I felt the air grow colder, signaling midnight.</p>
        <p>"I finally figured it out." Elio voiced after a while.</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>"Why I talk a lot when I'm around you."</p>
        <p>
          I turned my body to the left so that I was facing him, and my side
          rested on the chair. My movement, though, felt sluggish. "Yeah? Why's
          that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're alike." He spoke. "In many ways. And I'm talkative. I like
          talking."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I figured that one out," I said with a chuckle, and I realized we
          were closer than before; I could smell him now. He had this distinct
          smell of sweet vanilla spice rum, I guess from his cigars, and then
          there was a whiff of expensive perfume with a hint of orange blossom,
          and...there's something else... was it lilies? God, he just smelt
          terrific, or maybe it's the pill.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You like talking too." He said. "You talk a lot, and it makes me want
          to respond. I shouldn't respond because I'm supposed to be a man of
          few words."
        </p>
        <p>"You are very good at pretending like you are."</p>
        <p>
          "I know. I've been doing it all my life. I like it sometimes...just
          being quiet."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too," I said, wondering what the point of this conversation was. I
          didn't really care.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I like talking to you," he confessed. "I like that you annoy me." his
          voice came with a hint of a slur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faint flutter attacked. "With my screechy voice, as you call it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. I want you dead too. Preferably when you're talking, I'd like to
          slit your throat and watch you choke on your blood." He spoke. "It's
          one of my fantasies, too."
        </p>
        <p>
          I laughed instead of being wary of his confession. It was funny, and
          the pill made it funnier.
        </p>
        <p>"You hate me that much?"</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          I watched him for a long time, for some reason, wishing he would look
          at me.
        </p>
        <p>"Why aren't you like—married? You're old enough to." I said.</p>
        <p>"So are you,"</p>
        <p>
          "I'm approaching my mid-twenties. I still have free time, but you're
          like...twenty-eight—twenty-nine? Or..."
        </p>
        <p>"Fishing for my age, Sport?"</p>
        <p>"Curious."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm thirty-three...in about five months, I'll be 34, approaching
          mid-thirties."
        </p>
        <p>I jerked up, watching him with wide eyes. "No way,"</p>
        <p>
          He turned to look at me. Oh, I know why I wanted him to look at me
          now, his eyes, God. "What do you mean?" He asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I caught myself. "You don't look thirty-three. Are you fucking kidding
          me?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't kid."</p>
        <p>I scoffed out a laugh. "Jesus, you look younger."</p>
        <p>"I don't know if you know this, but thirty-three isn't old."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I know, but—like, I'm just surprised. You're so handsome and
          young and hot."
        </p>
        <p>He looked away, his body shifting uncomfortably.</p>
        <p>"Okay, so, still prying...why don't you have a girlfriend?"</p>
        <p>
          He shrugged. "I don't know. I have no interest in trivial things like
          that."
        </p>
        <p>"Understandable." I said, "So...You've never had a girlfriend?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"How often do you have sex, then?"</p>
        <p>He sucked in a breath. "You have no filter."</p>
        <p>
          "I blame it on the drugs," I said, allowing my tone to grow sensual as
          I asked. "So...how often?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I ignored the heat from his body and how we'd drawn closer to each
          other. The lightness in my head turned heady, and I leaned into that
          heat.
        </p>
        <p>"Not often." His voice was hoarse.</p>
        <p>
          The pace at which my heart thumped had doubled, but I still pushed.
          "When was the last time?"
        </p>
        <p>He stopped to think. "A year and a half...maybe more."</p>
        <p>"Dude, that's—that's ballsy."</p>
        <p>"Intimacy is sacred for me," he said.</p>
        <p>
          "Is that so..." I said softly, raising my hand to trace my index
          finger down his forearm.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned his head to me again, gaze falling on my hand on his arm
          while his muscles grew tense under my touch.
        </p>
        <p>"So, like," I continued. "You like every woman you fuck?"</p>
        <p>
          He raised his gaze, and our eyes locked. The tip of his pink tongue
          ran over his bottom lip, and I had the strongest urge to kiss him.
        </p>
        <p>Yes. I'm horny as fuck right now. Pill doing a good job.</p>
        <p>
          "Hm, yes." He responded. "But I don't necessarily like them; I have to
          like something about them before I fuck them. And It's always a
          one-time thing. Because of my at—"
        </p>
        <p>"Attachment issues. When was your first time?"</p>
        <p>"Seventeen...yours?"</p>
        <p>
          "Same." He knew that was a lie but didn't care enough to call my
          bluff. "First kiss?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes searched mine before he swallowed and said, "I don't have
          one."
        </p>
        <p>I won't deny it; that caught me by surprise. "That's a lie."</p>
        <p>"I have no reason to lie."</p>
        <p>"But you've been with women—"</p>
        <p>"You can fuck someone without kissing them, Zahra."</p>
        <p>"And they don't get offended?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't think they realize it. My cock is all the distraction they
          need."
        </p>
        <p>
          My lips curled, and my hand moved from his arm to his thigh. He tensed
          up even more at my touch, but he didn't ask me to stop, and I didn't.
          "Would you like to kiss me, Elio?" I asked, breathing through my
          slightly parted lips, my anticipation growing.
        </p>
        <p>"It's too intimate." He spoke.</p>
        <p>"Well, would you like to fuck me then?"</p>
        <p>
          His pupils grew large, lust covering the dark, somber sense his eyes
          had carried earlier, and I fucking lived for it.
        </p>
        <p>"Absolutely fucking not." He answered.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered to his crotch, spotting his hard-on. "Yeah, but
          you're so hard it looks painful," I said, pressing my thighs together
          to ease the fervent need between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's normal. I'm intoxicated with a pill that gets me high and
          horny, you're touching my thigh, and we're talking about sex. I'm
          bound to get hard."
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed the change in his breathing, the way he couldn't keep his
          gaze from falling to my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed my hand from his thigh and slid Dog's jacket off me, aching
          my back a little. The action had his eyes dropping to my chest, and I
          was positive he was looking at the outline of my pierced nipples.
        </p>
        <p>What the fuck am I doing?</p>
        <p>Blame it on the drug...it's the drugs.</p>
        <p>
          I watched Elio swallow before tentatively raising his gaze to lock
          with mine. "Zahra—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved. Raised from my position, and straddled his thigh, angling the
          heat between my legs over his erection. A shivering breath left me
          when I settled my hands on his shoulders and dropped my throbbing clit
          against his hard-on, the fabric of my panties and his pants, the only
          thing stopping skin-to-skin contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck," Elio breathed out, voice edgy and hoarse, and I felt myself
          grow wetter at the sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our gazes locked, and Elio's big hands covered the space between my
          hips and waist, holding me in place and stopping me from moving as his
          chest heaved. "Stop, we can't." Was it possible for someone to sound
          like sin and lust, because that's exactly how this man sounds, and it
          was fucking with my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our warmth was one, bodies connected, heat joined. And I was scorching
          with need, the need to move, rub my clit against him, create friction,
          and fucking get off because, damn hell, he felt so good against me. So
          thick, long, and hard, fuck—I wanted to see him and touch him.
        </p>
        <p>"This is a bad fucking idea, Zahra." He grunted.</p>
        <p>"I have a thing for bad ideas."</p>
        <p>"My brother he—"</p>
        <p>
          I leaned closer to him, my chest pressing against his, nipples
          sensitive against his warm chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze dropped to my lips as I responded. "Makes it even hotter."
        </p>
        <p>
          His hips jerked, and I hissed at the spike of pleasure that shot
          through from that little friction.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of his hands remained firm on my hips while the other left to cup
          the side of my face, his fingers curling underneath my ear and the
          back of my neck, holding me in place, almost like he was stopping me
          from kissing him.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't want to do this." He rasps.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to either," I spoke.</p>
        <p>Our breathing was loud, faces only inches apart.</p>
        <p>His grip on the back of my neck tightened, and he leaned in.</p>
        <p>
          "My brother's going to kill me." He said breathily against my lips.
        </p>
        <p>"Who's gonna tell him?"</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck..." Breathing through a flare in his nostrils. "You're a bad
          influence, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"So, I've been to—"</p>
        <p>
          Warmth covered my lips; soft, tentative, sweet heat that made my
          senses tingle in a wave to suck all the air from my lungs. The fast
          pace my heart had been thumping staggered a millisecond, like a
          glitch—a glitch caused by the firm press of his lips to mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was embarrassing how fast I melted. Kisses meant nothing to me. But
          this—fuck—a kiss had never abruptly stolen my breath—no, not stolen,
          it had sucked it out of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost like he had been testing the waters, he removed his lips from
          mine, unsure gaze flickering to mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shamelessly took in oxygen like I was starved for it, the taste from
          his lips supplying me with a dazed edge.
        </p>
        <p>That's not enough.</p>
        <p>
          I gripped his shirt, pulling his body back to mine, as I joined our
          lips together again.
        </p>
        <p>
          My stomach flipped at how plush, warm, and perfect his lips were, and
          the moment he parted them, I wanted a taste so desperately that I
          darted my tongue into his mouth, seeking his, which carefully came to
          brush and curl around mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          A soft moan left my throat at the same time a groan vibrated from his
          chest.
        </p>
        <p>Fuck me—kissing this mouth is an addiction waiting to happen.</p>
        <p>
          Our tongues would rub against each other for a bit before it
          materialized into a kiss that sounded so intimate and exquisite.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tasted like the beer he had taken, hot, mature, and intoxicating.
          My senses, asides from the one between my legs, head, and the fiery
          feeling peppering my skin, were non-existent.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand on my waist pulled, urging me to move against him, and I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grinding on his erection and creating hot friction that sent shivers
          up my spine and compelled goosebumps on my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hips moved, and I moaned at the added pressure. This was not
          enough; I wanted to feel him for real.
        </p>
        <p>
          God, I was so wet, so horny for a man who wanted to slit my fucking
          throat open. This is sick. I am sick. But fuck it. I don't want to be
          healthy if this was how sickness felt like.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rubbed against him, his hand gripping my waist, trying to control my
          movement, but I wasn't having it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We broke away from the kiss, and I took a small breath before tilting
          my head to the other side, connecting our lips again while we
          dry-humped each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Body grinding against body, chasing a high that would take us over and
          under the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I increased my pace, breaking our kiss and thriving on the feverish
          breath he let out, lips parted in ecstasy and lust.
        </p>
        <p>His hand lowered to my ass, trying to control my movement.</p>
        <p>"My pace." He gritted out, holding firm on the back of my neck.</p>
        <p>"No...<i>my</i> pace," I countered.</p>
        <p>
          His hard stare held mine, and I felt a sharp spine-snapping pain on my
          ass.
        </p>
        <p>He fucking pinched me, and the pain had me soaking wet for him.</p>
        <p>
          "My fucking pace," He repeated, hand back to my waist, stopping my
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>I gave in.</p>
        <p>
          We went at his pace; he controlled my hips, and my eyes fucking rolled
          when he grounded his erection into my heat. My nightgown riding up
          altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know someone could be good at dry humping. What the fuck is
          this... "Fuck..." I breathed out, throwing my head back at the
          sensations hitting me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was driving me to the edge, and I'd never wanted to come so bad. I
          knew the pill could get you horny, yes...but I didn't think it could
          make you feel this good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio grunted deep in his chest as he cursed, a breathy moan escaping
          him afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound sent tantalizing flutters to my stomach, and I felt myself
          reaching the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our heated gazes locked again, and I didn't look away from him, not
          wanting to miss how beautiful he looked right now, brows pinched, eyes
          in a daze, lips parted in lust.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment, I wanted more than anything to see how he'd look in
          the heat of skin-to-skin pleasure. At the edge, about to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thoughts and the pressure of his hard length had my toes curling
          with foreign sensations, and I was almost fucking there; the buildup
          was quickly ramping up for release...fuck <i>we</i> were almost—
        </p>
        <p>The roof door pushed open. "Marino, are you out here!"</p>
        <p>
          I scrambled off him instantly, pushing my gown down, my panties soaked
          and uncomfortable. Annoyance gripped my bones at the interruption that
          slapped reality back into our faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was racing. Unsatisfaction still thumping between my legs,
          seeking warmth and a little friction I knew would get me off. But
          thank you fucking orgasm-restricting universe!
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio adjusted himself, and I tried to calm my breathing as footsteps
          stopped, and I looked to the side at Angelo, whose form stood frozen
          upon spotting us.
        </p>
        <p>
          My breathing refused to be calm, but the man beside me was as calm as
          a dove. His breathing was back to normal, face void of any indication
          that we'd both been about to get each other off—what the fuck?
        </p>
        <p>My pulse was still thudding abnormally.</p>
        <p>"Uh..." Angelo started. "...am I—am I interrupting something?"</p>
        <p>"Ye—"</p>
        <p>
          "No!" I spoke over Elio's voice, shooting him a glare as I staggered
          to my feet, grabbing the jacket and slipping it back on. "I was just
          leaving."
        </p>
        <p>Elio's head snapped up to look at me. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          I glanced down at him, catching the displeasure lining his brows, his
          calm façade shifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, my heart hammering as I forced a very strained smile at
          Angelo, before walking quickly toward the roof door.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped halfway through and turned sharply to a still-stunned
          Angelo, whose eyes were wide and unsure as if he was trying to put two
          and two together, but the results were impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's high on drugs, and it will wear out probably in a few hours," I
          informed.
        </p>
        <p>"What the—"</p>
        <p>"Anything he says, it's a lie. Night Angie."</p>
        <p>"Angie?"</p>
        <p>
          I scurried out the door and down the anxiety-rising staircase without
          waiting to hear what else he would say.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note to self: Never take Dog's pills near Elio Marino's dwellings. My
          heart was still crazy—because what the fuck just happened? And how the
          fuck do we come back from that...Devil—oh shit...
        </p>
        <p><i>It's the pill. </i>My mind assured.</p>
        <p>Even though I felt very fucking sober right now—</p>
        <p>It's because of the pill.</p>
        <p>Blame it on the pill. </p>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p><b>I HAVE </b>lost my mind.</p>
        <p>
          I always prided myself on my ability to wield control. To pull back
          when I knew I was breaching a line I shouldn't and couldn't cross. But
          tonight, my sense of reasoning had drifted into the open sky above me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment my mind decided it was okay to pull down my walls and let
          that pestilent woman see a side of me I reserved for people who were
          innocent to things of my world, I knew I was compromised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sex was sacred to me because I knew how many men in my field had
          fallen due to the body of a woman; her smiles and curves, the soft
          voice that would make a man wonder what exactly she would sound like
          when he buried himself inside her.
        </p>
        <p>
          For years, I had deprived myself the intimacy that came with sexual
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>For precisely three reasons.</p>
        <p>
          One was distraction. I couldn't afford it. The fear of missing out on
          something important while doing something as measly as fucking a woman
          was very close to home. I couldn't afford a mistake like that again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two; My attachment issues. Becoming attached to a woman who would only
          want me for what my body had to offer was as useless as the act of
          fucking itself. I will not delude myself and say that as a new adult,
          I hadn't longed for the intimacy that came with being in a
          relationship or the absolution that grew with the bond of marriage.
        </p>
        <p>I was open to it. Close to doing it, in fact.</p>
        <p>
          At twenty-eight, I was swayed by the beauty of Grace Alden, the woman
          Zahra and I had run into at the exhibit. I was impressed by Her simple
          nature, the way she seemed to know when it was time to talk and time
          to listen. She didn't challenge me, didn't question me. She was like
          her name, graceful. She proved no drama or difficulty when handling
          her, and she was the perfect candidate for a partner. But then, I
          realized she was pretty...boring, and I would only be subjecting her
          to a marriage where death was inevitable for her husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized that it was useless. So, I dropped the thought. I told her
          that I was not ready for a serious relationship. Grace had offered to
          keep satisfying me sexually until I was ready. And this brings me to
          my third reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Respect. Seeing how my father had handled the issue with Elia's mother
          and how he had disrespected my mother countless times afterward,
          flaunting the women he practiced infidelity with, I'd vowed never to
          be like him. To respect women. It was why I was never with the same
          woman twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was why I could finger-count the very few women I had been with in
          my whole existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace being the fourth and second to the last, I'd only been with her
          once, and I made sure it never happened again because I knew if it
          did, I'd most definitely enter into a relationship with her because I
          wasn't about to fuck a woman more than once for the sake of pleasure.
          It would have to mean something.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't just act out of pure lust. My actions were continuously
          measured and calculated before even carrying them out.
        </p>
        <p>This was precisely why my mind was spiraling.</p>
        <p>I was aware that it wasn't the drug.</p>
        <p>
          On several occasions, I had admitted to being attracted to Zahra
          because I conceded that it was normal. I was a full-blooded man,
          always finding myself in the presence of an aggravating attractive
          woman who was sharp-mouthed and provoked useless emotions from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing her walk to that railing, wearing the excuse of a nightgown,
          which exposed long tormenting legs and smooth thighs that delivered
          sinful images to my mind's eye, I knew I had to be on guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the minute she sat beside me, opening that mouth to talk to me and
          ask me questions no one had ever bothered to ask, I just couldn't shut
          up. I couldn't stop myself from bringing out the Elio Marino, who
          lived outside his head, and far away from the chaos that was compelled
          by his last name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her presence was hot and cold. Sometimes she drove me to the brink of
          wanting to actually go through with killing her...and sometimes, like
          tonight, she pushed me out of my head into a comforting place where I
          had no reason to hide or pretend I was a well-packaged psychopath.
        </p>
        <p>It scared me.</p>
        <p>She scared me.</p>
        <p>
          I should be thanking Angelo for interrupting and stopping me from
          doing something I wouldn't be able to take back, but I surprised
          myself by picturing his body mysteriously falling over the railing,
          with me standing behind it, watching him plummet to his death, for
          choosing this time to check on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the way she had rushed out, separating herself from me like it
          would end the world if anyone found out we'd been that close, had me
          feeling...strange.
        </p>
        <p>I was annoyed, yes.</p>
        <p>But I was confused even more than I was annoyed.</p>
        <p>I liked kissing her.</p>
        <p>
          I had done it because I momentarily forgot the meaning of control,
          credit to her hot heat against the strain on my crotch and those
          pierced hard nipples pressing against my chest. But more than
          anything, there was an aching I needed to please, one that tugged deep
          in my stomach, one I had never felt before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips called to mine, and I wanted a taste, even though I knew it
          was a cretinous thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>But she had run away from me...why?</p>
        <p>Did she hate it?</p>
        <p>
          Did the intoxication of the drug fade from her eyes and show her who
          exactly kissed her?
        </p>
        <p>Was she appalled by it? by me?</p>
        <p>
          Was she worried about what Devil would think? Fucking hell—what would
          he think?
        </p>
        <p>
          He would kill me, for that I'm certain. She was his, and I had just
          ruined that.
        </p>
        <p>But it was terrific for me; I won't lie.</p>
        <p>
          It was intimate and rapturously addicting, but was I the only one who
          felt it? Did I do it wrong?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was inescapable. I knew I would obsess over this until I got an
          answer. I would waste precious time dissecting the look of irritation
          and discomfort in her eyes the moment she rushed to her feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace had tried to kiss me a couple of times; if I had succumbed and
          kissed her, would she have looked at me the same way, or was this
          because Zahra hated me?
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I have never hated anyone as much as I hate you!"</i> her voice
          echoed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe that's why? But why would she stop me from hurting myself if she
          hated me? Why would she ask me questions about why I couldn't sleep?
          Why does she—fuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was threading through a territory I knew I shouldn't cross. All
          through the day, this woman refused to leave my mind. I'd asked myself
          similar questions to the ones plaguing my mind now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did she care, stopping me from ending it all? Why didn't she get
          nervous and scared around me? Why didn't she drive away from me? What
          was she up to today? Did she tell Devil about what happened? Where did
          she keep my gun? Why did she keep it?
        </p>
        <p>
          When she'd told me she had to get away from everyone, I had a burning
          desire to ask, and I would have asked what happened, but I knew I
          couldn't get invested.
        </p>
        <p>I knew little about her.</p>
        <p>
          I'd found she had some history with some self-made mobster in Sicily,
          but I didn't know how deep it ran or how she was here in Italy. I knew
          nothing. I needed to stop wondering and asking questions, but a part
          of me also knew it was too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if picturing Angelo's death wasn't proof, I don't know what is.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I most definitely interrupted something, didn't I?" Angelo said, a
          wary in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked out of my head, looking up at him. "Every human has two
          angels, the good one that rests on the right shoulder, and the bad
          that rests on the left."
        </p>
        <p>Angelo frowned. "I don't..." he trailed off.</p>
        <p>
          "You're the good one. The one always giving advice that I would never
          follow and popping in when I don't even need you. The one I'd love to
          squish, but I can't because I happen to like you. How fortunate you
          and unfortunate for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He opened his mouth to say something—closed it, opened it again,
          before finally closing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My lips lifted in irritation as I watched him try to find an excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cleared his throat, standing straighter, hair rough as if he had
          just gotten out of bed. "I didn't know you wouldn't be alone, Marino,
          and—the girl was the last person I expected you to be with—are you
          fucking her?"
        </p>
        <p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>
        <p>"I mean—something was happening, the way she rushed—"</p>
        <p>"And how is any of that your business?"</p>
        <p>
          "It's not, but it's unlike you. I mean, you did try to drown her
          before, so...it's just—you don't, you and women—I've never...."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Go on, Angelo, I've heard you form consecutive sentences before. You
          can do it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "You're right; it's none of my business. But if you
          are...involved with her or...want to be, or would soon be? I can ask
          my people to carry out intensive research on Martino Conti—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Leave it to me," I said, getting to my feet, surprisingly without
          staggering. I felt very sober but still a little light. "No one does
          any search on her. I doubt you would find anything useful."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo's eyes widened with surprise as he watched me. "My God. You
          didn't deny it."
        </p>
        <p>"Deny what?"</p>
        <p>
          "That you're involved with her, or would want to be, or would soon be
          involved with her."
        </p>
        <p>
          I bend to pick up the empty beer bottle on the ground, straightening
          before walking to the end of the chair and leaning on it. "Why? Are
          you interested in her?"
        </p>
        <p>"Of course not."</p>
        <p>"In me, then?"</p>
        <p>He gave me a blank look.</p>
        <p>"What? You are awfully invested in this. I only want to confirm."</p>
        <p>"I am not interested in you, Marino."</p>
        <p>"Okay, why are you so concerned then."</p>
        <p>
          "Because I <i>am</i> concerned. I don't trust her. I'm usually not
          this skeptical about people. But—something about that woman ticks me
          off the wrong way, and I don't want you...." he trailed off.
        </p>
        <p>"Carry on." I urged with my hands.</p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "I've never seen you with anyone, not since Grace. So I
          know if this thing with Zahra is a thing, then it might be serious for
          you, and we know little about her to conclude if she is to be
          trusted."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one is to be trusted, Angelo. Besides, as far as the situation is
          right now, there is nothing between her and me. I appreciate that you
          care, but I am not a child. If I need relationship advice, I will come
          to you, but I don't need it."
        </p>
        <p>He nodded. "Alright."</p>
        <p>
          "Good. Now, about that phone. I was hoping to discuss it when it's
          daytime, but I might as well tell you now. I need one."
        </p>
        <p>He blinked at me like he hadn't heard me well.</p>
        <p>"You...you need a phone?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. What is wrong with you today? Why are you lagging? Should I be
          worried?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I'm just surprised. I've been trying for years to get you to get
          a phone, but you've always refused, so I'm a little shocked that you
          want one all of a sudden." He said, and when I didn't respond, he
          rearranged his previous blabber because he didn't exactly ask a
          question. "Why do you want a phone all of a sudden?"
        </p>
        <p>"Someone might be expecting my text."</p>
        <p>"Someone..."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," I leaned off the chair, walking past him. "a very kind woman
          who gave me a ride in her car. She gave me her number and asked me to
          text her. She's my friend. Her name's Gemma."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So...a stranger is the reason you're getting a phone after all my
          efforts over the years?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes," I said, opening the roof door.</p>
        <p>
          "That doesn't hurt my feelings at all." He said, following after me.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm glad it doesn't."</p>
        <p>"That was sarcasm."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm afraid I am under the influence; I can't tell the differences.
          Minutes ago, the moon was smiling at me." I said, climbing down the
          stairs.
        </p>
        <p>"I want to push you," he said.</p>
        <p>"You'd be doing me a favor."</p>
        <p>He groaned.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, before I forget. Arrange a meeting with STREET when the sun is
          up. I have a job offer for them."
        </p>
        <p>"Noted."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          <b>THE CHIHUAHUA</b> painting was lying flat on the board table the
          next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the group arrived, I discarded my suit and left just my black
          button-up with a tie. I had paced the length of the multi-purpose
          space at the cassino's top solely because I was restless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro had begrudgingly asked what the matter was with me, but I
          couldn't exactly explain to him that my always controlled nerves had
          broken out in hives because a certain woman had walked away from me
          after I kissed her. So, I just settled for doing what I do best,
          lighting up a cigar and ignoring him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment STREET walked in, my pacing stopped as I blew out the smoke
          I had drawn in, my gaze zeroing in on the entrance as they filed in.
        </p>
        <p>Something was off. They weren't relaxed—none of them.</p>
        <p>
          Milk had an anxious and wary look; Dog looked pissed, Upper looked
          sick, and Devil wore almost the same look as Zahra, completely blank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo followed behind them, locking the door as they settled like
          they had the last time they'd been here.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze briefly locked with Zahra's, but she didn't give anything
          away. Instead, it looked like she had stared through a transparent
          wall.
        </p>
        <p>The silence in the room was deafening until Dog broke it.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, that's one ugly dog. It's even uglier in person; how's that
          possible?" He remarked, eying the painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Angelo said you had an offer for us; we'd like to go straight to the
          point, please." Devil voiced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro glanced at me, and I could read the question in his mind.
          <i>What the fuck happened to them.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked back to the head of the table, took my seat, and exercised my
          time in accessing the group. I should have asked Zahra why she left
          the house last night because whatever it is, it's ruining their
          formation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I searched inside me for the satisfaction of this new development but
          couldn't find it, so I chose to ignore it altogether. The matter on
          ground was more important than their off day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am well aware that you all know about the dealings with the
          painting. About Arturo Garza's quest." I said into the silence,
          waiting for any of them to chip in with a response, but there was
          just...silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's a shock," Casmiro muttered, relaxing back on his chair beside
          me, watching the group with a smile of amusement. I knew he loved
          it—the conflict in their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll take your silence for a yes," I added. "A lot of men like me are
          on the hunt for the original painting, and—"
        </p>
        <p>"Why are you on the hunt for it?" Devil asked.</p>
        <p>"The gold, why else?"</p>
        <p>
          "Bullshit," Zahra muttered with a scoff, but she didn't look at me.
          Her jaw was locked, and her index finger circled the table, eyes
          focused on the painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And why would you insinuate that?" I asked, still looking at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expected her to give me her infamous challenging look, but she
          didn't even look up once as she said. "Everybody in this room knows
          that you don't give a shit about the gold. You have triple the amount
          it promises to fetch, resting in your bank account, Marino."
        </p>
        <p><i>Marino?</i></p>
        <p>I bottled that.</p>
        <p>"Alright, since we're going to be working together—"</p>
        <p>Her head shot up, eyes locking with mine. "Working together?"</p>
        <p>
          I held her gaze. "Yes, Zahra. I plan to hire you for a job. You and
          the rest of your team will help me find the original painting."
        </p>
        <p>Milk's eyes widened as she looked around the group.</p>
        <p>
          The confused look in Zahra's eyes quickly changed into a glare. "I'm
          sorry to break it to you, but we're already planning to go after it on
          our own."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog scoffed. "I wonder how that's gonna work when no one is talking to
          anyone. Might as well get out there and get fucking killed." He
          muttered.
        </p>
        <p>Devil aimed a glare his way. "Maybe shut the fuck up?"</p>
        <p>
          "Me?" Dog sat up. "Oh, you're asking for a fucking punch because you
          caused this whole motherfucking bullshit."
        </p>
        <p>"Fellas, not here." Upper spoke into the tense silence.</p>
        <p>
          Dog turned to him in his seat. "Don't even get me started on you, you
          little shithead."
        </p>
        <p>"Don't talk to him like that," Devil warned.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra sat up, turning to Devil with wide eyes as she clapped her hands
          together once, shooting him a mock appreciative smile. "Wow, you're
          one to talk about <i>how</i>to talk to him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, Devil leveled her with a glare. "I wasn't fucking
          talking to you."
        </p>
        <p>
          A gasp left Zahra, and she gritted out. "Somebody fucking hold me
          because I'm about to punch a motherfucker in the face."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Before you do that," I cut in, blowing out my smoke calmly, pressing
          the lit cigar to the ashtray beside me, quenching the fire. "I was
          wondering if maybe we can all return to the matter at hand; that would
          be splendid."
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence fell on them, but I could still see withheld anger from Dog,
          Zahra, and Devil while Milk and Upper sat there in utter discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was getting good," Casmiro said, straightening his suit, leaning
          on the table, and joining his hands together. "But yes, the matter at
          hand is important. I don't know what you and your crew were thinking,
          Zahra, but if I remember correctly, you are under Marino's command, so
          even if you wanted to hunt for the original on your own, it wouldn't
          be possible. You answer to us."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're not going on a suicide mission unless we know why you want the
          painting so bad," Zahra said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I released a breath, weighing my options before coming to a decision.
          I motioned to Angelo to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There are very important flash drives kept with the gold," Angelo
          informed. "These flash drives contain intel regarding someone of the
          wealthiest men in and out of this business."
        </p>
        <p>Devil perked up. "By information, you mean...."</p>
        <p>"Self-destructing."</p>
        <p>Dog whistled. "Well, ain't that something."</p>
        <p>"What's in it for us?" Zahra asked this time.</p>
        <p>"The gold," Angelo responded.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra shook her head. "Oh no, we'll get the gold, I know that. But
          you're hiring us for this...what do we get out of it?" she directed
          the question to me, and everyone waited for my response.
        </p>
        <p>There was always a catch with this woman.</p>
        <p>Smart.</p>
        <p>
          "Alright." I bit my tongue hard before I let my next words through.
          "You get your freedom—all of you. If you find the painting, get the
          gold and the flash drives. You're free."
        </p>
        <p>"Now, that's a fucking deal." Dog spoke up.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra still looked skeptical, like she was thinking it through. After
          a while, she shook her head. "I say yes, to the freedom, but...I want
          something more. Apparently, we're not the only ones hunting for this
          painting. We might be good, but some people have been looking for this
          thing longer than we have. We might get one-upped; we might lose our
          lives." She said.
        </p>
        <p>"She has a point," Upper said.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra leveled me with a stern professional look. "One hundred million
          dollars, and we'll consider helping you find those flash drives."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "You already get the gold."</p>
        <p>
          "We're risking our lives on a 'maybe we'll find the original painting
          and get the gold.' It's not certain. The payment guarantees that even
          if we don't find the gold, we're not risking our lives for nothing."
          She turned to her group. "Is that all right with everyone?"
        </p>
        <p>"That's perfect." Milk said.</p>
        <p>"I'm game." Dog agreed.</p>
        <p>Upper shrugged. "It's better than five thousand dollars."</p>
        <p>Devil only shrugged, like he couldn't care less.</p>
        <p>"So," Zahra looked back at me. "Do we have a deal, Marino?"</p>
        <p>
          "This is ridiculous." Casmiro's voice was soaked with disbelief.
          "They're in no position to be cutting deals; we already agree to grant
          them their freedom; that's quite enough, in my opinion." He said when
          he realized I was actually thinking about it.
        </p>
        <p>"I agree with Casmiro," Angelo said.</p>
        <p>Their freedom was inevitable.</p>
        <p>
          The money was nothing. I won't need it where I'm going. This all is
          nothing if I find that flash drive. Casmiro doesn't know that.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few minutes of pondering, I sat up straighter, clearing my
          throat. "We have a deal, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you fucking kidding me." Casmiro hissed, relaxing back on the
          chair with a look of annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra gave a curt nod. "I would like that to be stated in a certified
          contract to avoid future misinterpretations."
        </p>
        <p>"As you wish."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shot me a bewildered look, leaning towards me while he said
          quietly. "Tell me there's an explanation for this."
        </p>
        <p>"Have you ever known me to do things without reason, Casmiro?"</p>
        <p>He shook his head.</p>
        <p>"Good. We'll talk in extension later. For now, trust me."</p>
        <p>He sneaked a look at Angelo, who shrugged.</p>
        <p>"Fine."</p>
        <p>
          I turned my attention back to the group. "From your interactions, I
          believe there are issues needed to be solved amongst your group. I am
          not hiring a bunch of children who can't air out their disputes and
          separate them from their work; I'm hiring the people who stole from me
          and claimed to be shadows of Italy. You're dismissed in hopes that I'm
          not making a mistake. When I have a word for you, you'll be informed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil was the first to shoot up from his seat, walking out like the
          environment was on fire. Dog followed suit with a curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, will you stay back a minute, please," I said, gesturing to
          Casmiro and Angelo to excuse us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question in Casmiro's eyes was evident, but he didn't question it.
          Angelo, though, shot me a familiar look, the one he had worn when he
          told me not to trust her.
        </p>
        <p>But he didn't air out his concerns.</p>
        <p>Zahra stood up but did not attempt to leave.</p>
        <p>I got to my feet when everyone left, and it was just us two.</p>
        <p>
          "What is this about?" she asked, crossing her arms against her chest.
          "Do you want to add something to the contract?" she eyed me
          suspiciously.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't appreciate how she acted like the previous night didn't
          happen. I can't beat around the bush or ignore things my head refuses
          to forget.
        </p>
        <p>"It is unrelated to work," I said, walking to her.</p>
        <p>
          When I got close, she raised her chin, locking her jaw—determination
          in those stubborn eyes.
        </p>
        <p>I leaned on the table before her, a foot distance between us.</p>
        <p>
          Mirroring her actions by crossing my arms, I watched her swallow, her
          eyes glazing over momentarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you tell my brother? Is that why there's animosity between you
          both."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mock confusion brought down her brows. "What are you talking about?
          Tell Devil what?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Annoyance prickled in me, but I tamped it down. "Do not pretend you
          don't know what I'm talking about."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe you just need to be specific."</p>
        <p>
          She stared me down, and I honestly did not want to waste more time on
          this. "The rooftop, last night."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mock realization filled her eyes. "Oh, that. What's there to tell? It
          was nothing."
        </p>
        <p>"I beg to differ. We need to talk about it."</p>
        <p>
          She sighed, dropping her hands. "There's nothing to talk about,
          Marino—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stop. Stop calling me that." My annoyance and irritation flared as I
          cut her off.
        </p>
        <p>"It's your name."</p>
        <p>"That's not what you call me."</p>
        <p>She shrugged. "Well, get used to it, Marino."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned. Not many things throw me off guard, but her attitude right
          now was answering all the questions that had been taunting my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What happened?" I asked in Spanish carefully; you might even think
          there was a genuine softness to my voice—maybe there was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra's eyes widened, showing that she hadn't expected me to ask. But
          she collected herself quickly, and I saw how she locked her shoulders,
          raising her guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever happened is none of your business." She responded in
          English. "Like I said," she continued. "There is nothing to talk
          about, and honestly," she let out a humorless laugh that shook at the
          end. "I'm in a very terrible mood right now, and I can't dissect
          whatever happened on that rooftop or why the fuck you would want to
          talk about it but get this, we were high out of our minds, okay? It
          was a fucked-up night, filled with raging hormones, and we shared a
          stupid fucking kiss and tried to get each other off until we were
          interrupted; thank God for that."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was silent for what seemed like a long minute. I had nothing to
          say. No—my mouth felt too dry, and I had the strongest urge to drink
          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          She shifted on her feet. "So, if you'd excuse me, I'd like to go back
          to that house and pretend like the people I call family don't exist
          until I have to work with them again."
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to find thoughts, but they were very silent at the moment, so
          I just nodded, looking away from her and motioning to the door as I
          said. "Of course."
        </p>
        <p>
          I had seen rejection. I know it. I know what this is. I wasn't
          surprised. I am not surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hesitated to leave for a bit, and when I looked back at her, I
          caught what seemed like regret in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>She sighed. "Listen, E—"</p>
        <p>"You've cleared up my concerns. You can leave now."</p>
        <p>
          Her throat bobbed up and down, and she let out a shaky breath before
          nodding. "Okay..." her eyes searched mine for a few seconds before she
          turned on her heel and left the space, closing the door behind her and
          subjecting me to silence.
        </p>
        <p>I remained in my position staring at the closed door.</p>
        <p>For how long, I had no idea.</p>
        <p>But finally, after so long, I had one thought.</p>
        <p>No—one affirmation.</p>
        <p>
          I had wasted valuable time asking questions I should have seen the
          answers to upfront, and I should probably punish myself for how
          useless the last 10 hours had been and for losing control like that on
          the rooftop.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I knew I would also be wasting my time punishing myself, so I'd
          learn the lesson from this experience instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a <i>stupid fucking kiss</i>; therefore, it's something I'll
          never repeat.
        </p>
        <p>Probably for as long as I breathe. </p>

        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>EVEN THROUGH </b>my headphones, I could hear the soft knocking on
          my door, one which I'd been ignoring for almost two minutes now. I
          pressed my eyelids together tightly, a flimsy attempt to block out my
          thoughts and center my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't in a good place. I was too in my head. A lot of thoughts
          plagued my mind. I didn't know which to focus on. Devil and Upper
          being involved in some way. Milk knowing about it, Dog suspecting and
          not saying anything to me. The incident at the rooftop with Elio,
          which hadn't stopped playing a tune in my head...the warmth of his
          lips that had me pressing mine together every time to remember how it
          felt subconsciously.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't stop thinking about it and him. which was very fucking
          inconvenient because I didn't need this.
        </p>
        <p><i>I don't need this. </i></p>
        <p>
          Because it wasn't just that I was attracted to him, I cared. As much
          as I love to deny it, I fucking cared. This wasn't predetermined. It
          just happened, and I hate it, and him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd love to think that it's centered chiefly towards the guilt, but
          it's not; because I panicked—when he asked me to wait behind, I felt a
          weird dip in my stomach because I was hoping he wouldn't remember—I
          didn't want to talk about it. I should have known he would address it
          because he didn't seem like a man who would shy away from something
          like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil was safe. He wasn't like the other men who...who I'd been with;
          he was pretty normal, but Elio—Elio was exactly like the people I had
          fought tooth and nail to escape from.
        </p>
        <p>
          He killed a child, for God's sake, tried to drown me, shot and
          tortured me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's threatened to kill me more times than I can count, and yet,
          <i>yet</i> I can't help but be drawn to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I once suspected that I had a particular problem. A problem that drew
          me toward people like Elio. A problem I'd only just registered as a
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want to overthink it or give it importance, but the look on
          his face when I'd written it all off as nothing...
        </p>
        <p>
          I groaned in annoyance, snapping my eyes back open and staring at the
          ceiling for a few seconds too long before my gaze traveled to the
          door.
        </p>
        <p>The knocking continued, and I took off my headphones, sighing.</p>
        <p>
          "It's open," I called out, sitting up as the door pushed open an inch.
          Upper was peeking in like I would jump off the bed and attack him if
          he so much as breathed the same air as me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you want?" I asked him, turning off the music from my new
          phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I just—" he fumbled. "I wanted to—" he stood upright, swallowing.
          "Can we talk?" he asked, unable to shield the nervousness in his
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to refuse and ask him to leave me alone, but I nodded,
          gesturing for him to sit on my bed by patting a space on the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          He walked in, closed the door, and settled a few inches away from me
          on the mattress, his movement cautious as he watched me. "Hey." he
          started.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," I responded, raking my fingers through my hair as I relaxed,
          watching him struggle with what to say next.
        </p>
        <p>
          His dark brown hair was rough, and circles were underneath his eyes;
          Even his infamous one pair of ear-ring was missing, and his neck
          chains were gone too; it was weird seeing him so...bare. He looked so
          stressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Listen, Zahra, I know...I know my apology would mean shit to you—"
        </p>
        <p>"Actually, I'd take an apology," I told him honestly.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes went wide, even though they were filled with uncertainty.
          "You're serious?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "You both fucked up, and the least either of you could have
          done was to actually apologize for treating me like the damn fool in
          all this."
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips parted, and he shifted closer to me, eyes pleading. "I
          promise you; it was not my intention. I swear on my life and
          everything I hold dear that I never wanted to hurt you with this
          revelation. The first time it happened, I—I wanted to tell you, but I
          was scared that this whole thing would happen, and now that it is
          happening, I feel like a pound of bloody arseholish-shit, and I, I am
          <i>so</i> sorry, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him, shocked a little by the sincerity in his words, but
          what surprised me more was how his accent had gone more profound; he
          sounded almost elegant, even with the—weird curse word.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shot him a confused look as I asked. "What the fuck is a pound of
          bloody arseholish-shit?"
        </p>
        <p>He breathed out a laugh, and I joined with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>
          He looked down, but before he did, I caught the glassy haze in his
          eyes, and when he sniffed, I shifted closer to him.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey," I called, trying to catch his gaze.</p>
        <p>
          He shook and raised his head, sucking in a shaky breath as he wiped
          off his tears and forced out a laugh. "Sorry, I know this is not—this
          is not the bloody Upper version of myself," he swallowed, refusing to
          meet my gaze as he mumbled. "whomever the fuck that is."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart melted there and then, and I couldn't believe I was slightly
          mad at him.
        </p>
        <p>"Upper—"</p>
        <p>"I promise I'm not some crybaby."</p>
        <p>
          "I happen to love crybabies," I said, ruffling his already-ruffled
          hair. His teary eyes met mine, and he smiled sheepishly at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm usually not a mess like this..." he said, looking down again.
          "it's just—this whole thing has dreaded up awful memories from before,
          and the last thing I want is to be the reason why a family like ours
          gets separated. I always fuck things up for people I care about, and
          my biggest fear is...is doing that to STREET."
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to ask what he was talking about because it seemed to really
          be bothering him. "You're not fucking up anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No, I am. Look at us. I know it's just been a day,
          but—we've never gone this long being hostile with each other, and it's
          all because I couldn't stop myself from feeling."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one should ever stop themselves from feeling what they want to
          feel, Upper. You're one of the best people I know; you couldn't even
          ruin a family if you tried."
        </p>
        <p>
          He went silent for a long moment before he swallowed and said, "I
          could."
        </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "I did it...almost ruined a family...a big one. It's the reason why
          I'm in this bloody country. Away from everyone that I—" he stopped,
          the thickness of tears in his voice blocking his next words from
          coming through.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rubbed his back. "Hey, I know you. Whatever happened, I'm sure it's
          not your fault. I'm positive it's not."
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled. "I want to believe that. But you should have seen how I was
          packaged like an abomination. All that happened when they didn't even
          know my sexuality; imagine how they'd treat me if they knew."
        </p>
        <p>"Upper—"</p>
        <p>
          "I can't stay, Zahra." He blurted, and my hand movement on his back
          stopped.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
        <p>
          He worried his bottom lip with his teeth. "I can't stay here...with
          STREET. I—not after what happened; it's too fucking close to home, and
          I know I shouldn't duck tail and run, but that's how I was able to
          stop my family from breaking apart the first time."
        </p>
        <p>I dropped my hand, drawing my brows down into a frown. "Upper—"</p>
        <p>
          "I will go after we get the gold, and I'm not saying this because I
          need the money or anything like that. We started the mission together,
          and we'll end it together. After that, I'm leaving STREET."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, down the lump in my throat. "You don't have to leave,
          Upper."
        </p>
        <p>"I know, but I want to. I need to."</p>
        <p>
          "Is this because of Devil? Do I need to knock some sense into him?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head quickly. "No, no, don't—don't tell him anything. In
          fact, don't tell anyone anything."
        </p>
        <p>"That's—"</p>
        <p>
          "I'll tell them after we get the gold so it would seem as if I was
          selfish, and now that we have gold, I want to leave. That narrative
          suits me."
        </p>
        <p>"No, it doesn't."</p>
        <p>"I'll make it suit me."</p>
        <p>
          "Upper." I stopped him. "Is this because you like Devil, and he won't
          return your feelings? I can talk to him. Maybe he's just conflicted."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "Me and Devil, we're very impossible. I like him,
          yes. I really do, I more than like him, but it's not going to happen."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "How long has this been going on between you two."</p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "Four months before we got here. Not like we were doing it
          for four months, the dare happened four months ago, and the other
          stuff just—happened along the line, we didn't generally hook up, just
          like—three times, and that's it. It was nothing."
        </p>
        <p>"Did you tell him that you liked him?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head again. "There's no point. I mean nothing to him. And
          that's okay. I think he really does love you, Zahra. I confused him.
          On his behalf, I'm sorry."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't." I held his face in my hands. "None of this is your fault. It
          happened because it was meant to happen. Do you believe in reason,
          Upper?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know."</p>
        <p>
          "Well, believe in it. Because there's a reason this is happening, and
          whatever it is, I'm sure it didn't just push you into Devil's path so
          that you could force yourself out of it. Maybe Devil loves me in his
          own weird way, but I am certain that he feels more for you than he
          does me."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>
          "I think so. He wouldn't be trying this hard to run away from it if it
          meant nothing. I'll talk to him—"
        </p>
        <p>"No, please—"</p>
        <p>
          "I'll talk to him. I won't tell him you're planning—planning to leave;
          a decision I'm hoping you'd change your mind on because you're a part
          of this, you're the fucking Elegant in STREET. Without that one 'E,'
          we're incomplete."
        </p>
        <p>He smiled through tear-filled eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Come here, you crybaby." He melted into me, burying his head in my
          neck as I held him close.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, we both settled properly on my bed while he slept off in
          minutes. I was still holding him, staring up at the ceiling and
          thinking of ways to convince him to get the thought of leaving out of
          his mind.
        </p>
        <p>But somewhere along the line, I drifted off to sleep too.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Upper was still dead asleep beside me when I woke up, so I slipped off
          the bed and out of the room. He looked like he hadn't slept a wink the
          night before, just like me and probably Devil and the rest of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking down the passageway, I bumped into Milk, who let out a
          somewhat loud yelp.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus fucking Christ, Zahra." She blew out a breath, her hand on her
          chest, as she looked at me with wary. "Hi."
        </p>
        <p>"Hi, have any idea where Devil is?"</p>
        <p>"I saw him out back from the kitchen window."</p>
        <p>
          "Thanks." I was about to brush past her but stopped, leveling her with
          a firm stare. "Why didn't you tell me?"
        </p>
        <p>She blinked. "It wasn't my secret to share—"</p>
        <p>"We're supposed to have each other's backs."</p>
        <p>
          "I know, but I was—I was having both Upper and Devil's back by keeping
          my mouth shut, and I was having <i>your</i> back by bugging them to
          tell you, or I'd spill, and I didn't want you to be hurt, and I also
          didn't want them to be hurt too, and it just got so confusing and
          delicate so fast that I—I'm sorry. I should have said something."
        </p>
        <p>
          I chuckled, letting out a sigh. "We all suck because I would have also
          wanted to protect them if you were in my shoes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't think five people can be best friends. Because when one
          person has a secret that concerns another person, it's flipping hard
          to keep it because you're considering everyone's feelings and the
          fucking pressure is choking."
        </p>
        <p>"I think we're trying. And I think this whole day has been shit."</p>
        <p>
          She let out a loud sigh of relief. "I know! Dog refused to cook, so
          yes, it has been shit, and now I gotta bake; I guarantee a burnt
          dinner; sorry in advance."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't care if it's charcoal, I'll eat anything, 'cause I'm
          starving; I'll come to help soon, just gotta talk to Devil real
          quick."
        </p>
        <p>"Go easy on him," she said with a smile.</p>
        <p>"Okay, Adele. I will." I said, making my way to the backyard.</p>
        <p>
          When I opened the door, I was greeted with the golden hour sunlight
          and the cool weather that seemed to draw me towards Devil's somber
          figure, sitting on the back porch as guards walked by here and there,
          with cars entering and leaving the compound.
        </p>
        <p>I walked over to him, sitting on the space by his side.</p>
        <p>
          I stifled a yawn as I bathed in the sunlight before looking over at
          him. His skin, the same shade as Elio's, glowed under the light with a
          natural ease that had me comparing his eyelashes to his brother's. It
          wasn't as long, but it was thick and had the same shadowing grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could spot some resemblance here and there, but I looked away before
          said brother started plaguing my mind again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You look like a cute vampire under this light." I broke the silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          He scoffed a chuckle, and I caught him stealing a glance my way. "Why?
          Do I sparkle?"
        </p>
        <p>I looked at him, "No...you glow."</p>
        <p>"Real smooth, Z. A for effort."</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, I'm glad," I said with a smile, and he turned to look at
          me with a shadow of a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sorry about the board room—I was just pissed, you didn't want to talk
          to me, and the time you did, you called me out on—Upper." He sighed,
          looking away and ahead. "I'm sorry about everything. I was—I didn't
          handle it well; this thing with Upper is...confusing. I don't—I don't
          know how to separate it from my feelings for you, and I know that's a
          shitty thing to say in this situation because I don't want either of
          you to get hurt, and I—"
        </p>
        <p>My hand covered his. "Hey..."</p>
        <p>
          He sucked in a breath, intertwining our fingers before turning to look
          at me.
        </p>
        <p>"It's fine...I'm not angry anymore."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes searched mine. "No, It's not fine. I am angry. I am angry at
          myself and my feelings and how badly I fucked up. For hurting you, I
          wanted—I wanted us to be something Zahra; I love you, I know I do.
          It's just—"
        </p>
        <p>"It's different when you're with him." I completed.</p>
        <p>He swallowed, looking down at our hands together. "I'm sorry."</p>
        <p>
          "It's okay." I laughed lightly. "I don't know how I didn't see it. You
          both spend so much time together, but when we're together, you barely
          talk to each other. I should have seen it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Milk caught on first. It's not her fault she didn't tell you. Upper,
          and I wanted to tell you—but then I freaked because I feel something
          for you, and I didn't want to throw that away because being with Upper
          is so consuming, like—I fight for breath whenever he's near, and it
          fucking scares me, Zahra. Because it was so sudden, we've known each
          other for years, and I've never once thought that—I've never once seen
          him that way, and now it's—now I've fucked it up."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know love. I thought I did until the person who made me
          believe <i>I</i> did, explained how he felt when he saw me, and I
          realized I didn't feel that way; I realized I was scared, not in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          What Devil just described sounded an awful lot like the words of
          someone in love...it's crazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want that...someday. A dream, I know but—it isn't bad to dream it
          now, is it?
        </p>
        <p>"What are you gonna do about it?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Nothing." He said.</p>
        <p>"Nothing?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know, Z. I still need to work out some things and I—what
          about this—us."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know it's not going to happen, and I'm okay with that. It doesn't
          change the fact that you're my best friend and that I love you and
          will always be there for you. Our promises remain the same. You can
          cry if you want, I'd never tell anyone, you can tell me how bad you
          can't stop staring at Upper, I'll keep it till I'm six feet under,
          you'll hold my heels and purse when I finally decide I want to kill
          Dog—"
        </p>
        <p>"And you'll always have me in line?"</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed back the lump in my throat. "Of course." My voice shook,
          but I masked it with a smile. "Always."
        </p>
        <p>
          He wrapped his arms around me, pulling my body to his as he pressed a
          kiss to my hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comfortable silence settled between us as we watched the sun go
          down.
        </p>
        <p>"Why did my brother want you to stay back?"</p>
        <p>
          I froze, and he noticed because he was already pulling away from my
          body, leveling me with a look.
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing." I blurted.</p>
        <p>Devil frowned. "Why...are you lying?"</p>
        <p>
          Right, I didn't cover that up nicely. "I'm not; he just wanted to know
          what was up with everyone."
        </p>
        <p>"Why would he be asking <i>you</i> that?"</p>
        <p>I shrugged. "I guess we—we're kind of, like, friends?"</p>
        <p>His frown deepened. "Yeah...no."</p>
        <p>
          I laughed it off, backtracking. "I'm joking. He probably wanted to ask
          you, but you stormed off early, and he knows I know, and well—yeah,
          nothing serious."
        </p>
        <p>He eyed me. "You'll stay away from him."</p>
        <p>"Are you asking or telling?"</p>
        <p>
          "Neither. It's a given. You don't get close to someone like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I became surprisingly uncomfortable. "You yourself said he wasn't that
          bad."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, <i>wasn't</i>. That's until he tried to drown you and almost
          killed you; why are we even debating this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked. "We're not. Just—he's your brother, and I thought you
          wanted to get closer to him."
        </p>
        <p>"Not anymore."</p>
        <p>"He cares about you."</p>
        <p>"He pointed a gun at me."</p>
        <p>"Devil—"</p>
        <p>"Why are you defending him, Z."</p>
        <p>I hesitated. "I'm not."</p>
        <p>
          He held the side of my face, eyes searching mine. "You will stay away
          from him, right? We do this one mission, and we're out."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah."</p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>"I will stay away. I have—I have no interest. I promise." I lied.</p>
        <p>
          He let out a sigh of relief. "You scared me with the whole defending
          him thing. He's not a good guy; he's just very good at making people
          think he is."
        </p>
        <p>"Mmm."</p>
        <p>
          "Yo, quick team meeting, you shitheads." Dog yelled from the window,
          and I snorted, glad for his interruption because I was close to
          getting the air sucked out of me with this damn conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We both joined the rest in the living room. Upper was there, curled
          beside Milk, who was stroking his hair.
        </p>
        <p>He still looked sleepy, like Dog had dragged him out of my bed.</p>
        <p>
          Upper eyed us with a frown, but I smiled to let him know I said
          nothing. He visibly relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Devil and I settled on a chair next to each other, Dog clapped
          his hand once, standing in the middle of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Great, the whole family's here together. We have two options we can
          go through to clear the air and get our shits together."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's the first one?" Upper asked, and I knew it was to indulge him
          because we already cleared the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm stoked that you asked. The first one is to talk, it's very
          fucking boring, I know, but it might help if we all just—talked in the
          sense that—we tell each other one thing we've never told each other to
          rekindle our bond. We don't ask questions; we just tell."
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil relaxed back on the couch, throwing his arms around my shoulder
          and pulling me back with him. "And the second one?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have a sweaty, steamy gangbang that centers very close to a very
          sweaty orgy. We let out our frustrations by fucking each other's
          brains out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My God, you're such a man-slut." Milk said, her nose scrunched up in
          disgust.
        </p>
        <p>"That's not a bad idea." Upper spoke up drowsily.</p>
        <p>
          Dog shot his hand in Upper's direction with a grin. "See, Upper gets
          it."
        </p>
        <p>"Upper is sleep deprived." Devil pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          "Yup," Upper snuggled closer to Milk. "That's bloody right." He
          yawned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I say we give the first option a theme, like the truth behind our
          names?" Milk suggested.
        </p>
        <p>We all nodded in agreement.</p>
        <p>"Okay, so the first option, who's going first?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>"No one asks questions, right?" Devil inquired.</p>
        <p>"Yup. No question."</p>
        <p>
          "Elio Marino's my half-brother. He's The Wicked, and I'm the Devil."
          Devil blurted.
        </p>
        <p>There was silence.</p>
        <p>Upper and Milk shared the same wide-eyed look.</p>
        <p>
          Even though I knew, it didn't stop me from freezing beside him, seeing
          as he had just blurted it out.
        </p>
        <p>Just like that.</p>
        <p>"Are you serious?" Upper asked.</p>
        <p>"As a heart attack," Devil responded.</p>
        <p>"Dude," Milk breathed out.</p>
        <p>
          It turns out Devil was Devil because his brother was The Wicked. Was
          it a way to feel closer to him, probably?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog slowly took a sit on the single-seater couch. "Now that's a
          fucking foul; how can you expect us not to ask questions,
          motherfucker."
        </p>
        <p>Devil shrugged. "You made the rules."</p>
        <p>
          "My fucking God," Dog muttered. "I'll go next. Since we're starting
          with the heavy shit." He squared his shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>We all waited for him to speak, and I braced myself.</p>
        <p>
          "I had a dog named Dog. I mistakenly shot him when I was seven. With
          my mom's gun. She was a cop."
        </p>
        <p>Silence settled.</p>
        <p><i>It turns out Dog was Dog because he had a dog named Dog.</i></p>
        <p>
          "That's deep," Upper said, straightening and clasping his hands
          together.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm sorry," Milk whispered.</p>
        <p>"Yeah, thanks." Dog offered a tight smile.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll go next," Upper said. "Kinda glad we're not asking questions
          because...yeah."
        </p>
        <p>He swallowed. "I...I am a bastard prince."</p>
        <p>
          "I fucking knew this bitch was rich." Dog said with a grin that showed
          he had been suspecting.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So you didn't climb up ventilators to get education." Milk mused
          allowed. "Wow."
        </p>
        <p>Upper shrugged.</p>
        <p>Dog slapped his knees. "No wonder he's Upper, cause...."</p>
        <p>"Upper class." I completed.</p>
        <p>"Got to keep some of it," Upper said.</p>
        <p>"Still doesn't make sense," Devil said. "Just saying."</p>
        <p>I jabbed him in the ribs.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Upper was Upper because he was indeed better than everyone here.
            Incredible.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I blew out a breath. "I'll go next."</p>
        <p>The room went silent, all eyes on me.</p>
        <p>
          "I—" My throat clogged, and I cleared it. "I put that anklet on
          myself. To remember who I am. I forget sometimes."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh damn." Dog said.</p>
        <p>"Sucks that I lost it," I said with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>
          "You don't need it anymore," Devil said beside me. "We're here to
          remind you every day who you are."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I agree," Upper said with a smile, and Milk offered me a reassuring
          nod.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I guess I'm Zahra because I put an anklet on myself with my name on
            it so I'd never forget.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>"My turn." Milk said with a cautious smile.</p>
        <p>
          We all waited for her to speak, and for a moment, her eyes glazed over
          like she was remembering what she was about to divulge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I found my mother hanging from her bedroom ceiling when I was little.
          I didn't call for help, didn't leave the house. The guy who delivered
          milk to us every day was the one who noticed my mother never came to
          open the door. I survived on Milk while her body grew rotten in her
          bedroom. On the fourth day, he was concerned, so he came into the
          house and saw her. Still hanging."
        </p>
        <p>This time, the silence was heavy.</p>
        <p>"That's sad." Dog said. "I'm sorry, Milk."</p>
        <p>She nodded with an appreciative smile.</p>
        <p>
          "You're strong," I told her. "Literally, every time someone calls you
          Milk, you have to remember."
        </p>
        <p>She shrugged. "I don't want to forget."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Well, Milk was Milk because she survived on Milk while her mother
            hung from the ceiling.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't felt closer to every single one of them like I do now.
          Everything just had...meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comfortable silence settled, and a smile crept up my lips. "I love
          you guys. More than anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't need to say it back; I saw the response on their faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We should do this more often." Dog said, "Because I'd really love to
          know how the fuck he's related to Marino." He motioned to Devil.
        </p>
        <p>"And how rich Upper is," Milk added.</p>
        <p>
          "Maybe next time when we fight. For now," I got to my feet. "I'm
          fucking starving, and I need food."
        </p>
        <p>Upper sighed, holding his stomach. "Me too."</p>
        <p>
          "Come on baby, let's go see what Milk burnt." I reached him and
          outstretched my hand. He grabbed it, and I hurled him up as we headed
          to the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I haven't even started yet!" I heard Milk's voice close behind me.
        </p>
        <p>"Nobody can do anything without me." Dog muttered.</p>
        <p>
          "You gotta admit. It was a dick move to deny everyone food." Devil
          aimed the jab at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was hoping you guys would settle for the orgy option. All the food
          we need."
        </p>
        <p>"Get the fuck out." Devil laughed.</p>
        <p>I smiled from my position behind the counter.</p>
        <p>We're okay.</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>We're more than okay, better than before we even had the fight.</p>
        <p>I knew in my heart that we'll always be okay.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze traveled to Upper's direction to find him bickering with Milk
          over a tray choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hoped this new development was enough reason for him to want to
          stay. <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>FROM WHAT </b>I wore to how I talked and walked; over to the first
          time I had sex and tasted alcohol; and down to my first cigar, my
          father had been the dictator.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't mind. He knew what was best for me. He was my father.</p>
        <p>
          I was his shadow. His merciless soldier. His machine. I was to follow
          in his footsteps. Never make mistakes. Remember his advice and
          implement them.
        </p>
        <p>That was me—364 days of my life.</p>
        <p>
          The day of my birth had always been excluded. It was the only day I
          got to be me, twenty-four privileged hours where I got to live outside
          of myself. Rearrange my thoughts and my previous experiences if I
          can...but.
        </p>
        <p>That all changed on my 19th birthday.</p>
        <p>
          My father had forgotten, which meant I ought to have forgotten too.
          But December 1st had permanently been etched into my memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing I did that day was to visit the church in our
          compound. I was undeserving of it, but I still knelt and prayed for
          the salvation of my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, I left the premises, but unlike the other times, I didn't
          feel lighter; I felt...heavier. Pushing down the feeling, I went to
          get food and drinks for Elia. He had no idea it was my birthday; I
          never once told him; he just knew I stayed longer on this particular
          day. But unlike the last time, I didn't join him to eat; I just
          watched. When he asked why, I told him I had no appetite.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was ten and old enough to pick out my lie, but he didn't ask any
          further questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I left, I went to a private bar, got myself a beer, sat at a lone
          booth, and drank on an empty stomach.
        </p>
        <p>It was the first birthday I celebrated with...sadness.</p>
        <p>
          It was a sadness I saw no reason for, but I knew that it came with an
          odd sense of dread, with the subject matter being the fact that I was
          about to take on another year of being <i>Elio Marino</i>. Of living
          in this skin, in this time, in this face, of talking in this voice,
          wearing these clothes...another circle of ups and downs, of yes sirs
          and turning blind eyes, another round of living a lie that was my
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was about to do it all over again, and the feeling was
          downright...draining.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bar was dim-lit, and the music was tamped down to a low volume. I
          was on my fourth bottle of beer, my hand on my chin, my eyes a little
          drowsy, but my ears were sharp, telling me I was still too sober to be
          drunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the very back of my mind, a distant thought hunted me. For the past
          four years, precisely the day after I had killed for the first time,
          with the victim being a six-year-old boy. I had been noticing
          symptoms. Very close to what it had been like for my Mother; even
          before then, it was there, but not as intensely as it gripped me after
          I killed that kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was slowly becoming a shell of myself. But I hid it well; I willed
          for it to leave, for me to sleep better, for the dark thoughts to let
          me be...but the more I killed, the more I fell deeper and deeper into
          that shell, the more my mind failed me, breaking piece by piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least I'd always had December 1st to pull me back out of the shell.
          My dark thoughts had now tainted my one day of freedom, and I knew
          there was no coming back from this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I knew my 19th birthday would mark the day when I felt the
            heaviest, knowing there was nothing to celebrate. I could only mourn
            the next year to come. I could only hate the thought of taking in my
            first breath when I woke up the following day.

        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head off the thoughts, taking another swig of the beer the
          moment a blonde haired slid into my booth right opposite me.
        </p>
        <p>"Hi," she said with a dashing grin.</p>
        <p>I didn't respond.</p>
        <p>"Never seen you around here before...I'm Rosa. You are?"</p>
        <p>I remained quiet, just watching her.</p>
        <p>
          Her hair was dark at its root, but the blonde waves were long and
          shiny. I was impressed by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not much of a talker, are we." She still maintained her grin,
          mirroring my actions by putting her hand on her chin, her gaze falling
          to my fingers, which drummed softly on the table. "You got pretty
          fingers."
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped drumming, balling my fingers into a fist before drawing my
          hand from the table to tap on my knee instead.
        </p>
        <p>"Come on," she smiled. "Indulge me, don't be rude."</p>
        <p>"You're a disturbance," I spoke. "I need my quiet."</p>
        <p>
          That didn't seem to deter her; in fact, her cheeks turned pink.
          "No...I think you need a relief. I've been watching you. You
          look—lonely; I can change that."
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you, but no."</p>
        <p>
          "Give me a chance." She leaned closer, airing her cleavage on display.
          It didn't entice me; the swell of her breast just seemed like skin to
          me, nothing else. "I can be a good distraction."
        </p>

          <i
            >17 was the last time I think I had sex. Last and first. I was at
            one of my father's clubs. He had been celebrating a successful
            shipment. A huge one that involved 75% of his capos. They were so
            rowdy, and I was not too fond of the crowd, but I endured as they
            talked in slurs.

        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at this girl opposite me, I felt no attraction towards her.
          But then my gaze flickered back to her hair, how beautiful and
          effortless she made it look, how my fingers itched to feel the texture
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I said, slipping my hand into my pocket to pull out my phone,
          checking to see if there was a text message from Casmiro or my father.
          There was none, so I just pocketed it back.
        </p>
        <p>
          About an hour later, I fell beside Rosa on her bed, a sweaty and
          panting mess; my eyes locked on the ceiling as she chuckled beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My God," she breathed out. "That was so fucking good, and I don't
          even know your name." 
        </p>
        <p>I turned my head to catch her gaze but didn't say a word.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, nice to meet you, hot stranger." She said, shifting closer to
          me, the swell of her breast pressing against my arm, soft, warm, and
          naked, as she raised her hand to my chest, tracing circles with her
          fingers. "You're the best I've ever had..."
        </p>
        <p>I schooled my breathing.</p>
        <p>
          She kissed my arm, a smile curving at her lips. "You really don't talk
          much, huh."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't respond. I just looked away from her, my tongue brushing
          against my bottom lip as my breathing settled, and silence followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you have a girlfriend?" she asked softly. "If you don't or do, it
          doesn't matter; you can take my number, we can do this aga—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you usually this careless, Rosa?" I asked her, and I felt her
          stiffen beside me.
        </p>
        <p>Her circular movement on my chest seized. "What...do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "Bringing a stranger to your home, fucking him without even knowing
          his name? That's risky, Rosa. What if I decide to kill you?"
        </p>
        <p>"Why would you just—decide to kill me?"</p>
        <p>
          I turned my head towards her again, spotting the fear in her eyes. "I
          might be a killer. I could wrap my hands around your neck now and
          strangle you till I feel your life slip out of you, and no one would
          even know it was me. I could pull you by your hair to your kitchen,
          stab you with a knife until you're dead and bleeding from all corners
          of your stomach, and no one would know."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze went to her neck. "I could even slit your throat right here
          and now with one of my rings, and you'd bleed out on your mattress,
          eyes open in death, skin cold, pale, and empty of a soul," my gaze
          flickered back to hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt her heartbeat quicken from the press of her chest to my arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You need to be more careful, Rosa." Raw fear grew heavy in her eyes
          as I added. "Death can only take a few seconds," I informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She shifted away from me slowly. My eyes followed her movement, not
          once breaking away from her.
        </p>
        <p>Rosa gulped down. "Can you—can you leave?"</p>
        <p>
          I blinked at her, staring blankly. "Sure." I got out of the bed and
          began to redress.
        </p>
        <p>From my periphery, I caught Rosa dragging the duvet to her chest.</p>
        <p>
          When I finished putting on my clothes and shoes, I looked back at her,
          and she sunk further into the bed like she wanted to disappear. Her
          breathing was loud and panicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood upright again, tilting my head as I watched. "Do you still
          want my number, Rosa?"
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head. "Please just go."</p>
        <p>I nodded. "Thank you. I had a good time. Take care."</p>
        <p>
          I left her apartment, not before grabbing a can of beer from her
          fridge for the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching the compound, my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I fished for
          it, seeing Marianna's name on the screen with a text message that
          jolted my stomach.
        </p>
        <p><b>'SOS'</b></p>
        <p>
          I rushed into the house. The sound of glass shattering, coupled with
          screaming and crying, had me running toward my mother's room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I skidded down the hallway, my heart in my throat as I spotted
          Marianna holding a crying Lorenzo in her arms, right in front of my
          mother's room. Marianna was crying too, and I caught the sight of
          blood on Lorenzo's arm; the 7-year-old had his head buried in my
          sister's chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marianna looked up, her eyes burning with anger upon seeing me. "Where
          were you!" she screamed at me. "She fucking hurt him!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard loud mumblings, glass shattering, thuds, and incoherent
          screams from the closed door.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed the lump in my throat. "Go—get up, go stitch him up; I'll
          be with you both soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          She shot me a confused look, grey eyes blinking as if she hadn't heard
          me right. She got to her feet, and Lorenzo refused to look up. He
          never did. Never looked at me. I was on papà's side, not theirs. Never
          theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Soon? You want to go in there? She's mad, Marino! She's gone mad! She
          hurt Enzo!"
        </p>
        <p>"Please, Marianna, go to your room, lock your door—"</p>
        <p>"What if she hurt you? Mamma has gone mad!"</p>
        <p>
          "No, don't say that, she's just—she's fine, she's just going through
          something."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not a fucking child, Marino! She's fucking crazy!"</p>
        <p>"Maria, please, take Enzo away; I'll handle it."</p>
        <p>"But she's—"</p>
        <p>"Enzo will bleed out; go help him stitch his wound—"</p>
        <p>"What if she—"</p>
        <p>
          "Fucking go! Go to your damn room and lock the fucking door,
          Marianna!" I bellowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She flinched; fear clouded her eyes, a look I'd seen her wear whenever
          father was around; Enzo's crying grew louder, and he hugged Marianna
          tighter.
        </p>
        <p>I calmed, reaching for them. "Mari—"</p>
        <p>
          She flinched back in haste. "I hate you!" she yelled shakily, pulling
          Enzo away with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched them disappear down the hallway, biting my tongue and
          silently cursing myself for losing control like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, pulling off my shoe and socks, knowing mamá didn't like it
          when you entered her room with those.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed open the door, my heart melting the moment I spotted my
          mother pacing back and forth in haste, biting her fingers as she
          mumbled; tears were streaming down her face, her feet were bare, and
          she left blood stains on the ground as she stepped on the glass
          shatters, almost like she didn't feel the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mamá," I whispered as I entered the room. I didn't care about the
          pain that bit at my foot as I rushed towards her; I didn't care that I
          was cutting myself; I just knew I had to get to her, to bring her back
          here. To me. To reality. "Mamá," I called louder this time, stopping
          before her as she tried to step past me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blocked her path, and she moved to my other side, which I blocked
          again; her eyes were unseeing.
        </p>
        <p>"Mamá, look at me." I tried to catch her gaze.</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, trying to sidestep me again, but I blocked her
          path, and then she screamed. Her hands threw slaps and blows at me.
        </p>
        <p>"Get out! Get out, you bastard!"</p>
        <p>
          I tried to catch a hold of her hands as she screamed. "Mamá, it's me.
          It's Elio, look at me. See me!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No! Elio's dead! You killed my baby; you drowned my only child, you
          bastard! Get out! Get out of my life! Leave me alone!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. Mamá, I'm okay! I'm alive, Elio's here, I'm here!" I caught her
          hands, and she tried kicking me. "Mamá, please, stop—" her head drove
          right into my jaw, and I tasted blood on my lip, but I still tried to
          subdue her.
        </p>
        <p>"Leave me now!"</p>
        <p>"No, look at me! I'm here now! I'm here—"</p>
        <p>
          She fought me. I didn't want to hurt her; she was so fragile that I
          feared I'd bruise her wrist if I tightened my grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loosened my grip, letting her go because I knew she would turn to
          find the nearest object to hurl at me, and when she did turn, I
          wrapped my arms around her from behind, holding her tight, locking her
          back to my chest.
        </p>
        <p>"No!" A scream tore out of her. "Let me go, Ricardo!"</p>
        <p>
          "Mamá, it's Elio; try to listen to my voice, please!" The desperation
          in my voice rumbled from my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck off! I will murder you, you son of a bitch! I will fucking kill
          you for killing my baby!" As she screamed, she forcefully tried to
          squirm her way away from my hold, but I held firm, even though my head
          was a bit foggy from the alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>
          We both staggered on our feet, and I must have stepped on something
          because I was falling straight to the ground, still holding her.
        </p>
        <p>
          To shield her head from hitting the bedpost, I swirled us around and
          took her position. My elbow landed on a shard of glass, and the back
          of my head connected forcefully with the iron pole.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw fucking stars for about two minutes, but I still held her firm,
          even as she kicked her feet, jabbing her elbows into my stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweating with the effort I exercised trying to keep her steady. I
          tightened my hold around her, her back pressed to my chest as I locked
          her legs with mine, seizing her movements.
        </p>
        <p>"Please let me go! Don't hurt me!" she cried out in panic.</p>
        <p>
          "I will never hurt you," I told her calmly, feeling warm liquid slide
          down the back of my neck; I knew it was blood. The sharp pain at the
          back of my head was almost blinding. "Never, mamá."
        </p>
        <p>"Then let me go, Ricardo."</p>
        <p>
          "It's Elio. I'm Elio. Por favor, come back to me." I rocked her back
          and forth gently. "Por favor," I whispered.
        </p>
        <p>My grip tightened.</p>
        <p>"You killed him. You killed my only child."</p>
        <p>
          I clenched my jaw. "Mamá, you're scaring me. I'm here, goddamn it."
        </p>
        <p>"You killed my Elio."</p>
        <p>
          I dropped my head to the crook of her neck from behind. "I'm alive,
          Mamá. I'm okay. Listen to my voice."
        </p>
        <p>She calmed as she mumbled. "He's dead."</p>
        <p>
          "No, he's very much alive. He's holding you. You gave birth to him on
          this day, 19 years ago; you said he smiled at you even if he couldn't
          see you; you said he refused to let go of your hand. You said you sang
          him a lullaby in Spanish every night. You said he was priceless."
        </p>
        <p>"Priceless." She whispered.</p>
        <p>"Yes." I held her tighter, kissing her hair. "I'm here."</p>
        <p>
          "Here." It was barely above a whisper, and I knew she was passing out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm never leaving you. Ever." I rocked her back and forth, looking
          around at the mess in the room, knowing it would freak her out when
          she woke up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stayed that way for five minutes more before laying her on the bed
          and cleaning proceeding to clean the room. When I was done, I went to
          her bathroom to grab a kit before cleaning her wounds and tucking her
          in.
        </p>
        <p>I watched her for a few seconds and then exited the room.</p>
        <p>
          I forgot my shoe, bruises, or comportment as I charged down hallways,
          aiming for my father's study.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't bother knocking; I just badged in; the fury swirling in my
          veins was fucking blinding. My chest heaved as I watched the two men
          sitting opposite him stare up at me with a frown while my father
          looked at me with disappointment.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio, what is this—"</p>
        <p>"Out!" I bellowed at both men seated.</p>
        <p>They looked baffled, and my father gasped.</p>
        <p>
          When no one moved, I snared. "If you make me repeat myself, I will
          make sure the both of you regret ever fucking leaving your homes. Try
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          A second passed before they hastily got to their feet, and from the
          pinned castle emblem on their suits, I could tell they were one of my
          father's high-prioritized capos, and I still didn't fucking care.
        </p>
        <p>When they left, my father shot up from his seat.</p>
        <p>"You do not disrespect—"</p>
        <p>"Quiet!"</p>
        <p>
          His mouth clamped shut; surprise and caution bathed his eyes wide.
        </p>
        <p>"My mother's sick. You will not turn a blind eye to it anymore."</p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>"It was not a fucking request, father."</p>
        <p>
          I was riding on adrenaline. I couldn't—on an average day, speak to
          this man like this. But I was done keeping quiet.
        </p>
        <p>"She's getting worse," I said.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't matter." He said in Italian.</p>
        <p>
          I gawked. "She hurt Enzo. She hurt me! Don't you fucking see it!" I
          responded in English because I realized he was trying to take control.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your mother is fine! And you will cease to speak to me this way,
          boy!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked to him, got in his face, gripped his shirt collar, and
          yelled. "My mother needs help! She needs help, you bastard! Help! It
          can only get worse! What if she hurts herself? Hm? What do we do then?
          What the fuck do we do? She dies, then what, hm? Speak, you fucking
          bastard!"
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes searched mine. Twitching. "You sound more like her than
          yourself."
        </p>
        <p>"What—"</p>
        <p>
          "Are you sure you're feeling all right, son?" He asked in the dialect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused, realizing how my breathing came in short gasps, my gaze
          flickered to my tight grip on his shirt, and I instantly let him go,
          stepping back.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm fine."</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No. No. I am not taking any chances. Get some
          shoes, boy; we're getting a diagnosis."
        </p>
        <p>Fear clamped my gut. "I said I'm fine!"</p>
        <p>He shot me a glare. "Do you want me to use force? I will."</p>
        <p>
          There was no countering that, and in a few minutes, we were on our way
          to the family hospital.
        </p>
        <p>"If we can get Mamá—"</p>
        <p>"No talks about your mother." He snapped.</p>
        <p>
          We arrived at the hospital, and the process started; questions were
          asked. For some reason, brain scans were taken, and in about an
          hour...the result came. I was diagnosed with clinical depression,
          alongside some other brain things I'd blocked out because I felt my
          father froze up, and his eyes had darkened in the way they did when he
          was looking for quick solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, we were driving back home; the car was silent
          until he spoke.
        </p>
        <p>"You're joining the army." He announced.</p>
        <p>My head snapped to him. "What?"</p>
        <p>"You're joining the fucking army."</p>
        <p>"Why?" I asked, baffled.</p>
        <p>
          He was wise enough to pull over to the side of the road but left the
          engine on as he responded. "Didn't you hear the diagnosis? You're
          crazy, and I'll ensure I work it out of you."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not crazy."</p>
        <p>"You are."</p>
        <p>"I'm not fucking crazy!"</p>
        <p>
          "You are!" he yelled back. The vein on his forehead was visible. "Look
          at you! A fucking disappointment, Despicable and weak like your
          fucking mother."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head. "I'm not weak." I gritted out.</p>
        <p>"Oh, you are—"</p>
        <p>"You don't know what you're saying."</p>
        <p>"I know exactly—"</p>
        <p>
          "No!" I shook my head, glaring at him with disbelief, my heart
          hammering. "No, I carry this fucking family on my back while you fuck
          and cheat your way through Italy. I am there for <i>your </i>wife and
          <i>your </i>children; I'm there for you! I'm there for fucking
          everyone but myself! Why the fuck wouldn't I be depressed!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me like I was a stranger. "This. This right here, this
          despicable behavior, is why you need to get your head rearranged."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't need anything—"</p>
        <p>
          "If I say you need something, then you fucking need it! Do not counter
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're the one who's crazy! If you send me away, who's gonna look
          after them? Who's gonna hold Mamá when she forgets who she is again or
          what year this is? You can't do that to them, to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are joining the army, and you are getting your head on straight."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, looking ahead, my breathing ragged as I said. "How
          can you not see that you're ruining my life."
        </p>
        <p>"I am making you better."</p>
        <p>
          Looking back at him, I ignored the anger in his eyes and focused on
          his ignorance and fear. "No, papà, you're making me worse."
        </p>
        <p>
          That seemed to shut him up. He cleared his throat. "I am your father.
          You are to listen to me, do all I say; I know what's best for you.
          Leave the family to me; that is not your job. Getting better is your
          job. You will take my place someday, and I won't have you ruin my
          name, Elio. You are Marino. No Marino is a sick fuck. The army will
          remind you of that. Am I clear?"
        </p>
        <p>I rested my back on the leather seat, clenching my jaw hard.</p>
        <p>"Am I fucking clear, boy."</p>
        <p>"Yes sir."</p>
        <p>
          "Good." And then he started driving again. "You leave the day after
          tomorrow."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked out the window, thinking of the promises I was about to
          break.
        </p>
        <p>I did it all mechanically.<br /></p>
        <p>
          We reached home, and I was out of the car before he could call me
          back. I went straight to Marianna's room, unlocking the door with my
          master key.
        </p>
        <p>
          She and Enzo were on her bed, fast asleep. A book rested on her chest,
          almost slipping off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked in, took the book from her body, dropped it beside her, and
          turned off the reading lamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised the duvet, covering them before leaning down to kiss both
          their foreheads. "I'm sorry," I whispered. "I'm so sorry."
        </p>
        <p>
          I left the room and didn't sleep that night. When morning slowly
          crawled in, I went to Elia. Told him I was sending him away. He broke
          my fucking heart, cried, and begged that I shouldn't separate us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't tell him the reason. It was better if he hated me. Knowing my
          father had other plans for me in that army, I wouldn't be able to
          reach out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was going to be cut off. I was going to be tortured. This was his
          play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia held me tight and made me promise I wouldn't leave. I knew he
          wouldn't drop it; I'd been prepared for that. That was why I suddenly
          remembered a drink I had gotten for him on my way here; it was why I
          walked to my car, brought out the chilled juice box, walked back into
          the safe house, and watched him drink while he told me what his home
          school teacher had said about whales.
        </p>
        <p>It was why I watched him fall asleep suddenly.</p>
        <p>
          I drove him to the airport and handed him to the people who would take
          him to Los Angeles. It was why I stood there till the plane took off
          and disappeared from view.
        </p>
        <p>
          I crouched down, covered my face with my palms, and let out a guttural
          yell that made my chest ache throughout my drive home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made sure I didn't see Marianna, Lorenzo, or my mother that day.
        </p>
        <p>The next day, I was on my way to the army.</p>
        <p>The whole process was a blur in my head.</p>
        <p>They shaved my hair into a buzzcut.</p>
        <p>Gave me the uniform.</p>
        <p>
          And throughout my stay there, I had very special training asides from
          the general one.
        </p>
        <p>
          A year later, my father came to take me home. He was impressed by my
          progress. He gave me a hug which I didn't return. I didn't even look
          him in the eye once. The horrors I'd gone through, the things they'd
          done to me, the dark thoughts multiplying in my head with every second
          that passed.
        </p>
        <p>The numbness playing in my gut.</p>
        <p>I had been right. He had made me worse.</p>
        <p>
          But I knew my lever was back home. Back at the compound, my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were the only reason I was even remotely eager to return to that
          compound.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father had taken me straight to the meeting house, we were there
          for about three hours before I was free, and I raced to my room to
          change out of the uniform my father had forced me to wear to the
          meeting with his soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the moment I walked out of the room, and the building, all I saw
          was chaos, soldiers running helter-skelter—barking orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Water...hurry up...they're inside....fire....church...
            burning...stop the fire...quick!"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>The voices filtered in and out of my head.</p>
        <p>
          I will never forget the rage of the massive smoke erupting from that
          building, the smell of burning wood, and the heat of the fire fanning
          me from where I stood. I will never forget how my heart dropped to the
          bottom of my stomach when I realized what was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fire that had wiped out my mother and my siblings. The fire my
          mother had started. She had tied up my siblings, bathed them in
          petrol, and ignored their screams while she bathed herself and the
          church.
        </p>
        <p>With one flick of a lighter, they were gone. Burnt alive.</p>
        <p>And I was too late.</p>
        <p>I wasn't here.</p>
        <p>I wasn't present.</p>
        <p>
          I watched the footage from the church multiple times right after my
          father had killed everyone who had witnessed or seen what had really
          happened so that he could create a narrative in his favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched and watched repeatedly, letting every single detail of that
          video sew itself into my head.
        </p>
        <p>Because I would need it.</p>
        <p>
          I would need it for when I burn it all down, with my father and me as
          the very victims of our own demise. <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>I HAVEN'T </b>used the phone.</p>
        <p>
          It had been three weeks since Angelo got it, and it remained sealed
          inside the folding carton. I was still staring at it on my table like
          I was internally confronting the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          It proved onerous to elucidate why I couldn't open or activate the
          device. Probably because it had been 14 years since I last used one,
          and a lot had changed within that time. I mostly didn't have the zeal
          to own one or set it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was no illiterate to technological devices, but I wouldn't deny that
          it would sting to ask a smug Angelo or Casmiro for help in
          understanding how exactly the item worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I knew I would have to break that barrier sooner or later. Aside
          from sending Gemma a text message, the device was necessary.
        </p>
        <p>It could have been beneficial during the times when Zah—</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head off my train of thought, picked the box from the
          table, and tucked it safely inside one of my drawers.
        </p>
        <p>Work. Yes, focus on work.</p>
        <p>
          I ignored the emails and went straight to the folders I'd gotten from
          the governor of Turin; thanks to Pablo's over-trusting personality and
          his love for loyalty, Marino had gained control over the state affairs
          in Turin, and with that came a lot of brain work that I'd been putting
          off due to another project for Milan. I didn't want to confuse both,
          but I was lagging, losing focus on... essential things.
        </p>
        <p>It was careless.</p>
        <p>I <i>can't</i> be careless.</p>
        <p>
          It had been three weeks since that board room meeting, three weeks
          since I'd last seen STREET, though Angelo ensured I received feedback
          from their work progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new painting had been released, and they had traveled to Tunisia to
          fetch it. According to the report, some other group had beaten them to
          it, but it was later confirmed that the painting was also a fake.
        </p>
        <p>I wasn't surprised.</p>
        <p>
          There was obviously more to it. We were missing something, and my
          little artist was the key to finding that thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except, according to my people in charge of getting the answers out of
          him, he wasn't letting up.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was when I succumbed to taking matters into my own hands, but I
          had been hesitating. If I interfered, someone would die...and I didn't
          have time to see through a wipeout, so I put the artist's fate in the
          hands of professionals who could torture the truth out of him.
        </p>
        <p>That way, nobody dies. And I still get my answer.</p>
        <p>
          I should also probably stop STREET from wasting their time searching
          for the fakes. But what good would that do me?
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to keep them busy, away from me. I needed to focus.</p>
        <p>I needed <i>her</i> away from me.</p>
        <p>From my space.</p>
        <p>
          I couldn't afford the distracting feelings that came with my thoughts
          trailing to her—damn it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flipped a page open in the folder, my eyes perusing through the
          words as I read—correction; I <i>tried</i> to read, to understand the
          words, and I did understand them, but they made absolutely no sense.
        </p>
        <p>Three weeks.</p>
        <p>
          Three weeks of me trying so hard to school my thoughts, to block out
          the voice of the witch, to erase the strange feeling of
          unsatisfaction, and the nonsensical craving I had to hear her speak to
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          To have her ask me questions that would require me to <i>talk</i> to
          her. To have a conversation where she threw out sarcastic jokes, and I
          pretended to hate them.
        </p>
        <p><i>Fucking pathetic. </i></p>
        <p>
          The woman probably doesn't remember you exist, and if she does
          remember, what then? She had made her standing clear. And even if she
          hadn't, even if by an opportune chance she had actually wanted to talk
          about it, what would happen afterward? Do we explore? I ask her to
          enter into a relationship with me? I fuck her? —
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >That is a very nefarious thought, Elio. She is with your brother,
            for God's sake.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I was getting ahead of myself here. Why would I think of a
          relationship with someone I still fantasize about killing?
        </p>
        <p><i>What is wrong with you, Elio?</i></p>
        <p>I don't like this.</p>
        <p>
          This fucking distraction—I banged the folder on the table, the blow
          from my fist causing a rattle as I shot to my feet, walking around the
          desk while rubbing my brows and pacing back and forth in the study.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Focus, Focus." I chanted. "These are all useless thoughts, not
          beneficial; it's not aiding your goals, it's not important, it's
          rubbish...she's rubbish, she's nothing, she's a woman, she's just an
          element made up of skin, bones and a soul, she's only matter, a
          substance put together with numerous particles that occupy space.
          Nothing more, she's—"
        </p>
        <p>"E, are you fr—"</p>
        <p>
          I stopped, my head turned toward the door to see that it was opened
          slightly with Casmiro peeking in, brows drawn down in a frown.
        </p>
        <p>"Were you talking to yourself?" He blatantly asked.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>I shoved both my hands into my pocket, watching him.</p>
        <p>
          Slowly, he walked into the study, eyes going around the space like he
          was trying to seek out whom I was talking to; when he couldn't find
          anyone, he looked back at me with a frown, and I kept my expression
          blank.
        </p>
        <p>"I heard you mumbling something."</p>
        <p>"You heard nothing."</p>
        <p>"I heard something—"</p>
        <p>
          "What is the reason for your visit? State it and leave. I am busy."
        </p>
        <p>"Talking to yourself?"</p>
        <p>"State it. And leave."</p>
        <p>He sighed, dropping it. "It's about your artist."</p>
        <p>That caught my attention. "Did he speak?"</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shook his head. "No, I'm beginning to think he's never going
          to. We need you down there; maybe your presence would change
          something."
        </p>
        <p>
          I locked my jaw. "Are you telling me that my professional team is
          incapable of torturing answers out of a simple artist?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "They've tried all the methods; the man is half dead as we speak. His
          fingers have been chopped off; I'm guessing his inability to work has
          made him incompliant."
        </p>
        <p>"Ah...I see. Poor thing." </p>
        <p>
          "It has been three weeks, he's wasting our time, and STREET hasn't
          gotten any new leads for the next painting yet."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm. How unfortunate."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro glared at me, standing straighter. "Be serious, E. If we go on
          like this, the artist would be dead before we rope out any answers
          from him."
        </p>
        <p>"You want me to speak to him."</p>
        <p>"Yes. He will talk when you...do your thing."</p>
        <p>"My thing?"</p>
        <p>"You know...the wicked thing that works for people."</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to laugh, but my expression remained blank as I said. "There
          is no such thing as <i>the wicked thing</i>, and that's too many
          <i>'things'</i> in a sentence."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know we also need to be ahead of this th—search for the painting.
          So, show your face once, so he knows we mean business."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sure he knows we mean business. The team chopped off his fingers.
          Cruel. Impressive. But I have work to do. We should be traveling to
          Turin in a few days for the appointment dinner—"
        </p>
        <p>"We still have time for that. This is important."</p>
        <p>
          I suppressed the urge to groan, doing away with my unseriousness. "I
          know it is important." I stopped to think, my brain issuing me ugly
          ideas. "He should be taken to the hot room. Open his wounds, and leave
          him there for an hour; I'll visit him afterward."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay." He moved towards the door, eying me... "I can leave you alone,
          right?"
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          He stood there, staring at me like he needed another confirmation.
          When the silence dragged on, I sighed, motioning to the door.
        </p>
        <p>"Get the fuck out, Casmiro."</p>
        <p>"Right." He cleared his throat. "See you in an hour."</p>
        <p>And then he was gone.</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, returning to my desk drawer to take out the phone
          box. Without a second thought, I opened it, turned it on, and spent
          the next few minutes setting it up. Some things took a few minutes for
          me to get used to, but as I said, I wasn't illiterate when it came to
          technology, so I quickly mastered it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saved Angelo's number, followed by Casmiro and Gemma's, before
          clicking on the messaging icon next to her name.
        </p>
        <p>The page switched to a blank message space.</p>
        <p>
          I hesitated, knowing it had been almost a month since she had given me
          her number. I didn't want to give the wrong impression by proceeding
          to use the number, but she had been kind to me, oblivious of my
          world—at least with what I assumed, she didn't care if I was covered
          in blood. It was strange.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was inquisitive; it took quite a lot for another human to have
          me <i>curious</i>. It was effortless with Zahra because I became a
          completely different person when it came to her. But with Gemma, I
          simply wondered why she had chosen to ignore my bad and focus on the
          good she could see, the good I seemed to have. 
        </p>
        <p>Why haven't I forgotten our encounter? What is there?</p>
        <p>Why does my gut approve? It was indeed strange.</p>
        <p>
          I am not one to ignore something my mind refuses to forget, and my gut
          feeling never had once led me astray, so...
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b></p>
        <p><b>Hello.</b></p>
        <p><i>Delivered</i></p>
        <p>
          I stared at the phone screen, wondering briefly if she would respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had gotten a text like this, I would probably ignore it. If I get
          a text at all, I will ignore it. Besides, Angelo and Casmiro knew
          better than to send a text. Upon getting this phone, I informed them
          they could only call the number for significant emergencies.
          <i>Not</i> for emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>No texting.</p>
        <p>
          I probably should also get Elia's phone number for significant
          emergencies, but I knew that was impossible. I still needed a contact
          in STREET who would be a liable private informant. Maybe the one with
          the beverage name—the phone vibrated in my grip, and my mind drew back
          to it, seeing her response.
        </p>
        <p><b>Gemma(blonde car highway):</b></p>
        <p><b>Hi?</b></p>
        <p><b>Who is this?</b></p>
        <p>My fingers drummed on the table as I read the message.</p>
        <p>Why am I hesitating? I have no reason to hesitate.</p>
        <p>
          I admit that I subconsciously made sure I cleared things up with
          Zahra. In fact, I have had three weeks to...think...ah, of course.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed.</p>
        <p>The <i>reason</i> I have been stalling to activate the device.</p>
        <p>
          My mind was toying with me. It refused to let thoughts of that little
          witch go. This wasn't due to the sting of her words; I already found a
          solution to that.
        </p>
        <p>This was lust, pure carnal lust I had no way of getting rid of.</p>
        <p>
          I have never—no. I held my thoughts; I can't dwell on this. I
          shouldn't dwell on this because each time I allowed my mind to walk in
          that direction, I forgot the crucial detail being her involvement with
          my brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did say they weren't in a relationship. But they were involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The act on that rooftop weeks ago goes against every set rule I had in
          place for myself. It felt even worse knowing I had grown oddly fond of
          her in a way, a fondness that allowed the feeling of care to creep in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew what I was saying when I told her I liked talking to her. It
          had been the truth, and yes, my fantasy about slitting her throat open
          while she spoke had been the truth, too, even though I knew I would
          never go through with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes hated my inability to lie when it was unnecessary to tell
          the truth.
        </p>
        <p>My phone vibrated multiple times.</p>

          The bubble popped up immediately, but then it disappeared. It did that
          a couple of times before a response finally came.

          I was amused by the capital letters; I could hear her voice yelling

          The bubble disappeared and appeared several times, and then it

          I exited the messaging app, slipped the phone into my pocket, and left
          the study to the building where the hot room was located a reasonable
          distance from the house.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro, Angelo, alongside three other soldiers from my torture team,
          stood inside the room. I didn't acknowledge any of them as I entered.
          My attention was trained solely on the person I wanted to question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the heat had been turned off upon my arrival, I became one
          with the lingering hotness around me. I allowed it to communicate with
          my skin and my being.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I stepped forward, every man in the room, including Casmiro and
          Angelo, straightened while discreetly inching back from my form even
          though they were already standing a convenient distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The artist sat on a mid-back iron chair with his back bending in a way
          that made him look more uncomfortable; his hands were strapped to each
          arm of the chair. No fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smell of burning flesh lingered in the air, and I bottled my
          irritation, walking closer to the man who was breathing heavily, head
          cast downwards, clothes bloodied and dirty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I admired his strong will. Anyone would have killed him at this point,
          registering that he knew nothing and could give no useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I brought him here based on a gut feeling. He wasn't leaving until
          I got my answer.
        </p>
        <p>"Look up," I spoke into the stale air.</p>
        <p>
          His shoulders stopped moving. His breathing ceased for a second before
          it grew more frantic. His head snapped up, and red-rimmed brown eyes
          coated in fear stared at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Handling you is already inconvenient, and I wouldn't like to waste
          even more of my time because I have a conversation to finish in
          about," I brought my wrist to my view, "thirty minutes. So, I will ask
          the question, and you will answer me. Not with a lie. Not with a
          half-truth and not with a dismissal. If you do either of these three
          things, you will lose more than your fingers."
        </p>
        <p>
          His chapped lips pressed into a thin line, determination in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He was going to do either one of the options I listed.</p>
        <p>
          "What's his first name?" I asked no one in particular without taking
          my eyes off him.
        </p>
        <p>"Fio," Angelo answered.</p>
        <p>
          "Fio," I repeated, my eyes searching his. "It will be in your best
          interest to cooperate with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know nothing, and even if I do, and I do tell you, you will kill me
          either way. I know who you are."
        </p>
        <p>"It is good that you do. That's why you will not waste my time."</p>
        <p>
          "My response remains the same. Mr. Garza wanted me to paint the damn
          chihuahua, and I painted the damn chihuahua. The rest were printed
          fakes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yet, millions of US dollars went into your bank account after you
          painted the original."
        </p>
        <p>"It was valuable."</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "It was. I have spoken with Arturo Garza. And just like me,
          he's a strategic businessman. He wouldn't make you set for life with a
          huge amount of money for one original painting. Not when each painting
          has the same intricate stroke of a brush and the distinct smell of
          dried paint and...pine wood."
        </p>
        <p>He swallowed, panic working its way to his eyes as I continued.</p>
        <p>
          "You disappeared for months. Into a very convenient safe house a few
          states outside of Mexico; the said safe house was made out of the pine
          woods surrounding the area. Am I correct?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
        <p>
          "Strike one. dismissal." I announced, straightening. "The safe house I
          speak of was registered in Arturo's name. I believe that is where you
          decided to paint?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Fio let out a shaky breath. "Yes, Mr. Garza had given me that safe
          house. He didn't want me in the city while I worked on the original
          painting—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Strike two. Half-truth. You already painted the original. Arturo gave
          you that safe house so you could paint the duplicates of the original,
          am I correct?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He hesitated, shifting slightly on the chair as he shook his head.
          "No, you are not. The duplicates were printed."
        </p>
        <p>"Strike three. Lies."</p>
        <p>
          He swallowed. "I know fucking nothing, I swear to you. When Mr. Garza
          gave me that project, my life changed, and I—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will care about your life's achievement when pigs grow wings and
          litter the sky."
        </p>
        <p>He clamped his mouth shut.</p>
        <p>
          "I warned you about wasting my time. Apparently, you are one of those
          who get curious to see what I would do next. You might think since
          your fingers and source of lively hood is gone, there's nothing else
          we can take."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have no family you can hunt down. I have nothing. You might as well
          kill me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him for almost a minute, and he squirmed under my stare,
          discomfort staining his posture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought one hand from my pocket, rubbing my jaw as I looked away
          from the man to everyone else in the room, watching the scene with
          curiosity, also wondering what I would do next.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at the artist. "Last chance, Fio. I insist you tell me
          what you know about the original painting. What is the tell? What
          would make finding it easier?"
        </p>
        <p>"Like I said, I know nothing."</p>
        <p>The silence grew—one minute.</p>
        <p>Two.</p>
        <p>Three.</p>
        <p>Four...</p>
        <p>Well...I warned.</p>
        <p>
          I bent to his level; both my hands covered his wrists on the arm of
          the chair as I looked him dead in the eye. "Do you want to hear a
          story, Fio?"
        </p>
        <p>He swallowed, the sound spelling fear.</p>
        <p>
          "About an artist. He <i>was</i> an orphan, drew little sketches of
          people in the street of Paris, wore rags for clothes, but had a brown
          hat given to him by a respectable sailor after a wonderful sketch he
          made of him. The artist was so happy. He wore it daily; even when he
          went to sleep, he would hug it to his chest, his first achievement."
        </p>
        <p>Fio's eyes grew wide in terror.</p>
        <p>
          "That little hat seemed to have given him so much hope, and then he
          started sketching for coins. People would stop by in his open corner,
          dropping coins for a sketch, couples, families, tourists...He felt
          like he found a standing. It made him save up. He then bought
          watercolors and brushes and started adding colors to people's clothes
          in his drawings. He gave them smiles that reached their eyes, even
          when the smiles didn't."
        </p>
        <p>Fio lips parted, breathing noisily.</p>
        <p>
          "He made so much money, grew up, and traveled to Mexico. He got a
          part-time job at an antique store. He changed his name from Yves to
          Fio so that he could blend in. The owner of the antique store never
          paid him a dime, but the basement beneath the store was spacious and
          had an aesthetic feel; he <i>loved</i> painting there. Made a couple
          of thousand dollars through online ordering and delivering."
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head slowly, tears gathering in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Through that means, he met a beautiful woman, Sofia. She
          <i>was</i> also an artist, but she was more into digital art. They
          fell madly in love. She had red hair and the most dashing smile he had
          ever seen. They met physically on a sunny summer morning, and her
          beauty enchanted him; he couldn't stop smiling at her. She became his
          muse, and he painted a beautiful portrait of her, which caught the eye
          of many collectors. Eventually, they got married."
        </p>
        <p>"No," his voice trembled.</p>
        <p>"Oh yes, they did."</p>
        <p>"No, please," his breathing shuddered, and his tears dropped.</p>
        <p>
          "It was a small wedding. Only four attendees. But it was the most
          important day of their lives; they would finally live their dreams and
          grow old together as man and wife."
        </p>
        <p>"This can't be happening." Fio's pained voice forced out.</p>
        <p>
          "Fio got an amazing offer worth millions of dollars about a year
          later. It was so huge that he got a lovely wine to celebrate this good
          news. Sofia was his biggest supporter; together, they took a renewed
          honeymoon to a little wooden house outside Mexico."
        </p>
        <p>"Stop, please..."</p>
        <p>
          "The air was fresher, the smell of pine wood and raw earth, the sheer
          luxury of peace of freedom. It was the best time of Fio's life. After
          six months, he finished the job and returned, receiving extra money
          for his efficiency. Fio was indeed set for life."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will tell you all you need to know...just don't finish the story."
        </p>
        <p>I ignored him. "Years later, his wife gets pregnant."</p>
        <p>His shoulders shook in tears.</p>
        <p>
          "Unfortunately, she was only six months in when he got kidnapped."
        </p>
        <p>"Ask me any question; I'll give you your answer."</p>
        <p>
          "He was kept in the hands of terrible men, tortured every day, his
          fingers were chopped off, and he knows he'll probably never be able to
          hold a brush to paint ever again, so he decided to be stubborn. To
          take the truth to his grave."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus Christ, I beg of you. There's a tell, okay! There's a fucking
          tell in the original painting!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He tried to tell the truth when the bad guys told him a story of
          himself, but it was too late. He shouldn't have been stubborn. The bad
          guys didn't have time for a story, but he made them tell it anyway.
          So, they got very annoyed. Irritated...And they brought in his
          pregnant wife."
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of the door opening had him jolting. Soft whimpers and
          footsteps reached my ear, and I didn't have to look to see the
          red-haired, pregnant woman by the side, next to probably a stunned
          Casmiro and Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't care less about what they were thinking because my eyes
          were solely on Fio, whose body started to thrash at the sight of his
          blindfolded wife.
        </p>
        <p>My hand held firm on his wrist.</p>
        <p>"Sofia!" he yelled.</p>
        <p>A sob racked out of the woman. "F-Fio?"</p>
        <p>
          "When Fio caught sight of his crying wife, he yelled her name, so
          loud, so fierce the bad guys felt it right in their guts, and when
          sweet Sofia responded with a stutter, they wanted to feel pity, but
          then they remembered they had given Fio a chance to talk, and he
          didn't."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the love of God, she's pregnant; she has nothing to do with this.
          We have nothing to do with your search; I'm just an ordinary artist
          who got paid for a fucking job—please—please just let her go." he
          cried.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then Fio tried to bargain and make the bad guys see reason. To let
          his pregnant wife go, but no one said this was a romance story or a
          happily ever after...."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The-there's a little white stroke underneath the eye of the Chihuahua
          in every fake. It is absent in the original. Mr. Garza sent out 99 of
          those paintings after I had them delivered. The original—the original
          was only with me until I painted the first duplicate. I don't know,
          but I think he hid the original himself; he went on a trip outside of
          Mexico, I don't know where, but I bet that trip was to find a perfect
          spot to hide the original. Maybe at a family landmark, I have no
          fucking idea—but I swear—I swear this is all I know."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fio, in a state of panic, told the bad guys all he knew about the
          painting, and while the bad guys had gotten all they needed from him,
          they decided to let him go...." I let a pause ring through, and I
          could feel every breath in the room pause with my last statement. "But
          then, the bad guys thought, if we let him and his pregnant wife go,
          what would happen if someone else got to them?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, please," Fio choked out a cry at the same time Sofia let out a
          sob.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The bad guys took pity on pregnant Sofia and removed her blindfold so
          she could see her husband alive one last time." I didn't look to see
          if the blindfold had come off, but the gasp from Sofia and the loud
          crying that followed told me they had.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fio...amore...p-please, sir—don't hurt him; he hasn't done anything.
          He hasn't hurt anyone in his life—he hasn't caused any trouble; he's
          innocent, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sofia tried to beg the bad guys, tried to save her husband, but the
          bad guys knew it wouldn't be possible. If Fio could break so easily,
          someone else might do even worse, and he'd spill the truth to that
          someone else, and the bad guys couldn't have that, so they
          decided...."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned my gaze from Fio for the first time, looking at Angelo, whose
          eyes showed wary, and then Casmiro, who looked uncertain, but remained
          firm in support of every decision I'd make, no matter how cruel.
        </p>
        <p>I looked back at Fio, whose eyes remained pleadingly on me.</p>
        <p>
          "I beg you, do whatever you want with me, but please let her go,
          ple—please."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fio begged," I raised my hands from his wrists, placing them on both
          sides of his face. "His eyes, once hopeful for a bright future, his
          eyes which had shined in happiness after he received that hat on the
          street of Paris, now flowed with tears, knowing the very thing he
          loved the most was now the one thing that would put him under."
        </p>
        <p>Sofia's heart-wrenching cry met my ears.</p>
        <p>
          "It was so sad a scene. Too...emotional for the bad guys to spend even
          a second in the room, knowing how it would all end. They decided to
          snap the neck of Fio, and they probably should have asked Sofia to
          look away. Still, the bad guys were so bad that they derived pleasure
          from the scream the wife gave afterward...they knew they would derive
          even more pleasure when they bury her 6 feet under...alive with her
          husband." My eyes searched his as my grip tightened on both sides of
          his face. "A very tragic end to a beautiful story."
        </p>
        <p>The room went quiet.</p>
        <p>"Did you like my story, Fio?"</p>
        <p>"No, no...I want to hear more." He rushed out.</p>
        <p>
          I pressed my lips together, shaking my head. "Unfortunately...that was
          the end."
        </p>
        <p>"Please n—"</p>
        <p>
          I twisted his neck in a sickening snap that resounded around the room,
          a purge of blood freefalling from his nostrils.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wailing-like scream from his wife pierced the air, almost making
          me deaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          I withdrew my hand from his head, and it fell lifelessly at an odd
          angle.
        </p>
        <p>And like that. Fio died.</p>
        <p>
          I raised to my full height, turning to see Sofia holding her stomach
          as she cried, her face scrunched up in pain, her feet wobbly on the
          ground as her body shook, crying out her husband's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo brushed past, beelining for the door, looking like someone who
          wanted to throw up.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I looked at Casmiro, his jaw was clenched tight. His eyes weren't
          on me; they were on Fio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, they were on Fio. He just witnessed his life from start to
          finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could have just killed him. I didn't have to make anyone know him
          before I did. I didn't have to make them care...I didn't have to make
          Fio re-live his life and see his death before it happened.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't have to make his wife watch.</p>
        <p>But I did.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Because I am sick in the head.</p>
        <p>Because I'm The Wicked.</p>
        <p>Because I...I liked it.</p>
        <p>
          My hands shook. I balled them into a fist before releasing and shoving
          them into my pockets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cries from Sofia attached themselves to my brain, resounding in
          echoes.
        </p>
        <p>I stepped closer to her and ground my teeth as I said. "Shut up."</p>
        <p>She didn't seem to hear.</p>
        <p>
          "Shut. Up." I repeated, and she snapped upright, pressing her lips
          together to try and stifle her cry. Her body shook, tears streaming
          down her face as she held her stomach, body tight with withheld tears,
          eyes unable to meet mine.
        </p>
        <p>I turned to Casmiro.</p>
        <p>
          "See to it that she's taken care of," I stated, making him look up at
          me with guarded eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Taken care of..." something like hope lingered in his voice.</p>
        <p>"Six feet under. Alive with her husband."</p>
        <p>
          "No...por favor!" Sofia cried out, hand grasping my arm. "I don't care
          what you do to me, but let—please! Please let me have my baby first.
          She's innocent. Please, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze settled on her hand on my arm before I slowly looked back at
          her. "Get...your hands off me."
        </p>
        <p>
          She drew back in fear, almost stumbling, but Casmiro held her upright.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tears streamed down her face as she clapped her palms tightly under
          her chin in a praying posture. "Let her live, please; she doesn't—she
          doesn't know anything about the painting; she's not even born yet,
          sir." Her lips trembled. "When—when she's born—you can take me—kill
          me, butcher me, I don't—I don't care at all, but just—let her live,
          sir, please."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered to her stomach, then back to her tear-stricken face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dusted where she had touched me on my suit, straightening my
          composure as my gaze briefly flickered to Casmiro, whose eye wore what
          resembled a plea.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"...Grief is normal. You can't stop people from feeling it by
            killing them."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at the other soldiers in the room before looking back at
          Sofia.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"...You're stopping them from a future they could have had. A life.
            Maybe even better than the one we have."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I tried blocking out her voice.</p>
        <p>
          "If I let you have this baby, I will plant a bullet to its skull the
          minute it comes out of you. Coating you with its brain particles and
          then bury you alive with your dead husband and baby, do you want
          that?"
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head furiously, face tight with tears.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"...sometimes it's better to have a limit, so you don't completely
            lose yourself."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>I was suffocating.</p>
        <p>
          I tried to free the hold of the tie around my neck. "Then," my gaze
          flickered to Casmiro and back to her. "Take the easy way out, Sofia."
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes widened as she looked up at Casmiro, then at me.</p>
        <p>The air was suffocating me. <br /></p>
        <p>
          I looked away from the crying woman. "You know what to do, Cas." Then
          I turned and motioned for the other soldiers. "Clean up the mess."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, I was out of the room, taking a lung full of clear oxygen,
          but it wasn't enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Go back in there. Finish the job. </i>Another voice bashed into my
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brushed past men who cleared the way for me when they noticed my
          sudden movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >You're making a mistake, boy; she will come back for you. Finish
            the damn job.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>I chased the entrance like I chased death.</p>
        <p><i>Go back now, Marino, yo—</i></p>
        <p>I got out of the building, letting out a gasp of breath. </p>
        <p>
          Releasing my shaky hands from my pocket, I flexed my fingers, walking
          towards my house in the compound with a fast-thumping heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up when I rounded a corner and halted at the sight before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra was there, wearing a cooperate black dress, pacing back and
          forth, and glaring at the soldiers standing in front of my building.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did a double-take in my direction, almost doubling over in relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank fucking Jesus," she looked back at the guards. "please give me
          permission to kill these motherfuckers, I've been standing here for
          almost an hour, and I don't think STREET bought my
          <i>need-to-relax-head ache-story</i>," she looked back at me. "and I
          bet one of them is planning to burst into my room to find arranged
          pillows on the—" she stopped midway, her gaze searching my face as
          they slowly widened in concern, "What's wrong?" she advanced towards
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I met her halfway before she could reach me, taking her hand in
          mine. "You're coming with me," I said, pulling her towards the
          direction of my house, right past the guards and into my space.

          Thank you for your engagement in the last chapter! Love you guys so
          much!<br />

        <p>
          I heard a rumor that you guys spammed me with comments in this--that's
          not working (That was a line from THE UMBRELLA ACADEMY, a really sick
          TV show!) anyway, don't forget to comment as you read!

        <p>Enjoy this update!</p>
        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>FOR A </b>woman with a sharp mouth and a bold persona, her hand was
          small against mine, warm and soft, addicting to touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would think her palm, which I was certain had held a gun one too
          many times, would be calloused and rough, but it turned out to be the
          opposite, and I wanted to detach my hand; I wanted to sever that small
          connection, but I did the complete opposite; my grip tightened, and I
          led us towards the direction of my room without pause.
        </p>
        <p>
          What am I doing? Why am I doing this? What was the purpose of taking
          her with me? My mind could not phantom an answer; all I knew was that
          she had to undo whatever mutilation she had summoned into my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will you fucking slow down?" She gasped out, practically running
          after me. I didn't care.
        </p>
        <p>
          An infinitesimal part of my senses was actively trying very hard not
          to acknowledge the fact that she was in a dress that hugged her body
          like a second skin; curves I had once noticed were now accentuated to
          drive home my attraction towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled her past the passageway, down to the last room on the left. I
          didn't stay in the master bedroom located three doors down on the
          third floor; I stayed in the guest room on the ground floor. It was
          the smallest room in the whole building, meant for guests whom you
          didn't want venturing into the other floors of the building. But it
          was perfect for me.
        </p>
        <p>I'd never brought anyone here.</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro never came here; if he ever was in the house, his destination
          was my lounge area and study. Angelo, though, my ever-loving shadow,
          dropped by once in a while to check if I was still breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why I was letting Zahra cross this space when I still knew nothing
          about her was by far the careless thing I'd ever done. But then again,
          my reasoning became very difficult when it came to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm either too blinded by anger to see reason, too gone by curiosity
          to see what lay behind her eyes, too irked by irritation to see past
          her behavior, or too driven to comprehend the other things I had just
          mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>She caused this. She will solve it.</p>
        <p>
          I pushed open the door to the room, locked it behind me, and then let
          go of her hand before finally looking at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wide eyes shone with annoyance and somehow looked brighter than usual.
          I could tell it had something to do with the dark straight line across
          her eye—make-up, she was on make-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is the matter with you?" she asked, looking from me to peer
          around the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stay here, and don't move," I told her, making my way to the bathroom
          while I shrugged off my suit, hanging it carefully before I crossed
          through the bathroom door, closed it behind me, and headed straight
          for the sink.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands still shook when I opened the mirror compartment and picked
          up the small bronze bottle filled with pills. I uncapped it, filtered
          four atop my palm, and threw them into my mouth, swallowing dry.
        </p>
        <p>It was tasteless—or maybe I was just used to it.</p>
        <p>
          I covered the case, keeping it back and closing the hidden cupboard,
          coming face to face with my reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held both sides of the sink tight, eyes on my reflection as I began
          inhaling and exhaling—
        </p>
        <p>
          Sofia's scream pierced through my head suddenly. I winced in a flinch
          and pressed my eyelids together before pulling them wide apart, trying
          to blink my thoughts back in order as I shook my head sharply.
        </p>
        <p>I let her live.</p>
        <p>
          I shouldn't have. If my message through eye contact had been delivered
          to Casmiro the way I intended, he was looking for a way to ship the
          woman somewhere I wouldn't ever think to find her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfinished business. I fucking hated it. It made me feel incomplete.
          And I knew I would suffer for it; I knew the voice would triple in
          number.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my dictionary, there was no such thing as right or wrong. There had
          been once, but my life hadn't been fair, so why should I be fair? Why
          should I understand something no one had cared to understand when it
          came to me? Why should I do the right thing?
        </p>
        <p>What exactly <i>is</i> the right thing?</p>
        <p>
          Letting her suffer for the rest of her life, raising a baby alone
          without a father? Or ending her suffering before it even begins?
        </p>
        <p>Why does it seem like I have just made a colossal mistake?</p>
        <p>
          My breathing wasn't calming, I was getting angrier by the second, my
          mind was getting sharper, and the pills were doing absolutely nothing.
        </p>
        <p>Useless!</p>
        <p>
          Had Zahra's voice not entered my mind at that very moment—I would have
          moved on with my day—fuck, had Zahra not entered my life
          <i>at all</i>, I wouldn't remember what it felt like to be guilty, all
          these unwanted weak emotions and thoughts wouldn't be singing a
          fucking elegy in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't be a torment to my own self. My skin wouldn't feel like
          that of a stranger's.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't want to peel it off or get out of myself or my body. I
          wouldn't—
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand swung, knocking off all the items on the counter; they fell
          with sharp clashes and shattering. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Jitterily, I exited the bathroom, my gaze finding Zahra's wary ones
          from where she stood in front of a dressing table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips parted like she wanted to say something, but I was already
          walking towards her with a glare that I couldn't even hide or morph
          into indifference.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          Her words ceased when I caged her with my body, backing her against
          the dressing table with both hands on either side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I caught the sound of her breath hitching in her throat with a small
          gasp as she looked up at me, her lips parting while her eyes searched
          mine, "Whatever you think I've done—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fix this." I cut her off; my breathing was very loud due to how my
          skin sucked in the warmth from her body.
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked, her brows dropping in genuine confusion. "What are you
          talking about? Fix—fix what?" I hated and loved the concern in her
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fix this!" my voice shook in withheld anger, and then I said between
          my teeth, "Fix me."
        </p>
        <p>Her chest heaved, and her frown deepened. "I don't—"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't fucking feign innocence right now, Zahra. You know what you
          did."
        </p>
        <p>"What did I do?"</p>
        <p>
          I drew in a shaky breath, leaning away from her, from the fucking
          sweet smell of her hair and skin, from the familiar tightness in my
          chest that grew from the fondness of seeing her face and hearing her
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brushed my hair back with a sharp painful tug as I looked away from
          her.
        </p>
        <p>"You have ruined my mind."</p>
        <p>"What—"</p>
        <p>
          "Three weeks, Zahra." I looked back at her. "I have not been myself
          for three weeks, and I don't understand why because, believe it or
          not, I truly <i>really</i> want to see you dead; I don't like you,
          Zahra, I don't like you as a person, you have all the qualities that I
          despise in a woman and a person, you have qualities that mirror who I
          am, and I don't want to be near it, I don't want to want it, but—you
          did something to me. Somewhere between that car chase and now, you did
          something to me; I know it."
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't do anything to you; what are you talking about?"</p>
        <p>
          "You are messing with my head!" I yelled. "I can't—I can't focus on
          anything; I can't think properly because all I fucking see, think, and
          breathe is the thought of you for no goddamn reason, so fucking fix
          it!"
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "I am spiraling, Zahra. For the first time in my life, I am
          questioning my actions, I am seeking morals I have never once cared
          for, and it's all because of you. I might have just made a mistake
          because of your voice in my head, so take it away. Now."
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't speak for a long time, like she was trying to assess my
          situation in her head and come up with a solution.
        </p>
        <p>After a while, she stood straighter. "Okay, breathe—"</p>
        <p>"I am fucking breathing."</p>
        <p>"I know, I just need you to calm down—"</p>
        <p>
          "I am calm." I snapped, knowing I was a long distance away from calm
          now.
        </p>
        <p>"What mistake were you talking about?" she asked carefully.</p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my mouth, taking three steps backward before I
          turned and started to pace, trying to center my mind and my thoughts,
          wondering why every fiber of my being thought it was okay to confide
          in her or let her see this side to me. We weren't friends, or were we?
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "I let someone live," I dug my thumb finger into the palm of my other
          hand, trying to stop the shaking as I glanced at her, seeing her
          confused expression. "She's pregnant, and I ruined her life and let
          her live. She should be dead."
        </p>
        <p>"Whom are you talking—"</p>
        <p>"The artist's wife, Sofia."</p>
        <p>"What artist."</p>
        <p>
          "The one who painted the chihuahua, damn it, Zahra, keep up with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know what you're talking about; I'm trying to understand
          you!" she yelled in frustration. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My attention drew back to her when she let out a sigh. I watched her
          eyes grow unfocused before she outstretched her hand toward the bed.
          "Let's sit and talk." She said in Spanish. "Your pacing is not helping
          your case." <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          "It helps me get my thoughts in order," I responded in the dialect.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, sitting helps me sometimes, so we're going to do what I want
          because I don't think you're in the right state of mind to
          <i>think</i>." She continued, her tone curling softly around her
          accent, and I succumbed, settling on the edge of the bed while she
          took the space beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, you didn't hurt her; what would you have gained if you hurt her?"
        </p>
        <p>"Peace."</p>
        <p>
          I could feel her stare on the side of my face as she asked. "Are you
          certain?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I dug my thumb even deeper into my palm, but my fingers still shook;
          the veins on my hand were so visible, and my fingers grew so cold.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you certain that's what you would feel afterward?"</p>
        <p>I dropped my brows in a frown. "I don't know."</p>
        <p>
          Zahra's hand covered mine, eradicating the vacant cold and replacing
          it with a warmth that stopped the shaking instantly. "Elio, did you
          want to hurt them? The artist and his wife?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My head turned towards her, and our gazes locked as I answered. "Yes."
        </p>
        <p>"Because you thought you had to?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because I wanted to. I killed her husband right in front of her. And
          I told him—I <i>warned</i> him not to dismiss my question or supply me
          with a half-truth and a lie, and he did just that. I didn't want it to
          come to that, I gave him a chance to survive, but he didn't take it;
          they never take it."
        </p>
        <p>"Still, you didn't kill her—"</p>
        <p>
          "I <i>wanted</i> to. I wanted her dead; I wanted her buried, I still
          do, because if it doesn't happen, I will lose my mind."
        </p>
        <p>
          She removed my thumb from my palm and held my hand. "Why do you think
          you'll lose your mind?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I didn't finish the job, Zahra. I always finish the job, no
          matter how bloody or gruesome; I leave no stone unturned, my word is
          law, and if I go against it, I lose myself." I said, but it came out
          monotone, like a pledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          She frowned. "Are you reciting that from a memory, or do you really
          mean it?"
        </p>
        <p>I paused.</p>
        <p>
          Her question sank in with a cold shiver tickling my neck and my feet,
          and for a second,
          <i
            >I was out of this room, this space, this time. And I was watching
            myself, strapped to a chair, my neck against a cold metal; my eyes
            opened wide to be burned by the sharp blue ray of light that kept
            zooming in and out of focus, dropping me in a hypnotic state. A
            state that had me feeling numb in my feet, buried inside a large
            container of ice.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Repeat the word, soldier!" My private commander's voice boomed in
            the echoing room. "I always finish the job..."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >My eyes, wide and unseeing, stared above as my mouth, thirsty and
            dry, forced itself to move, repeating after him. I didn't want to,
            but my mind wasn't my own anymore; somehow, he managed to control my
            vocal cords. It was violating, but I couldn't help myself.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"Louder soldier!" </i></p>
        <p><i>"I always finish the job..." </i></p>

          <i
            >"Continue," he said like we had done this a thousand times before,
            and I would know the words.</i

        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Surprisingly, I continued talking. "...no matter how bloody or
            gruesome, I leave no stone unturned, my word is law, and if I go
            against it, I lose myself."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>"Elio."</p>
        <p>I blinked. Coming out of my head.</p>
        <p>"Did you mean that?" she said, concern and question in her eyes.</p>
        <p>Goosebumps littered my skin at that flash of...memory?"</p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know." I shook my head, looking away from her. "Yes, I wanted
          to do it, but I didn't want to, <i>want</i> to do it because I don't
          think that's who I am—"
        </p>
        <p>"Who are you?"</p>
        <p>
          My grip tightened around her hand. "I don't know. I am a different
          person when I'm with Casmiro and Angelo; I am different when I'm with
          Elia; I am different when I'm with my soldiers and associates; I am
          different when I'm with normal people outside my world...." I looked
          at her. "I'm different when I'm with you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened an inch, and I caught her pupils dilating in reaction
          to my words.
        </p>
        <p>She had captivating eyes.</p>
        <p>
          I looked down at our hands together, my thumb absentmindedly stroking
          her knuckles. "There are too many versions of myself that I don't know
          which part of me is real anymore. I don't know who my name belongs
          to."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think your name belongs to the person before me; trying to find who
          he is."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          My mind flashed to the memory I had somehow seemed to have forgotten.
          The man questioning me had been in uniform, which means it was from a
          time in the army. Did I make up that memory, or did it...happen?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where's your mind?" She asked, still in Spanish; we hadn't switched
          to English because this way seemed more comfortable, more effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met her gaze. "Nowhere," I lied. "Why are you sitting here,
          willingly talking to me?"
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Why do you care—" No...I <i>don't</i> want to make assumptions, so I
          reworded the question. "Do you care?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked taken off guard by my question, and I watched her draw back
          from me, subtly taking her hand from mine, leaving it cold. I had the
          strongest urge to take her hand back, but I didn't want to cross a
          boundary or scare her away, so I just clasped my hands together
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra swallowed, switching to English. "I—I have a hero complex. I
          think. I'm not a monster; even though I do not like you, I won't leave
          you when you're clearly going through stuff you need to talk about."
        </p>
        <p>"So...you care?"</p>
        <p>
          "That's not care; that's me. I'll do it for anyone, even if it's a
          stranger on the fucking street," she looked uncomfortable, tucking her
          hair behind her ear as she added. "It's who I am."
        </p>
        <p>
          I said nothing; I just sat there staring at her while she squirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I mean—you kind of did blame me for your state, and part of why I
          talked to you was because I didn't like you accusing me for your
          unstable state of mind."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, you are a huge part of the reason, Sport."</p>
        <p>
          She opened her mouth to counter my statement but closed it again like
          she had forgotten what she wanted to say. I took the liberty to
          continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "From the moment you left that board room till now, I've been unable
          to stop thinking about you."
        </p>
        <p>
          She sucked in a breath, looking away from me to stare ahead...it was
          faint, very faint, but I caught the slight reddening in her cheeks
          before she turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus fucking Christ, why are you so blunt with your feelings." She
          muttered.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm too old to beat around the bush."</p>
        <p>
          She turned to me with a smug look that almost washed the flush from
          her cheeks, but I could still see the ghost of them.
        </p>
        <p>"I thought you said thirty-three wasn't old?"</p>
        <p>
          "I meant that I'm not a 16-year-old boy who would deny his feelings
          because of his pride."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I have learned that it's better to keep your feelings to
          yourself, or they will be used against you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That begs the question of why I saw you pacing outside my house like
          seeing me would break the barrier for whatever troubled you. Why did
          you come to me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips thinned, pressed together like she was biting the inside of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to reach forward and use my thumb to stop her from worrying
          it...but that would make me want to kiss her—I want to kiss her—but
          unfortunately, that's never going to happen again, so I clasped my
          hands tighter, banishing the thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>"You really want to know the reason why I'm here?"</p>
        <p>"You might as well state it now that you have my attention."</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze flickered between mine, so guarded, so cautious about letting
          slip what she had wanted to tell me. I wondered what made her this
          way, locked in herself, beyond reach to anyone who wanted to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine. You—maybe haven't been the—the only one who's been a mess these
          past weeks. I've been screwing shit up for STREET, and Dog is ready to
          rip my head apart. A few hours ago, we were at a brunch, and I
          completely forgot the fake name I had told the guy who was supposed to
          have information about the next painting, and I had to fake a faint to
          avoid it. It was a disaster because I can't fake a faint to save my
          life—" she breathed. "Silver lining is that you were right; I think we
          need to talk about the—the incident at the rooftop."
        </p>
        <p>"Incident?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know, okay? occurrence, situation—"</p>
        <p>
          "You don't think it was a fucked-up night filled with raging hormones?
          Your words."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I—" She sighed. "I wasn't in a good mood when I said all that. If
          we're going to be mutual—or friends or whatever, you should know that
          I say things I don't mean when I'm in a mood. And that day, I was in a
          mood."
        </p>
        <p>"In a mood," I repeated.</p>
        <p>"Yes, Elio, are you slow?"</p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head, staring at her as I recalled when I'd asked her the
          same question in that car right before the chase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I curled my lips into a smile that turned into a small half-laugh as I
          looked away from her, shaking my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was silent for like three beats before she spoke up. "Did you
          just—did you just laugh?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile died, and I wore a blank look before turning to look at her
          again with a frown. "No."
        </p>
        <p>"But I just—" she looked unsure. "I swear—stop fucking with me."</p>
        <p>"You are not making any sense," I said with the same stern look.</p>
        <p>
          "I just heard you laugh, and you literally smiled. Not the sick one
          from the other time; it was charming, do it again."
        </p>
        <p>"You are delusional."</p>
        <p>
          "I am not." She said, uncertainty in her eyes. "God, you're good with
          this shit. Bipolar asshole."
        </p>
        <p>"I am not bipolar."</p>
        <p>"You are; you just don't know it yet."</p>
        <p>
          "I had a diagnosis done. I am not bipolar; you're probably going crazy
          with all the drugs you take with your friend." I tilted my head
          slowly, watching her with a mock concerned frown. "Maybe you need a
          diagnosis. You're hallucinating; I don't want a mentally ill person
          looking for that painting. You'll drag the others down."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn, you're good," she slapped my arm excitedly. "You're making me
          think <i>I'm</i>crazy. How the fuck do you do that? Teach me."
        </p>
        <p>
          The urge to smile tugged at me, but I bit it back. "You're a case,
          Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>I missed this.</p>
        <p>
          She laughed. "Okay, back to the issue on ground." She said, angling
          her body to face mine. "We're both distracted. It's obvious there's
          something here," she motioned between us. "Something we don't want—"
        </p>
        <p>"How do you know I don't want it?"</p>
        <p>"You said you didn't like me—"</p>
        <p>"I don't want to but—"</p>
        <p>
          "Great, I don't like you too, but there's obvious physical attraction,
          and for us to get it out of our systems, I suggest we fuck it out and
          resume this animosity without compromise."
        </p>
        <p>
          I jumbled her words in my head, imagining her beneath me, atop me,
          beside me, sweaty and undone. It was very shameless and odd for my
          mind to conjure such vivid images but—
        </p>
        <p>"How can you suggest this when you're involved with my brother?"</p>
        <p>
          "That's history. It ended recently..." she frowned before continuing.
          "Scratch that; it ended a long time ago; I just didn't know it—still,
          even if it does happen, between us—No one can find out. Devil can
          <i>never</i> find out; I made him a promise."
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised a brow at her, moving closer until I could feel her breath on
          my face. I lowered the tone of my voice like it was a sin for a third
          party to listen in. "A promise you want to break with a man who has
          only ever broken promises when it comes to him, some friend you are."
        </p>
        <p>
          She glared at me, but her tongue trotted out, rubbing against her
          bottom lip. "I don't want it, okay? But—I feel like if we cross this
          off, it'll disappear."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't feel the same."</p>
        <p>"So you don't want to fuck me?" she asked with a taunting smile.</p>
        <p>
          My eyes roamed her face, down to the swell of her breast caged inside
          that dress; an image of me taking it off filtered past my brain before
          I locked eyes with her again. "I do, but I also want to talk to you."
        </p>
        <p>"You want to be friends..." she drawled. "Friends who fuck."</p>
        <p>
          "No. Friends don't do that, but whatever definition you think suits
          our...<i>one-time</i>compromise."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lust stained her eyes. "You're still on my shit list, and I'm still
          going to kill you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, unable to comprehend how I could manage a fucking erection
          after literally breaking in front of this woman. "If you annoy me, I
          still won't hesitate to slit your throat."
        </p>
        <p>Her gaze centered on my lips. "Good."</p>
        <p>"Good," I responded.</p>
        <p>She leaned in, aiming to kiss me, but I drew back. "No."</p>
        <p>She frowned. "No?"</p>
        <p>"Ground rules."</p>
        <p>
          She rolled her eyes. "Jesus Christ, Elio, it's just sex, and no, I'm
          not saying we should do it now—" Her gaze dropped to my crotch, where
          I was sure she spotted my need for her. "unless you want to," she
          looked back at me. "You're—"
        </p>
        <p>"Not now, but I still want to set ground rules."</p>
        <p>She sighed. "Right, fine, let's hear it."</p>
        <p>"One: No kissing."</p>
        <p>Her eyes widened. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Two: It only happens once. No more. You don't touch me sexually
          without my permission."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah but—"</p>
        <p>"Three: You don't forget any of the first two."</p>
        <p>"Why no kissing? We kissed on the rooftop, so—."</p>
        <p>"For reasons best known to me, I don't want to."</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze dropped to my lips longingly before she shook her head.
          "Fine." She said half-heartedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. Before then, I'd like you to accompany me to a business dinner in
          Turin."
        </p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"That...I don't know yet; I would like you there."</p>
        <p>"And what do I tell STREET?"</p>
        <p>
          "You're a liar; I'm sure you can come up with something. Or you could
          tell them the truth. You're accompanying a friend you want to kill to
          a business dinner."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't even know why I'm agreeing to this."</p>
        <p>"Makes two of us." I lied.</p>
        <p>Her eyes searched mine. "How are you feeling now?"</p>
        <p>"Hard, uncomfortable."</p>
        <p>"I meant about your...earlier state." She stated cautiously.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh..." I completely forgot about my earlier state, and even with her
          reminder, I didn't feel the heaviness. "Better."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was no secret that she had a negative effect on me. Still, the
          positive effects intrigued me, she brought me back from a raging ten
          to a calming zero, and I still couldn't remember how our conversation
          had slowly shifted from a serious discussion to this.
        </p>
        <p>Then again, that was how it was with her. <br /></p>
        <p>
          I lost sense of my mind and surroundings; the feeling was new, and
          like every new feeling I got, I wanted to explore it.
        </p>
        <p>Hence, why I wanted her with me on my trip to Turin.</p>
        <p>
          And, of course, I wouldn't tell her any of that. She was too guarded,
          too cautious. I needed to take it slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was right, there was something here, and it wasn't just the
          physical attraction. It was no news that I was beginning to get
          addicted to her presence, but that wasn't the only reason I had been a
          complete mess for the past three weeks; there was something else.
        </p>
        <p><i>But...What else?</i></p>
        <p>There.</p>
        <p>
          That was the million-dollar question, and I'd do anything to find the
          answer.<br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>"IT DOESN'T </b>make any sense."</p>
        <p>
          I refrained from looking at Devil, who watched me pick up the small
          black glitter purse I'd snagged from Milk's collection. Something to
          go with the ankle-length dress I wore with a slit that reached my
          mid-thigh. Nothing I loved more than free movement, even when wearing
          a dress.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you totally sure about this?" Upper asked from his leaning
          position on my bedroom doorway. "What if he wants to take you
          somewhere it'll be easy to—I don't know—chop your bloody head off?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes, letting out a tired sigh. "You guys are like
          brothers I didn't ask for."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's nothing <i>brotherly </i>about this," Devil said, and the
          edge to his voice made me glance at him, spotting the scowl of
          disapproval on his face. "I don't like this, Z."
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been in a shitty mood since I told them about the business
          dinner I was attending with Elio. While I had expected instant
          disapproval from all of them, Devil was beginning to get on my fucking
          nerves with this whole controlling thing he had going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, maybe there was a small bite of guilt in my stomach every time
          he reminded me how terrible a person his brother was.
        </p>
        <p>Fine, Elio was bad...but not <i>that</i> bad. He just needs help.</p>
        <p>
          If I presented my narrative about him to Devil, it would raise
          questions, so I did the next best thing; even though it felt like I
          was betraying Elio, I agreed with Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my lips together, checking my reflection one last time
          before I responded to him. "I don't like it either. But to study your
          enemy, you've got to get close to them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "He already gave us a deal." Devil pointed out, uncrossing his arms
          while leaning away from the wardrobe door. "We signed a contract. We
          don't need to cross their path any more than we already have. This
          whole dinner thing makes absolutely no sense. Why did you even agree
          to it? When did you both talk?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, Milk appeared in the doorway, brushing past Upper with a
          jewelry box in her hand. "Silver will never betray you; it also goes
          perfectly with the dress."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra." Devil's voice called, sharper this time.</p>
        <p>
          I breathed out sharply and pinned him with a frown. "You know him more
          than anyone, Devil. You know what he's capable of, and you also know
          he is a man without morals, a man who doesn't honor loyalty. Do you
          think a piece of paper will guarantee our freedom out of here or the
          promise of a hundred million dollars which, mind you, they just agreed
          to give us on a whim? No negotiation? I am going to make sure he sees
          us as business partners and not pawns on his chessboard."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's why you're leaving without any disguise? You want people in
          his political setting to see you both together? And then what? You
          accompany him to other business dinners?" Devil interjected.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think Zahra's right," Milk said as she helped me put on the
          earrings and necklace. "It's not exactly safe to go anywhere with
          Marino, seeing as we don't know his intentions, but don't you think
          it's stupid to believe that when all this is over, and we find the
          gold and his flash drives, we'll be free to go? Just like that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It never happens that way in movies," Upper supported, "the bad guys
          always find a way to fuck the good guys over. It's the bloody rule of
          heroes and villains. You ought to earn the villain's respect if you
          ever want them to trust you enough to let you go when all is said and
          done."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, Upper," I said with a sigh of appreciation before my gaze
          settled on Devil, who still looked very uncomfortable. "It's going to
          be fine. I have my phone with me; Upper installed a tracking device
          earlier. If by chance the tracker stops working, I have Dog on speed
          dial."
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost as if I summoned him, he popped his head behind Upper. "I'd
          probably leave you to die. You should really stop calling me first
          when there's trouble—also, Casper is out front waiting for you—and why
          the fuck is that purse shining?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Glitter, idiot." Milk muttered in annoyance. "You're good to go,
          Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"Thanks."</p>
        <p>
          Because I knew Devil was still frowning and fuming with disapproval, I
          didn't say anything as I exited my room and the house. And, of course,
          they all followed behind me like ants.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I swear to God, you guys are embarrassing," I said with a groan and a
          frown that slipped out of my face the moment I took in the car parked
          outside the building; Casmiro was leaning against it, a stern frown on
          his face as he waited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adorned in a grey fitted suit, with hair combed to perfection, he
          screamed dangerous wealth and annoyance. One I was certain came from
          the fact that I was going on this trip with his Boss, who hadn't come
          to fetch me himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why did I think he would be the one standing here and not Casmiro?
        </p>
        <p>
          I brushed the thought of Elio from my head and focused on the car. It
          was the same Lamborghini I had watched drown over a month ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone brushed past me, and I didn't have to look to know it was
          Upper.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Holy bloody fucking shit, I thought you said it drowned!" Upper threw
          an accusatory glance at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reached Casmiro, and I eyed the car and then him. "Yeah, it did.
          Did you get a new one, Cassie?"
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro straightened his suit. "I don't see how that's any of—"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh my God, please, can I touch it? Just one graze." Upper cut in with
          haste, staring with pleading wide eyes at Casmiro, who eyed him like
          this was the first time he was seeing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This motherfucking princeling bout to get nuked." Dog snickered,
          earning an elbow blow from Milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to cut in when Casmiro did the honors by asking, "You like
          cars?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you joking, mate? I'm obsessed." He looked from Casmiro to the
          car. "This is—she's bloody beautiful." He gushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were literal stars in Upper's eyes, and I watched Casmiro's gaze
          travel up and down the length of his body; it was subtle, but I caught
          it, and Upper probably did too because he was clearing his throat,
          taking a step back from the Lamborghini, cheeks turning bright red.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sorry," he said nervously. "I lose myself when I'm—when there's a
          beautiful car around me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's no crime, Arch—Upper. Maybe you can take her for a spin when I
          get back from the airport."
        </p>
        <p>Upper's jaw dropped. "What—seriously?"</p>
        <p>
          It was slow, but I watched how amusement grew in Casmiro's eyes. I'd
          only ever seen him frown, so it was pretty strange...to see him lose
          some of his guard just because Upper wanted to touch his car.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I admire people who admire cars," Casmiro said. "They are one of
          human's most phenomenal creations."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes—it's—God, thank you, Casper—I mean, Casmiro."</p>
        <p>
          "You can call me Cas," Casmiro said, his lips lifting to the side in a
          small decent smile.
        </p>
        <p>Upper blinked at him. "Ye—Cas. Thank you, Cas."</p>
        <p>
          And just like that, the rest of us standing here were background
          noise, and I took that short period to steal a glance at Devil, whose
          scowl had dropped as he watched the two of them, chest heaving
          slightly in what I could tell was withheld anger.
        </p>
        <p>At the sight, I cleared my throat, and Upper flinched.</p>
        <p>"We should get going, Cassie."</p>
        <p>
          From my periphery, Devil had already turned, making his way back to
          the house without a second glance our way. I made a mental note to
          check on him with a text later in the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk had to pull Upper away from the side of the car, and Dog left me
          with a <i>'make sure to be with your phone at all times.' </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, I was heading to the airport beside Casmiro
          inside the Lamborghini.
        </p>
        <p>
          His usual frown was now back on his face. I didn't like silence, and I
          didn't know why the man disliked me. <i>I am very likable</i>, at
          least; I like to think so.
        </p>
        <p>"So—"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't speak to me; we're almost at the airport; just shut up until we
          get there, and you get the fuck out of my car." He shunned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to leave him be. I did. But I was curious and had a thing for
          poking angry bears. And right now, Cassie right here was very fucking
          angry. "You seriously don't have to be so rude."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I own the right to how I choose to relate with you," he said, his
          tone hard and unwelcoming.
        </p>
        <p>I shifted with a frown, genuinely curious.</p>
        <p>"Why do you dislike me so much?"</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You're always rude to me. You look at me like I kicked your dog to
          death. You don't even know me."
        </p>
        <p>He glanced my way briefly, ignoring me.</p>
        <p>
          "I thought you were this way with everyone in STREET, but you
          interacted kindly with Upper, so why are you unnecessarily rude."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not unnecessary."</p>
        <p>"Really? Pray tell, Cassie, what did I do to you?"</p>
        <p>His jaw clenched and unclenched. "I don't trust you."</p>
        <p>
          "Awesome, I don't exactly trust you either, but you don't see me being
          a raving bitch about it."
        </p>
        <p>
          His grip tightened on the steering wheel like he wanted nothing more
          than to reach over, open my side door, and push me out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm usually not a <i>raving bitch </i>to people I don't know, but I
          just don't like you, Zahra. I think you're full of shit."
        </p>
        <p>Or I could reach over, open his side door, and push him out.</p>
        <p>
          He stopped at a red light, looking over at me. "I read people, and I'm
          pretty sure Marino is good at reading people too, but for some fucked
          up reason, he's blinded when it comes to you."
        </p>
        <p>"Or maybe he's just a kind person who doesn't judge."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not judging you, Zahra. It's something I see. You have so many
          layers, so many hides; your eyes are so insincere, even with STREET. I
          don't trust you because I know you're hiding something. And whatever
          it is, it has to do with Martino Conti."
        </p>
        <p>I scoffed out a laugh, relaxing. "Seriously?"</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not an idiot. Marino isn't an idiot too. So, I'd advise you to
          stop whatever shit trap you're trying to make him fall into; he's not
          a saint. He will figure you out if he hasn't already."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, Cassie, why are you looking for answers where there's no
          question? Martino Conti used to be someone I worked for. What if I
          told you I was one of his housekeepers? I have scrubbed blood off
          wooden floors and stubborn rugs since I was 16—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would ask you if I had stupid tattooed on my forehead." He said
          with a glare and turned his attention back to the road when the light
          turned green again. "Like I said, you are full of shit, and I'm going
          to figure you out."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him for about a minute before looking ahead. "I wouldn't
          advise that, Casmiro."
        </p>
        <p>
          The tension inside the car thickened as my thumb finger absentmindedly
          stroked my purse.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The person who said curiosity killed the cat wasn't delusional when
          he said it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at me, and I caught his stare without a smile or a frown.
          "Stay out of my way, and I'll stay out of yours."
        </p>
        <p>"Is that a threat?" he asked, looking back at the road.</p>
        <p>
          "I have a job to do, Cassie. Find the gold, find your fucking flash
          drives, and then get the fuck out of Marino's compound. I despise
          compromise; that's why I'm giving you a subtle reminder that if you
          try to compromise my mission, I will not hesitate to retaliate."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That sounds like a threat." There was a warning in his voice, and I
          didn't give two shits.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Take it however you want to. If you have no intention of forming a
          mutual ground as I have done with Marino, then I am happy to make you
          my enemy."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The feeling is very mutual. I won't fall for your bullshit like
          everyone has, Zahra. I'm on to you, and when I find proof, I'll put
          you down myself."
        </p>
        <p>
          I ground my teeth together as I looked ahead, biting my tongue to stop
          myself from saying anything more, but my mind had already supplied me
          with an observation I had to look out for.
        </p>
        <p><i>He is going to be a problem. </i></p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Angelo collected me the moment Casmiro dropped me off at the airport,
          and with a subtle nod to each other, the man, who was now on my radar,
          drove off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike him, Angelo had greeted me; even though it wasn't warm, it was
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nice dress," He said, leading us to the private plane area, three
          guards behind us as we walked into an elevator.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks. Do you think I'm overdressed? Or underdressed. I'm not really
          used to fancy gatherings without being someone else." I said,
          adjusting the dress as the Elevator moved down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo glanced my way, giving me a subtle sweep. "Yeah, you're
          perfectly dressed. It's a business dinner that would house pompous men
          and their wives, girlfriend, or mistress."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh...makes me wonder why your boss wanted me there...."</p>
        <p>
          "Does it?" Angelo said, looking ahead. "I thought you shared an
          intimate relationship with him. The rooftop—"
        </p>
        <p>"What did he say?"</p>
        <p>
          "He didn't have to say anything," Angelo said, voice straight as he
          looked down at me. "But know that I'm watching you, Zahra. One wrong
          move against him, and you're out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why the fuck does everyone seem to think I have some grand ulterior
          motive? Cassie almost chewed my head off in that car. Now you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have nothing against you, Zahra. All I care about is Marino, he
          doesn't do things like this, so it only means whatever you both have
          is serious to him. The other day I caught you leaving his house, I'd
          like to think whatever you both are doing isn't one-sided from his
          end. I will haunt you if you hurt him. This is not a threat but a
          fact."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed. "I have no intention of hurting him...unless it is
          completely necessary and I have to protect myself. Then yeah."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're in no position to make comments like that; it makes it hard to
          trust you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The last thing anybody should do is trust me, Angie. Besides, it
          wasn't a comment. Just a fact."
        </p>
        <p>
          The elevator took that time to slide apart, and I walked out, spotting
          the plane right ahead, soldiers everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heels clicked and echoed on the ground as I walked, and I could
          also hear Angelo's footsteps behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eyes were on me, and I wasn't surprised. Apparently, Elio Marino never
          took dates to events like these, and I was an exception because he
          loved my company.
        </p>
        <p>Bullshit.</p>
        <p>He was up to something.</p>
        <p><i>Or maybe he does like my company? </i></p>
        <p>
          I hate compromises, and that was one of the main reasons I was putting
          up with his weird idea of foreplay. I needed to get him out of my
          system. I hated my want for him. It was fucking things up.
        </p>
        <p>The fact that this wasn't me was the most daunting part.</p>
        <p>
          I'd never outrightly wanted anyone's touch like I wanted Elio's. Devil
          was convenient, Martino was necessary, and the selected few were
          mainly by choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Elio... God, he evoked what I could only name as pure desire, and
          yes, the feeling scared me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo led me inside the plane, which was minimal, very clean, and
          private, like an en-suite lounge area, golden lights, and white
          leather seats. It Smelt divine, had a warm cozy feel to it, and I
          couldn't stop my eyes from roaming around the space as Angelo led me
          down a small compartment until he pushed open a door, and I was in an
          even more private room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same design as the other area we had just come through, but the
          smell was different, familiar. And I soon registered why that was
          after seeing Elio's figure at the corner, an unlit cigar between his
          lips, book in hand, wearing a black men's turtle neck and black pants.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't look up, even as Angelo announced my presence and left me
          alone with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the liberty to settle in the chair opposite him, appreciating
          the comfort of the leather and how appetizing the man sitting atop it
          was.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>My God. </i>Elio Marino harbored a consuming aura, which was doing
          funny things to my stomach and the back of my spine.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra," he said in greeting, his eyes going over the page.</p>
        <p>"Marino," I responded, and he looked up finally.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't call—" he stopped, eyes taking me in quickly before he
          completed his statement, "Me that."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, Dad,"</p>
        <p>
          His stare hardened, and he looked back at his book. "Stop." He
          muttered.
        </p>
        <p>I smiled at him...genuinely. "Any reason your cigar isn't lit?"</p>
        <p>"Still figuring out if I should light it."</p>
        <p>
          "Right," my gaze dropped to the table, seeing a black device. "I
          thought you said you didn't have a phone?"
        </p>
        <p>"It's new." He said, discarding the cigar.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, what made you get one?" I made conversation because, yes, sue me,
          he might be infuriating and might end up at the circle of my barrel
          when push comes to shove, but I liked talking to him too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite what Casmiro and Angelo feel about me getting close to Elio, I
          knew something was there. If we do away with the inconvenient physical
          attraction, we could be friends...cordial, at least.
        </p>
        <p>His gaze flickered to me and then to the phone.</p>
        <p>
          I raised a brow at the conflict in his eyes, and then he closed the
          book, dropping it perfectly beside the phone as he said, "Because
          almost everyone I know has one."
        </p>
        <p>"Cool...want my number?" I asked.</p>
        <p>His eyes took me in again. "What for?"</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "I don't know, we could be text buddies since we're
          like—trying to be friends—"
        </p>
        <p><i>What is wrong with my speech? </i></p>
        <p>"Thank you, but I have no use for your number."</p>
        <p>It was like someone had punched my chest in. "Ouch."</p>
        <p>"I meant that politely. If I ever need it, I'll ask for it."</p>
        <p>
          Forcing on a smile, I shifted uncomfortably. "Right," I said, looking
          out the window by the side, seeing everyone gearing up for the flight
          to take off.
        </p>
        <p>
          His response had rattled me. I didn't know why it stung, but it did.
        </p>
        <p>This was a sign. Maybe we were spending too much time together.</p>
        <p>
          I was not supposed to like him or be <i>fond</i> of him. I should have
          noticed it whenever I had the powering urge to defend Elio whenever
          Devil said something to contradict what I felt regarding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was growing on me. He doesn't need to know, but his name was on
          the brink of being erased from my shit list.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this was not because I really wanted to fuck him. No. This had to
          do with him as a person.
        </p>
        <p>He was right when he said we were alike.</p>
        <p>We are.</p>
        <p>
          "I feel like I've said something wrong." He voiced, making me look
          back at him.
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Your guard is up again. Is this because I don't want your phone
          number?"
        </p>
        <p>I was transparent to this man, and it was dangerous.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm a big girl; I'll get over it," I said with a tight smile I'd
          wanted to be carefree, but my mood wasn't shifting or lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, picked up the phone from the table, and got to his feet.
        </p>
        <p>For some unknown reason, my heart skipped a bit.</p>
        <p>
          I often knew how to predict people, but I raised my guard for this man
          because he was the most unpredictable person I'd ever encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
          He crossed the space between us and sat beside me, clouding my senses
          with his cologne. I couldn't think straight for a good minute.
        </p>
        <p>"Here," he outstretched his phone to me. "Put in your number."</p>
        <p>I blinked at him. "What?"</p>
        <p>"Your number." He repeated.</p>
        <p>"I thought you didn't want it?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't," he stated. "But apparently, that upset you, so if putting
          your number would make you feel better, then here. We can be—" he
          clenched his jaw like he didn't want to say it but cleared his throat
          and completed, "Text buddies."
        </p>
        <p>My eyes searched his and then dropped to the phone.</p>
        <p>
          The normal Zahra would brush it off, raise her chin up and never
          <i>ever</i> give him her number, but this Zahra, whomever the fuck she
          was, was collecting his phone and saving her number.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was done, I gave him the phone back, and his fingers tapped on
          the screen for a short moment. I briefly wondered what he was doing
          until my phone vibrated inside my purse.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at him, and he gestured with his chin toward the purse on my
          lap. I took my phone out swiftly and smiled when I saw a message from
          an unknown number. It was a simple. <b>'Hello.'</b> With a freaking
          full stop at the back of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Happy?" he asked, making me look back at him, the color of his eyes
          holding my breath for a few seconds.
        </p>
        <p>"You are weird," I told him.</p>
        <p>
          "I know." He said, gaze flickering to my hair before his hand moved,
          and he grazed the tip softly with his fingers, feeling the texture but
          not overdoing it as if he didn't want to scare me away. "I love what
          you did with your hair."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't look away from him. Therefore, it was hard to hide the
          evidence of the heat that rushed to my cheek. "I—just brushed it."
        </p>
        <p>"It's beautiful."</p>
        <p>"What's your angle?" I asked.</p>
        <p>His gaze seemed like he was drinking my face in.</p>
        <p>"Elio."</p>
        <p>"Hm?"</p>
        <p>"What's your angle?" I asked in Spanish.</p>
        <p>
          "I have no angle. You look outstanding. I like the dress too, and the
          purse. We're matching."
        </p>
        <p><i>What the fuck?</i></p>
        <p>
          "You wear black every day; I'm sure you match with tons of people in
          this world who wear black."
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head. "No, it looks different when you wear it."</p>
        <p>"Are you flirting with me?"</p>
        <p>"I don't flirt. I tell."</p>
        <p>"Right."</p>
        <p>
          His attention remained solely on me; while it was unnerving, it felt
          good.
        </p>
        <p>"So, anything I should prepare for with this dinner?"</p>
        <p>
          "I do not think you need to prepare." His eyes looked between mine. "I
          have a gut feeling you know precisely what to do at events like
          these."
        </p>
        <p>"So, you're trusting me based on a gut feeling?"</p>
        <p>"Exactly."</p>
        <p>
          There was a challenge in his eyes, and I knew if I tried to deny
          anything now, he would pick out my lie, so I let it be.
        </p>
        <p>
          And minutes later, as the plane took off, I wondered briefly if Devil
          had been right.
        </p>
        <p>Was I walking into a trap?</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          We had gotten to the business dinner quite fashionably late. The event
          center was large, with different wafts of expensive perfumes in the
          air. An orchestra band at the far end of the table Elio and I sat.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we arrived earlier, Elio had headed straight to the governor of
          Turin, and while I didn't pay attention to the conversation, I could
          tell the governor held the man on my arm in high regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio had surprisingly introduced me as his friend, using my name. I
          didn't mind; I was prepared for this evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'd stopped by other people; introductions were made, and fake but
          polite laughs and compliments filtered through the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had also been getting looks from women around me. Some were mostly
          curious, and others judged with their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio might not have noticed or pretended not to, but he held me to his
          side with pride and asked Angelo to clearly do something because, like
          us, Angelo was moving around and making conversations. People were
          pulling him here and there, trying to pick out his knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          About an hour later, an announcement and speech were made. We were
          settled on a dinner table with the governor, his wife and son, Angelo,
          a neighboring local mayor, and his family, and some minister with whom
          I'd forgotten his name, sat with his wife and daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio had gone quiet beside me, but conversations passed freely around
          the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bringing my wine glass to my lips, I looked around the large room
          where conversations, laughter, and clanking of forks to plates
          resounded in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze connected with a gruff-looking man at a far-off table; it
          stayed for two seconds before he looked away. I took a sip of my
          drink, looking at the table two spaces away from him, two men, one in
          a maroon suit and the other with a striped black and white one, looked
          my way before subtly looking away. I swallowed the drink, looking up
          to the railing where two men stood with drinks in hand, conversing
          before they glanced my way, and looked away only seconds after.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought my attention back to my own table, stopping short when I
          caught Angelo staring at me. The suspicion in his eyes was so evident
          that I couldn't help but curl up one side of my lips in a smirk while
          raising my glass to him before looking away to a tense Elio beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          His attention was not on the table, and when I followed his gaze, I
          found he was staring at a woman who sat at the table next to ours. She
          was laughing loud at what someone at her table had said.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned.</p>
        <p>
          He was staring intently at her, which made me size her up. She was a
          gorgeous model figure beauty, with a beautiful smile, long curly light
          brown hair that somehow reached her back, and soft painted lips that
          could be considered charming, to say the least.
        </p>
        <p>
          My frown deepened as I looked back at Elio, whose attention had
          utterly left the woman to another table.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed his gaze, and lo and behold; he was staring at another
          woman. This one was a platinum blonde, long hair straightened to
          perfection. She wore a strapless dress. Heart-shaped face and a cupid
          bow's mouth. Minimal makeup. Really beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fingers on the table drummed absentmindedly; my gaze dropped to
          his knee beside me; it was bouncing rapidly underneath the table.
        </p>
        <p>He seemed so tense.</p>
        <p>
          I looked back at him to see his gaze on yet another woman; this one
          had auburn hair pulled up in a ponytail, loose strands falling down
          her face as she smiled at the conversation going around their table.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't his girlfriend or anything, but fuck if I didn't want to bash
          his head on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was also strange because Elio didn't seem like the kind of man
          to be this blatantly rude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subtly, I shifted my chair near his and placed my hand on his knee.
          "Hey."
        </p>
        <p>
          The shaking stopped, and he turned to look at me, grey eyes locking
          with my bright brown ones.
        </p>
        <p>I ran my hand up his thigh. "Focus on me, will you?"</p>
        <p>
          His gaze dropped to my hand on his thigh, and I noticed how he grew
          more tense upon my touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment, the governor called his attention with a question. He
          looked away from me and didn't say anything about my hand on his thigh
          under the table; he just conversed with the governor with complete
          control in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand rubbed his thigh smoothly, thumb brushing against the inner
          side, trying to calm his nerves...or...make it worse, because he
          wasn't getting calm. His body was growing more tense, and I had an
          inkling feeling that he was hard, though his voice was steady as he
          spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          I almost cursed myself for the idea that crossed my mind, but my brain
          had stopped transporting reasonable thoughts to my hand as it moved
          further up his thigh under the table until my finger brushed against
          his crotch.
        </p>
        <p>My stomach jumped with excitement when I felt his semi-hard-on.</p>
        <p>I should stop.</p>
        <p>I was going against his rules.</p>
        <p>
          Rules? Pfft. I'd never been one to abide by them, and I sure as hell
          won't start now.
        </p>
        <p>
          So instead of stopping, I felt him up, rubbing against his erection
          which grew harder by the second, thanks to the stimulation coming from
          my hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could feel the huge outline of him, and I was grateful that his
          trench coat was long enough to shield any eyes from behind us; even if
          it wasn't, I was pretty sure we were covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor asked him another question about something that had to do
          with a small town in Milan. Elio responded, voice still leveled, all
          attention on him, including mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I marveled at his level of control and decorum. The look on his face
          didn't give away the fact that he was getting strokes from my hand
          underneath the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went on to explain some talk that had to do with citizens' data.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand skillfully brushed the outline of his cock, squeezing a little
          as I gave one tight rub.
        </p>
        <p>
          His breath hitched loudly—in fact—he stopped talking altogether, and
          our table went silent, waiting for him to continue while wondering
          what had happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, ever so slowly, his head turned toward me, and he placed me
          under his very calm stare as he said in Spanish, loud enough for
          everyone on the table to hear. "Don't start what you can't finish."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes widened in surprise, and I felt my cheeks heat up as he turned
          back to the governor, who looked between us with amused confusion; it
          was almost the same look everyone at the table threw at us.
        </p>
        <p>I removed my hand quickly.</p>
        <p>
          Elio continued what he was saying as if he hadn't just stopped the
          whole conversation to scold me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't embarrassed. Fuck, I was turned on.
          <i>I've never been so turned on like I am right now. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          When the conversation shifted from Elio, he stayed for about two
          minutes before he excused himself to the bathroom, not before sending
          a pointed glare at me. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my lip, waited for exactly three minutes after he
          left, and then I excused myself too, walking down the direction he had
          gone through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was that subtle? No. Did half the table know I was going after him?
          Yes. Did I give a fuck about what they thought?
        </p>
        <p>Hell.</p>
        <p>Fucking.</p>
        <p>No. <br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>I WAS </b>thinking with my dick.</p>
        <p>
          I never think with my dick. I never think or <i>use</i> the word
          '<i>dick</i>.' It was no consternation that I was gone. Too far gone
          into whatever fog the feeling that came with Zahra brought to my head,
          and I could either get rid of it or lean into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I was honest with myself, getting rid of it was next to impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          My actions and thoughts around the time I'd set out those rules to
          Zahra could be considered laughable at this very moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I planned to stick to the no-kissing rule because I had no other
          choice...but the other rule...
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra Faizan wasn't a woman you could touch once and be satisfied. The
          woman was slow poison, sinking and slipping into your veins with an
          alluring sensation that could turn any active brain to mush.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I'd fallen victim to this poison.</p>
        <p>
          My control slipped right at that dinner table, and I had done
          something I'd never thought I'd do in a million years. I'd gotten
          distracted. Allowed Zahra to touch me, which was the most
          unprofessional I'd ever been.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never played with politics or toyed with that side of the business
          because it was one of the things I looked up to when dusk gave way for
          dawn to rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right when she entered the plane, my mind had already registered that
          she'd come in disguise. I never thought she would arrive without one.
          It took me by surprise. I couldn't help but stare like I'd never seen
          a beautiful woman.
        </p>
        <p><i>I was gone from that moment. </i></p>
        <p>
          Her hair was styled so beautifully. I couldn't erase the image of
          sinking my fingers into the mild curly waves of them, getting my fill
          of its fullness and softness, melting into the abyss of how beautiful
          it smelt, and then pulling until her neck craned and became mine to
          kiss, lick and suck until I bruised her clear skin. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The flight had been spent with me fighting a battle with my mind, my
          brain, and my hand.
        </p>
        <p>But I had to take it slow with her.</p>
        <p>
          I'd confirmed she wasn't with Elia anymore, and while that shouldn't
          have changed anything, it changed a lot.
        </p>
        <p>My thinking was never this shallow or careless.</p>
        <p>
          I might not know consequences, but when it came to Elia, I was not
          particularly eager to mess around. He already hated me. The last thing
          I wanted was to rile him to the state where he'd point a gun at me and
          eventually pull the trigger because no matter how badly I wanted to
          live and die on my preferred term, I would never move away from a shot
          aimed at me by my brother.
        </p>
        <p>He had a free pass to put an end to my life.</p>
        <p>
          But now, there was a problem. If it were anything else, I'd leave it
          be; but Zahra had woven her webs so thick around the body of my mind.
          I lost my control and, apparently, my common sense.
        </p>
        <p>I let her touch me.</p>
        <p>I wanted her to touch me.</p>
        <p>
          Even though I had made sure to pay less attention to her, stop myself
          from reaching over and touching her, and look for something else to
          admire to ease this nefarious addiction, I couldn't help but compare
          every woman in this event to the woman by my side.
        </p>
        <p>It was infuriatingly inconvenient.</p>
        <p>
          I do not compare women. I had too much respect for them to do that.
          But I couldn't help my train of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back at that table, I knew nothing else but the warmth of her hand on
          my thigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          That simple touch ignited a fire inside of me. One I couldn't control,
          one that had made me envision myself pulling her with me to a place
          where no one would catch a glimpse of her bare skin when I fucked that
          attitude right back to a place she'd never be able to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          These thoughts were very foreign. They had never once grazed my mind
          when it came to other women.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought I was mad, but Zahra Faizan was driving me to the brink of
          what absolute madness felt like.
        </p>
        <p>Now I'm hard, uncomfortable, and frustrated.</p>
        <p>
          I pushed into the men's washroom. Thankfully it was empty. I just had
          to calm down, get my head in order, and hope for the erection Zahra
          had coaxed to calm down.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked to the gold and white fancy sinks and shrugged off my coat
          before placing it on the sink next to the one I was in front of.
        </p>
        <p>I knew exactly what to do to get myself back in control.</p>
        <p>
          The only massive turn-off I could ever get was the sight of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not the best method, but I needed to start thinking with my head and
          not my—
        </p>
        <p>
          The door opened, drawing my attention from the mirror to the last
          person I needed in my presence right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The witch carried a sly smile as she closed the door behind her and
          leaned on it, both hands behind her in an innocent stance, bottom lip
          tucked under her teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clenched my jaw; the sight of her tightened the knot in my chest,
          and the strain in my pants.
        </p>
        <p>Control.</p>
        <p><i>Control, Marino. </i></p>
        <p>
          She released her bottom lip, drawing my attention to its flush
          redness.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hi there," she said with a taunting smile, her eyes flickering to my
          crotch and back to me. "Got anything I could help you with?"
        </p>
        <p>"No. Get out."</p>
        <p>
          Her smile drew up as she leaned away from the door, twirling left and
          right with hands behind her as she walked towards me.
        </p>
        <p>"You don't really mean that," she said.</p>
        <p>
          "Get out, Zahra; this is the men's washroom," I said, my eyes
          flickering to the door, knowing anyone could walk in at any second.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't mind." She smiled.</p>
        <p>"I mind." I gritted out.</p>
        <p>Instead of leaving, she advanced toward me.</p>
        <p><i>Control.</i></p>
        <p>"Leave Zah—"</p>
        <p>She pressed her palm flat on my chest.</p>
        <p>
          Her touch charged warmth down my stomach, over to my cock. I wanted
          her to touch me. But not here...not here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were wide, bright with lust, growing seductive, but the
          second, embodied with a dark look that made her pupils dilate. I was
          one hundred percent positive I mirrored the desire on her face, but—
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hand ran down my chest, down to the hard ridges of my stomach. My
          muscles tensed against her purposeful exploration.
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed.</p>
        <p>"Leave Zahra,"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          Her hand glided up from my stomach to my chest in defiance as she
          brushed past my shoulders, and then I felt her fingers smooth past the
          side of my face before burying themselves inside my hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit back the hum of relief from her soft touch against my scalp.
        </p>
        <p>She was a few inches taller, courtesy of her pretty heels.</p>
        <p>
          She massaged gently, eyes searching between mine. "Let me kiss you."
          her voice at this moment should be compared to that of a siren song,
          compelling men to do her bidding.
        </p>
        <p><i>Control...control.</i></p>
        <p>"No," I said.</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze flickered to my lips as she pressed her body to mine. "But I
          want to."
        </p>
        <p>"And I want you to leave."</p>
        <p>
          "Do you?" she asked, her fingers tightening their hold on my hair, not
          too much, just enough to pull me down so that we breathed from the
          same oxygen space. "Do you really, Elio?"
        </p>
        <p>"Ye—yes."</p>
        <p>Her eyes narrowed in amusement. "You don't sound so sure."</p>
        <p>
          A strained noise rumbled from my chest, my control on the verge of
          slipping. "Why are you doing this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hold softened on my hair, other hand trailing up my arm with her
          index finger. "Because, Elio, I want nothing more but to see you lose
          yourself in pleasure."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>"I want to please you."</p>
        <p>Ah fuck—</p>
        <p>
          She leaned up, bringing her lips to the underside of my ear. I first
          felt the warm wetness of her tongue before her lips closed around my
          skin, sucking on a kiss that sent shock waves down to my hard length,
          still locked inside the strain of my briefs.
        </p>
        <p>I clenched my jaw hard.</p>
        <p>"You're so tense," she whispered.</p>
        <p>
          Her hand, which had been trailing up my arm, went back down as it
          disappeared between us. She rubbed against the bulge against my pants
          before bringing her gaze to mine, "Let me help you," Her fingers moved
          up to my belt in an attempt to undo it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held the left side of her hip, a move I made to push her away from
          my body, but I found myself pulling her closer.
        </p>
        <p>"No." I rasped.</p>
        <p>"Give in, Elio."</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          I let her undo my belt buckle, her eyes still on me as she said.
          "You're so hard; let me fix it."
        </p>
        <p>"You fucking caused it."</p>
        <p>
          "I merely touched you; you got hard because your body clearly needs
          the relief," she unzipped me, and I groaned closed-mouthed when she
          palmed me, her sinful eyes peered up at me. "A relief only I can
          give."
        </p>
        <p>
          She carefully rubbed me, and my forehead settled against hers, my
          breathing feverish. "You undo me, <i>Zahra</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          With hooded eyes and wet lips, she swallowed, "Exactly what I aim to
          do, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          My head filtered away the double meaning of her words, keeping it for
          later as I pulled back to look at her, the exact moment she looked at
          me.
        </p>
        <p>"Anybody could walk in," I said.</p>
        <p>
          "Even better. Imagine the governor walking in and getting a show of me
          sucking your cock?"
        </p>
        <p>
          That was supposed to turn me off, but I grew rock solid against her
          touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened. "Oh shit, you like that, don't you? The thought of
          getting caught?" she grinned. "You big whore."
        </p>
        <p>"You little slut."</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled softly, the sound bouncing inside my chest. "Now, now,
          slut shaming is bad."
        </p>
        <p>"So it's okay when you do it?"</p>
        <p>"Are you admitting you're a whore?"</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," I warned, my breathing mirrored the pace at which my heart
          worked. "We shouldn't—"
        </p>
        <p>"Come on, don't you fucking love the thrill?"</p>
        <p>
          Frustration stained my feelings red. "Fuck, Sport, this is unethical,
          it's risky, it's stupid—"
        </p>
        <p>Her hand left inside of my hair as she smirked. "Live a little."</p>
        <p>
          And then she pushed me lightly until my back was against the sink, and
          she was going down to her knees, separating the slit on her dress for
          easy settlement; then the little witch smiled up at me underneath her
          lashes.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond sinful.</p>
        <p>
          She looked back down, anticipation sizzling through me, but I still
          managed to catch the slight tremor in her fingers as she moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached down, putting a finger under her chin and lifting it so she
          could look at me.
        </p>
        <p>"You don't have to."</p>
        <p>
          "I want to." She gulped, shaking her head. "No, I'm <i>dying</i> to."
          She said, and I let her be.
        </p>
        <p>I felt her fingers on me, and then she let me out of my briefs.</p>
        <p>
          I watched her take in my size, her lips parting as she looked up at
          me. "How do you have a pretty face and a fucking—" She looked back
          down at me, and my breathing grew ragged as she held me. "Fuck me,
          you're—you're huge."
        </p>
        <p>"You don't have to voice it. I am not blind."</p>
        <p>
          I bit my tongue at the sensation of her soft palm trying to encircle
          me—it made the heat not enough, but at the same time, drove me to the
          edge.
        </p>
        <p>"Not too late to turn back," I told her.</p>
        <p>
          "You should know by now that I take everything as a challenge." She
          said breathily, the heat from her mouth bathing my hard length, and I
          wanted inside that mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd never longed for anything more than the wet heat her mouth would
          provide to my cock.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stroked me once, and then I caught her pink tongue strut out of
          her mouth, licking from the base of my length to the tip, which leaked
          out pre-cum.
        </p>
        <p>
          When was the last time I had relief or gratified myself sexually—I
          couldn't remember—but right now, I was a starved man, and I needed
          that relief she so wanted to give me.
        </p>
        <p>
          She locked her gaze with mine as she spread the pre-cum against my
          shaft, seeking easier friction, and then she licked me, taking her
          time, teasing me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind had shoved the thoughts of being caught to a place where it
          didn't bother me but made the act even more daring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her thumb finger brushed the slit at the head of my cock, and I
          groaned, my hand smoothing her hair from the side of her face as I
          held it at the back of her head. I didn't pull. 
        </p>
        <p>"Is this okay?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Anything you do is okay," she said</p>
        <p>"I—"</p>
        <p>
          She spat against the head of my cock, and her tongue and hand worked
          the lubrication around my shaft.
        </p>
        <p>Edging me.</p>
        <p>We don't fucking have time for foreplay. "Zah—"</p>
        <p>Her mouth covered me.</p>
        <p>
          For a second, I forgot to breathe. My chest stopped heaving until I
          felt her twirl her tongue around the head of my cock, and take me
          deeper into her mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          A soft, breathy groan rumbled from my chest, and I parted my lips,
          letting the sound out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was throbbing so hard inside the wetness and delicate tightness of
          her mouth, my head was filled with equally sinful thoughts, like how
          badly I wanted to grip her hair and take control, fucking her mouth
          like it was my personal property.
        </p>
        <p><i>Control. </i></p>
        <p>I grounded my teeth together, holding back. </p>
        <p>
          Zahra took me deeper, her tongue giving me equal attention as she
          moved her head, stroking, sucking, and licking at the same goddamn
          time.
        </p>
        <p>How the fuck is she so good—</p>
        <p>
          I felt her soft grip at my base, and she squeezed lightly, removing
          her mouth from my cock, and looking up at me from underneath her
          lashes, lips swollen, eyes glassy with lust as she said. "Fuck my
          mouth."
        </p>
        <p><i>Control...</i></p>
        <p>"Be careful what you ask for."</p>
        <p>"Do it." she shifted closer to me, eager. "Please."</p>
        <p>
          My grip tightened on her hair, and I tilted her head back to the angle
          I preferred. I moved my other hand, wrapping it around my length,
          stroking a few times while I angled the head against her lips.
        </p>
        <p>"Open up for me,"</p>
        <p>
          She moment she let her lips part, I slid into her mouth, filling it
          up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lost control. My crazed habit took over. There was no stopping this
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers buried themselves into her hair, and I gripped and pulled
          her head further back.
        </p>
        <p>And then, I fucked her mouth.</p>
        <p>
          Pumping in mercilessly, past the limit she had taken me before. I hit
          the back of her throat, still didn't bottom out, but the tightness
          hugging the head of my cock at her gag doubled my need for release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her choking and gurgling sound as I tamed her mouth swarmed straight
          to my head, causing chaos in my chest and bringing hastes to my
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck, Sport," I caught her eyes tearing up at the force with which I
          used her mouth.
        </p>
        <p>I was close. So, fucking close.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra held both my thighs to steady herself, and I wanted to savor
          this moment, tape it to my head and never let it leave, but I knew we
          still had to go out there, and I already made a mess of her hair.
        </p>
        <p><i>Oh fuck...</i></p>
        <p>
          I had to take back control but damn it to hell and under—her mouth
          felt so good wrapped around my cock.
        </p>
        <p>My need for release tightened to the edge.</p>
        <p>"Ah—" I breathed out. "Swallow?"</p>
        <p>
          She answered positively with a small throat sound, and I thrust into
          her mouth a few more times before my movements turned sloppy. One of
          her hands left my thigh as she wrapped her hand at my base; the short
          stroke she gave had my release spurting into her mouth and down her
          throat as she swallowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          My movement slowed, and I let her lick and suck the aftershocks out of
          me. I was still semi-hard and hated that we weren't in a more private
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to bathe her face with my cum, revel in the fucking sight,
          for sore eyes I knew she would be. But we couldn't be messy. Not here.
        </p>
        <p>I slipped out of her mouth, letting go of my hold on her hair.</p>
        <p>
          "I want more," she said, her tongue running over her glistening bottom
          lip as she watched me tuck myself into a decent form again.
        </p>
        <p>"Get up."</p>
        <p>
          She did, wiping the corners of her eyes as she squirmed on her feet,
          most definitely due to a possible discomfort between her legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips looked like I'd fucked the subtleness out of them, it was
          swollen, pink flushed, fucking kissable, and I wanted to do it, close
          the distance between us, taste my cum on her tongue—but I couldn't.
        </p>
        <p>I hated that I couldn't.</p>
        <p>So I pulled her by her waist, and her body fell against mine.</p>
        <p>
          The piercings from her nipples pressed against my shirt, and my tongue
          ached to lick them back to softness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised a hand to her hair, brushing the short length as I asked.
          "Did I hurt you?"
        </p>
        <p>"Not in a bad way," she said.</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. If I were to slip my hand under your panties, would I find you
          wet for me?"
        </p>
        <p>"Soaking." She whispered.</p>
        <p>My semi-hard-on grew harder against her stomach.</p>
        <p>"How do you want me to take care of you?"</p>
        <p>"Any way you please."</p>
        <p>I arranged her hair as it was when she entered the washroom.</p>
        <p>
          "You might not believe it," she said, and I dropped my gaze to hers.
          "But this was the first time I've let anyone man near my mouth since I
          was fifteen. Should in case my skills were—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You were perfect." I countered immediately because, yes, she was. I'd
          never been so undone to the point that it affected my breathing. "I
          thought you said your first time was 17?" I asked, even though I knew
          it had been a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked away from my face to my shoulder. "I lied." She spoke. "I
          was 14...my first time."
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand froze on her hair; she noticed and quickly added to her
          previous statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was nothing. I barely remember it." she shrugged, but I knew she
          did remember. Her lie was transparent.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm," I said in response.</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze met mine again. "So...this, no kissing thing. Can we just
          take it away?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "I never go back on my words or my affirmations." I dropped my hand
          from her hair, trailing the naked skin on her exposed thigh. Unable to
          keep my hands off.
        </p>
        <p>"But you do," she pointed out. "We just broke one of your rules."</p>
        <p>"Which you will pay for." My hand moved.</p>
        <p>
          A giddy look crossed her face. "Ooou, why do I like the sound of—" she
          gasped when my hand cupped the hot throbbing space between her legs,
          my touch intense and possessive because it was precisely how I felt.
        </p>
        <p>
          A glint of pride bloomed in my chest at how soaked and hot she was for
          me. I wanted nothing more but to make her pay for the interruption she
          had caused today, for the rules she had made me break.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as she had made me lose my damn mind a few minutes ago, I wanted
          her to lose hers too.
        </p>
        <p>
          She sucked in her bottom lip to stop the soft hiss that had been about
          to escape.
        </p>
        <p>"You don't know what you've signed up for, querida."</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes brightened as she released her lip. "I could say the same for
          you." she smiled. "As you said, we're alike in so many different ways.
          I want to unearth you as much as you want to do the same with me. It's
          what makes this fun."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You shouldn't hoodwink yourself by thinking there is anything
          <i>fun</i> about this. It is incommodious at best."
        </p>
        <p>"Incommo-what now?"</p>
        <p>
          I took my hand off her, settling both on her waist as I hesitantly
          pushed her away from me.
        </p>
        <p>"Inconvenient," I stated in much simpler terms.</p>
        <p>
          Grabbing my trench coat, I brushed past her toward the door and
          slipped it back on, turning to face her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And...he's back." She took my previous position, leaning against the
          sink as wide lustful eyes roamed my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eyed her. "I have a small house downtown. That's where we'll be
          settling tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes spoke dirty thoughts as she watched my fingers fasten two
          buttons in my trench coat.
        </p>
        <p>"Sport."</p>
        <p>"Yeah?" her gaze snapped to mine.</p>
        <p>"Did you hear what I said?"</p>
        <p>
          "Honestly, no. Your fingers are—distracting. Why are they
          distracting?"
        </p>
        <p><i>For the love of man, not her too.</i></p>
        <p>
          By habit, I shoved both hands into the pocket of the coat. "I said I
          have a small house downtown, and we'll settle there tonight."
        </p>
        <p>"Small house?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Angelo will be at his mother's, and by the morning, we'll be
          back on a flight to Milan." I informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully, an enclosed space housing the both of us would be enough to
          get in her head.
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, when you said small, I was thinking like a—smallish fancy house
          with black and white design and classy shit—" she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could see what she was seeing now; the small living room with three
          yellow couches, soft beige wallpaper, decorative flowers on the wall,
          bookshelves lining a small space by the far end of one of the couches,
          and a soft, comfortable rug that added a homely feel to the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was one kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom, and no passageways. The
          doors to the bathroom and bedroom were to our left, although the
          bathroom had another co-joined door inside the bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kitchen was visible from where we stood, a small cozy space with a
          brown marbled counter, one gas cooker, one oven, and one small fridge
          with picture stickers of my brother and sister, Elia, and my mom.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the pictures were cut out; a face was missing—my face.</p>
        <p>
          "The more I look at it, the more it feels...personal." Zahra voiced.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is," I told her, pulling off my coat and turning on more lights.
        </p>
        <p>The room was now bathed in white, brown, and yellow.</p>
        <p>
          I caught the look of discomfort in Zahra's eyes as she turned to look
          at me. "Elio, why did you bring me here? We could have gone to a hotel
          or something."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took off my wristwatch. "It would be illogical to spend money on
          hotels when I have a house here."
        </p>
        <p>"You're rich."</p>
        <p>"Yes, but I am not wasteful."</p>
        <p>
          "It's—" she paused, exasperated and jittery. "Elio, what do you think
          we're doing here?" she motioned between us.
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "What do you think this is? You can't bring me to your space...you
          shouldn't trust me so much."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't trust you."</p>
        <p>
          "Yet you bring me here. To this house that looks like your safe space.
          I'm pretty sure you've never brought anyone here, so what makes me an
          exception?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She was right. No one's been here but me. This house was a delusion. I
          didn't like flashy or extravagant things. I was born from wealth, but
          I wanted the most minor things that came with life.
        </p>
        <p>Well, for now...while I'm still inconveniently breathing.</p>
        <p>
          "I don't want anything to get mixed up or blurry, okay? This feels too
          personal." She spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think it's just a house. Why are you overthinking, hm? Is this
          stringing from guilt because you do not have pure intentions?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not guilt." She countered...<i>She lied.</i> "I'm just—I'm just
          not used to this. Maybe I'm overthinking it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Or maybe you need a shower and a change of clothes. And food, because
          you eat like a horse, and the dinner served today was sub-par."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm," a smile broke out on her face. "Look at you, knowing the right
          buttons to push."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          She laughed, walking around the space. "Are any of your soldiers
          around?"
        </p>
        <p>"Why? Do you aim to strangle me in my sleep?"</p>
        <p>
          She turned to me, a smile curving at her lips. "Don't give me ideas."
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra Faizan was a beautiful disaster. A cunning woman. An entity as
          discreet and suave as me.
        </p>
        <p>Her only mistake was her utter transparency.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll shower and wear your clothes while you order food. Or cook—can
          you cook?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know."</p>
        <p>"Ordering it is, then."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. The bathroom is the one on the left. Everything you require is
          easy to find. It's a small space. Nothing is hidden."
        </p>
        <p>"Roger that."</p>
        <p>
          I watched her walk towards the door I had pointed out and disappear
          behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes still on the door; I dipped my hand into my pocket, brought
          out my phone, and called Angelo's number.
        </p>
        <p>He picked on the first ring. <i>"Marino."</i></p>
        <p>"Did you find them?"</p>
        <p><i>"Yes." </i></p>
        <p>"And."</p>
        <p><i>"From Sicily. Martino Conti's men." </i></p>
        <p>
          "Martino Conti," I drawled. "Hm. Dig up all you can. Not about her;
          her information in the database is rubbish. But Conti. I want to know
          everything."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Noted. Are you being careful?" </i></p>
        <p>"Yes, I have condoms, papà."</p>
        <p>
          <i>"That's not—Jesus. I'm just saying be careful around her." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. Say hi to your mother and Lisa for me. Don't forget the prayer
          pamphlets; she would feel offended if I don't ask for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          His mom was religious, and each time Angelo visited, he always
          returned with pamphlets she had picked out for me. His mother, my
          mother, and his aunt, Lisa, had been close back in the day. But then
          my mother's case worsened, and she withdrew from everyone until...
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I'll do that," </i>Angelo's voice reached my ear. "<i
            >See you tomorrow."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I hung up.</p>
        <p>
          Earlier, I didn't care enough to look into Martino Conti. I was not
          one to meddle with the growing families. Let's say our level differed
          in rank. But his name had been mentioned one too many times, and his
          connection with Zahra evoked a gut feeling I couldn't ignore.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might not concern me, but it was happening right under my
          territory.
        </p>
        <p>And that...just won't do. <br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>ELIO MARINO </b>was wearing white.</p>
        <p>
          Although that wasn't the subject matter here, it was just one
          interesting fact. The man had been entirely unashamed, walking into
          the bedroom he knew I was in, wearing nothing but black boxer briefs
          with wet hair, which he towel-dried right in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body—fuck me sideways and back—He was rough, invisible scars
          covered by ink, taut muscles built from pure hard labor and,
          well—maybe the gym? But it really didn't look like gym muscles or sex
          muscles. From every rip in his arms to his defined as fuck stomach,
          there was something intricate about each flex as he moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that particular thing pushed me into a trance-like state, staring
          at him, at his defined back muscles when he turned to find new
          clothes. His broad back and shoulders flexed erotically as he moved to
          slip strong legs and thigh into black sweatpants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing that caught my attention was his tattoos. I had always
          been curious about where the ink flame led, but I found out today,
          and...
        </p>
        <p>It had me feeling wary.</p>
        <p>
          A well-detailed drawing of burning flames drove up his forearm and
          shoulders, over to his neck, and then half his chest. I caught
          something like a church tower and a crucifix sign above—at first, I
          didn't realize it, but then I noticed the fire was aflame in the
          church, and when he turned, my stomach dipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chinese he had ordered had threatened to come back out of my
          mouth; even the black raspberry I was currently munching on
          temporarily became unappetizing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the drawing of three faces amidst the flame. Hollow eyes wide
          with tears streaming down sunken cheeks, mouths wide open in a wail.
          The three faces seemed floating between the fire—a little boy, a young
          girl, and a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was so caught in it that I had to blink my thoughts back in order
          when he sleds an oversized white sweater on, covering the tattoos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then without looking my way, he had gone to the dresser, dried his
          hair a little bit, and then brushed it down. Seeing him in another
          color of clothing was—strange; it didn't seem like him, but I wouldn't
          lie and say that he didn't look good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I would have preferred him without anything. One reason was
          that he was pleasant to look at, and the other was because I wanted to
          study the ink on him. I felt like if I kept looking, I'd find
          something new to give me further insight into the story behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took my mind off him, glancing at the calm darkness outside the
          window in the room.
        </p>
        <p>Last I checked the time, it was almost 12:30 AM.</p>
        <p>
          Elio had been reading while I ate the food he had ordered for me, and
          when he decided to shower, I decided to retire into the room with a
          bowl of blackberries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted on the bed, leaning against the headboard, wearing a white
          shirt with writings on the front. I had found it folded in the
          dresser, amongst other mundane things that didn't scream the Elio
          Marino I had gotten used to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Underneath, I wore one of his boxer briefs, my legs on full display as
          I ate the black raspberry I had found in the fridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could tell someone had dropped by to clean up the place and stock it
          up, meaning he had spent time planning this whole thing, but I didn't
          comment. Commenting on it would make it seem real. It would make me
          acknowledge that he had put in effort...for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I backtracked as he walked towards the bed, phone in hand, before he
          pulled the duvet to one side, attempting to lie down.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed the last berry I had taken in, eying his movements as he
          settled beside me on the bed. "Uh...what are you doing?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He pushed the duvet further down with his legs. "What do people do on
          beds?"
        </p>
        <p>"They—"</p>
        <p>
          "Either sleep, fuck, or just relax. The last option is what I'm
          doing." He said, settling into the pillow, about to use his phone.
        </p>
        <p>"Won't you at least be a gentleman and take the couch?"</p>
        <p>
          He turned to look at me for the first time since he came out of that
          bathroom. "Why, in all consciousness of the mind, will I take the
          couch when there's a bed?" <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted the bowl of raspberries to myself. "Because
          <i>I'm on</i> the bed?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh..." he said, blinking at me while trailing off as if thinking
          deeply. "I have no problem sharing a bed with you. It is big enough to
          accommodate two people, but I understand if you have a problem sharing
          a bed. You can take the couch."
        </p>
        <p>
          My jaw dropped, and it turned into a small laugh. "I seriously don't
          understand you. Pick a side. Are you a gentleman or an asshole? Stop
          confusing me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He pursed his lips, eyes searching mine before he moved, raising
          himself to my level, elbow on his side, now facing me fully.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reached for a raspberry in the bowl, watching me while he put it
          into his mouth, tongue collecting it first before it disappeared
          inside his mouth and chewed delicately.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little thump made itself known between my legs, and I pressed them
          together and shifted as I looked from his lips to his eyes, quenching
          the thought of wanting to kiss him.
        </p>
        <p>Not like he would entertain it anyway.</p>
        <p>I suppressed the sting.</p>
        <p>
          "I am not an asshole. I am just very straightforward. The sooner you
          learn the difference between the two, the better." He said, dropping
          his phone in the tiny space between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why are you so comfortable sharing a bed with me?" I asked. "Aren't
          you wary I'd hurt you in your sleep?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          His shoulders moved. "I won't sleep. So it's useless worrying about a
          situation I can control."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered between his as I picked another raspberry, watching
          him while I chewed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man didn't take his eyes off me either, and I could tell there
          were questions within their depths.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I knew I needed to ask him questions before getting into
          character.
        </p>
        <p>"I thought you only wore black because you despise other colors?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He nodded. "When I'm in the compound, yes. Outside the compound,
          I do whatever I desire. I also like to collect items I'll never wear,
          like the shirt you're wearing. This sweater, though, was a birthday
          gift from Angelo's mother. I liked it. I kept it. Now I'm wearing it."
          he said, reaching for another berry.
        </p>
        <p>"When's your birthday?" I asked him, genuinely curious.</p>
        <p>"December 1st. When's yours?"</p>
        <p>
          I didn't think he'd ask, but then again, he had been behaving
          suspiciously since I got on that plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm surprised you don't know...since you're supposed to have run a
          background check on me."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm. We did run one, but now I'm asking. I want you to tell me."</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "It's January 3rd, according to certificates and documents
          I've seen; I don't know how true it is."
        </p>
        <p>He watched me.</p>
        <p>"What? Did you see a different date when you ran your check?"</p>
        <p>He shook his head. "No."</p>
        <p>
          I looked away from him to the bowl. It was quiet for about ten seconds
          before I broke it.
        </p>
        <p>"Can I ask a question?"</p>
        <p>
          "I thought we were already doing that," Elio responded, still watching
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He got more comfortable, shifting—closer to me, his chin on his palm
          as he looked at me, his gaze unnerving. The same one he had on the
          plane when he looked up for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>Like he was in awe.</p>
        <p>No one's ever looked at me like that.</p>
        <p>
          Whenever Martino looked at me, all I saw was controlled obsession,
          lust, care, and anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was also lust in Elio's stare, but that wasn't really what was
          shown. It was something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me like I was something shiny and new, something worth
          looking at. The awe in his eyes didn't exactly spell care, but it gave
          the definition of wonder and curiosity. Like he wanted to know me,
          sink into my head, and decipher my thoughts gradually.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me like I was the only thing in this room that could keep
          his attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those eyes, intense and beautiful, looked so soft right now. It made
          me want to confide in him, tell him every secret I'd kept hidden since
          I could make sense of this world. I knew he wouldn't judge; I knew he
          would listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I still held back. I was willing to give him my body and nothing
          else.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm listening, Sport; ask your question."</p>
        <p>
          The space was warm between us, and I could hear him breathing, just as
          I was sure he heard me.
        </p>
        <p>"I couldn't help but notice your tattoos. Are those your family?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes." He answered with no subtle blink to show he was lying, no
          hesitation, no hiding; he just blurted it like he was prepared for my
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your mom—I thought you stabbed her to death; why was she in the
          fire."
        </p>
        <p>"Because she was."</p>
        <p>I frowned. "I don't understand, didn't you—kill her?"</p>
        <p>He didn't respond; he just stared.</p>
        <p>
          I bit my bottom lip, rephrasing my statement and testing a theory I'd
          suspected about him. He never responded to assumptions. Only
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>"Did you stab your mother to death?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          I pressed more with another question. "Did she burn in that fire?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>I nodded. "Why did you set them on fire?"</p>
        <p>No response.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed, realizing I had assumed while asking the question—this man.
        </p>
        <p>"Did you do it? Did you kill your family?"</p>
        <p>
          He swallowed, eyes searching mine as the silence after I'd asked that
          question lengthened. I knew he wasn't taking his time because he was
          thinking of a lie. The look in those tormented eyes told me he
          wouldn't like to continue this topic of conversation. I was about to
          tell him it was okay until he spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I didn't kill my family." His voice sounded gruffer, deeper,
          rough.
        </p>
        <p>It sent a pang straight to my chest.</p>
        <p>"Then why don't you tell people the truth?"</p>
        <p>"No one has ever asked."</p>
        <p>
          I had the strongest urge to shift even closer to him. "So...why do you
          tell people that you did."
        </p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched and unclenched. "I have never told anyone I killed my
          family, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"Why does everyone think—"</p>
        <p>
          "My father. He created the narrative to protect his image and build
          mine, rumors turned to rumors, and I became—the monster who went wild
          after a year in the army and killed my family the day I got back just
          because I'd found out they weren't exactly my family. My mother had
          been a whore and a cheater who sold out family secrets. So, I burnt
          them all in a fit of rage, and I'll do it again to anyone who is a
          threat to our family name." he said.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't know what to say, so I let him continue.</p>
        <p>
          "A very embarrassing narrative, to be honest; my father was never
          creative. I could have come up with something better. Then again, it
          seemed to do the trick. I was named The Wicked and reigned in
          assumptions people make of me. I must admit that it is fun sometimes."
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed out, taking the bowl from between us before stretching to
          keep it on the bedside table. I shifted closer to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," I said softly, and he gave me his attention. "I think it's not
          too late to start changing the narrative."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "It is too late. The narrative is who I am. It
          might not be who I am now, right in this moment with you. But the
          minute I walk back into that compound. It's who I am."
        </p>
        <p>"But that's not fair. To yourself, or the memory of your family."</p>
        <p>
          Something softened in his eyes, his stare grew deeper, more
          meaningful, and I almost shrank into myself at all the emotions it
          carried and how he didn't make any move to hide them.
        </p>
        <p>"You believe me," he said, lowering his pitch.</p>
        <p>
          I lowered the pitch of my voice too, keeping our conversation locked
          between us and nowhere else in the room. "From one liar to another, I
          think it's pretty easy to spot our truths just as much as our lies,
          Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That might be the wisest thing you've ever said since I met you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I let a small laugh bubble out of my chest. "Come on, I have said wise
          things...a lot of them, actually."
        </p>
        <p>"Your sexual innuendos?"</p>
        <p>
          I shot him a deadpan stare, struggling not to smile. "Now you're the
          one bringing sex into the conversation."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm only stating facts."</p>
        <p>
          I smiled. "Well, what can I say? Sexual innuendos come with my whole
          package."
        </p>
        <p>He raised both his brows. "Oh, you're a package now."</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm-uhm. I know people who would kill to have me stand by their
          side." I said with a proud smile.
        </p>
        <p>He switched to Spanish. "With you offering them what?"</p>
        <p>
          I loved his accent when he spoke in the dialect. It rolled naturally
          and deeply off his tongue and throat. It was seductive, even though I
          was positive he didn't mean for it to be that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I responded in the dialect too. "Word of advice, strategic planning,
          ways on how to get information because it is the most valuable thing
          you could ever hold against your enemy."
        </p>
        <p>"Is that what you offered to Martino?"</p>
        <p>
          I knew he was going to ask, and I thought I knew the answer I would
          give, but looking at him now, I didn't know how to lie...so I just
          went with the first thing that came to mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It wasn't like that, at first...I was just living with him, helping
          with chores here and there because I'm all things but a freeloader."
        </p>
        <p>"Why were you living with him?"</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, looking away from his face. "I-I can't really remember
          much about those times, but...I think he saved me. Um—from some bad
          guy in the business, and he brought me to Sicily. I was 16. I thought
          I was finally free from the life I'd had, but—"
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't freedom." Elio pointed out, and I nodded.</p>
        <p>"It wasn't...it was worse."</p>
        <p>"Did he hurt you?"</p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my lip. "He didn't do anything that I didn't want.
          At least I thought I wanted it because I thought he—loved me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at him, expecting to find his eyes judging me, but there was
          nothing; he just listened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But he didn't love you," Elio spoke, gently urging me to divulge
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe he did...in his own weird way, but it was unhealthy. I was
          underage, and he was an adult—and I was stupid to think it was real
          from my end. Martino was obsessed at best. I started living when I
          left him."
        </p>
        <p>"When was that."</p>
        <p>"I was 18."</p>
        <p>"And he just let you go?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," I said, finally looking at him. "He woke up one morning, and
          since he'd taught me the business and all I know now, I had been with
          some of his soldiers, and he called me up to his study and told me
          that I was free to leave if I wanted to."
        </p>
        <p>"Did you want to?"</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "At that time, I didn't really know—it took me a month to
          make the decision to leave. I needed to find myself, you know. He
          didn't give me any money to fend for myself when I left, and I was
          stubborn as hell, so I just told myself that I would be able to do it,
          and well, here I am, in bed with the guy who kidnapped my family and
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio didn't say anything; he just stared, eyes deciphering, cutting
          down each of my words, looking for loose ends, anything that would
          signify a lie.
        </p>
        <p>"I have your anklet."</p>
        <p>I let out a subtle breath of relief.</p>
        <p>"Still?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. I thought you might want it back; it seemed like something
          special. My mother never really threw away important things; she
          always refers back to them any time she...momentarily forgets
          herself."
        </p>
        <p>"Did that happen often?"</p>
        <p>"It got worse a few weeks before I went to the army."</p>
        <p>"Why did you leave?"</p>
        <p>
          "My father. He forced it on me. I respected him too much to say no."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "Wait—is this by any chance the reason you left Devil?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "Yes. There would have been no one to take care of him when
          I left for the army. I couldn't trust anyone, not even Casmiro. So I
          had to send him away."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But it was only for a year, right? You could have reached out when
          you got back."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I wanted to. I went to Los Angeles a few months after I got back. I
          watched him from afar for a few days. He was happy, or he seemed happy
          and normal. I didn't want to ruin that. So, I left and watched him
          from afar ever since."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then tell him this; I'm sure he wouldn't hate you as much as he does
          now. Devil might be stubborn, but he's understanding, and deep down, I
          know he cares for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want him to. I can't be there for him. I can't promise to be
          when I know I might not live past 33."
        </p>
        <p>My frown deepened. "Don't fucking say things like that."</p>
        <p>"Does it upset you?"</p>
        <p>I shot him a look of disbelief. "Yes, it does."</p>
        <p>"Then I'll stop."</p>
        <p>"You'll stop thinking it too?"</p>
        <p>
          "I am afraid that is impossible. It's not something I can control."
        </p>
        <p>"Then seek—"</p>
        <p>
          I could tell he suppressed a groan. "I have repeatedly told you why I
          can't seek help. Repeating myself is not something I am fond of."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, fine, I'll drop it."</p>
        <p>"Thank you, Sport."</p>
        <p>
          "Why do you call me that?" I asked, the curiosity influencing the tone
          of my voice.
        </p>
        <p>His brows twitched, and his gaze dropped from mine.</p>
        <p>Silence fell between us.</p>
        <p>"Are you gonna answer or—"</p>
        <p>
          "You challenge me. You're sharp-mouthed; you don't fold easily; you
          keep me on my toes. You're just as stubborn as me. You're a little
          thing, yet a big force of nature. You're like my personal kind of
          sport. Except I don't like to play, I just derive pleasure from
          watching."
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the time he had kissed me, the little glitchy stutter attacked my
          chest to the point that my response was a simple, "Oh."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He hummed, eyes still on me, and I wanted to ask him why he was
          staring, but his phone screen lit up with a vibration and a text
          sound.
        </p>
        <p>My gaze flickered to it, but I couldn't see the texter.</p>
        <p>
          He looked down at his phone but didn't pick it up. He just brought his
          attention back to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So tell—" he stopped when his phone blared up again. Three times
          consecutively. He sighed and then picked it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him unlock the device. It was shielded from my view, but I
          watched how he typed back at whoever texted him.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned again.</p>
        <p><i>Was it Casmiro...</i></p>
        <p>The sound of him sending the text filled the space between us.</p>
        <p>
          It wasn't even up to a second before the sound of a response from the
          texter came up.
        </p>
        <p>He was typing out another reply.</p>
        <p>Elio's face gave nothing away, and it only fueled my curiosity.</p>
        <p>
          The back and forth continued for about a minute before he dropped the
          phone.
        </p>
        <p>"Cassie?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Angie?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Who was—"</p>
        <p>"I'm curious to know you, Zahra," he cut me off.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze went to the phone again, unable to detach my mind from how he
          had wholly stopped our conversation to text this person.
        </p>
        <p><i>If it was Cas...</i></p>
        <p>
          I could feel his eyes on me when he spoke again. "Tell me, what is it
          you desire?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The question had my gaze snapping to his, and I couldn't help but
          snicker. "Okay, Lucifer Morningstar."
        </p>
        <p>"What is a Lucifer Morningstar?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "He's a character from a show—like a TV—never mind." I couldn't deal
          with explaining it to him; I felt I'd spend hours doing that. "That,
          though, is a very dangerous question to ask a woman like me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think it's a pretty normal question. Do you plan to be a thief for
          the rest of your life, or is there something more that you want?"
        </p>
        <p>I parted my lips to answer the question, but nothing came.</p>
        <p>
          Elio waited patiently until I sighed and decided to be honest about
          myself for the first time tonight. "Honestly, I haven't thought that
          far yet. Maybe it's because I don't like to dwell on my future when I
          could just have it all in my present."
        </p>
        <p>"That's careless thinking."</p>
        <p>"I never said I was careful." I curled the side of my lips.</p>
        <p>
          A small scoff left him as he raised his hand to my hair, and I
          stiffened. He stroked gently before tucking it behind my ear; the warm
          tip of his fingers brushed the skin at the back of my ear and down my
          neck. I couldn't hide my visible shiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your actions show how very careless you are, Sport; you don't have to
          say it in words that you're not." He said, his voice lower than
          before, gaze dropping to my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          God...I wanted him to break that one rule, close the space between us
          and just...do it.
        </p>
        <p>Why the fuck am I waiting for him to do it?</p>
        <p>Fuck this.</p>
        <p>
          My palm rested flat on his chest, and I was genuinely surprised to
          feel how fast and hard his heart thumped.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed him flat and settled atop him in a straddle. He didn't stop
          me when I brought my head to his neck, breathing him in as I kissed
          his hot skin.
        </p>
        <p>His hands came to hold my waist in a firm grip.</p>
        <p>
          I kissed from his neck to his chin, then up to the corner of his lips,
          before I pulled away slightly, connecting my gaze with his. His hot
          breath fanning my face, eyes showing how completely resigned he was to
          this situation.
        </p>
        <p>He would let me kiss him. I know it.</p>
        <p>"I want to break a rule, Elio. I know you want it too."</p>
        <p>
          "I do," he said, swallowing while his heart hammered against my palm.
          "But I can't." his whisper brushed against my lips.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, I know. It's a good thing that I can, then."</p>
        <p>
          Without thinking about what he'd do next, I leaned in to satisfy that
          ache in my chest and the desire to feel the warmth from a kiss and—
        </p>
        <p>
          His phone blared up in a ring before I could even press my lips to
          his.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you fucking kidding me," I muttered through clenched teeth.
          "Don't answer—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He was already reaching for the phone, bringing it to his view while I
          got off him with a glare.
        </p>
        <p>"Who the hell is it?"</p>
        <p>"Angelo." He said, watching the phone ring.</p>
        <p>I rolled my eyes. "Why am I not surprised."</p>
        <p>
          "It's almost 3 AM. He wouldn't be calling me if it wasn't important."
          He said, sitting up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoa—did we talk that long into the night? It didn't even seem like an
          hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio picked up, placing the phone against his ear. "It better be
          important." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't hear what Angelo was saying, but it sure as hell made Elio
          tense up. However, his face gave nothing away.
        </p>
        <p>"How." He stated in question to Angelo.</p>
        <p>Angelo's response came, and it made Elio completely stiffen.</p>
        <p>"Is he okay?" he asked.</p>
        <p>I bit the inside of my tongue.</p>
        <p>
          Elio shifted away from me, getting off the bed. "When the fuck did
          this happen?" he said, moving to the dresser while I sat there...just
          watching.
        </p>
        <p>"Share the location; I'll be there."</p>
        <p>
          Then he hung up, dropped the phone on the flat surface of the dresser,
          and took off the white sweater hurriedly before quickly fishing out a
          black one.
        </p>
        <p>I got off the bed. "What happened?"</p>
        <p>
          Elio slipped on the sweater, turning to face me with a frown. "Casmiro
          was shot."
        </p>
        <p>"What? When?" I asked, putting on a concerned frown.</p>
        <p>
          "About thirty minutes ago. He's here in Turin." His phone vibrated on
          the table, and he picked it up from the surface, glancing at the
          screen, and then he started heading toward the door. "Angelo just
          shared the location to where they are—"
        </p>
        <p>"Let me come with."</p>
        <p>
          He paused, turning to look at me. I spotted the hesitation in his
          stare.
        </p>
        <p>"I won't get in your way. I just—don't want to be here alone."</p>
        <p>
          His gaze scanned and took me in from toe to head before he spoke.
          "Change."
        </p>
        <p>"On it."</p>
        <p>"I'll wait outside, do not take your time."</p>
        <p>
          "Got it." I was already heading to the dresser when he left the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found another black sweater identical to the one Elio had put on,
          and I tried to find sweatpants that would fit, but they were all so
          long and large, so I checked the dresser I'd found that white shirt,
          having seen a faded jean there while I was snooping earlier. It wasn't
          Elio's size, which meant it had been one of the things he collected
          from places he visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          I slipped that on and found a belt which I tightened around my waist.
        </p>
        <p>I grabbed my phone and left the room.</p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, Elio and I were driving to the location.

        <p>Hi! Thank you for your engagement in the last chapter!</p>
        <p>
          This update was supposed to come on Saturday, but I faced a massive
          burn-out that had me really scared, so I stayed away from my laptop
          and my phone a little bit. SPAM ME WITH COMMENTS TO MAKE ME FEEL
          BETTER, HEHE!
        </p>
        <p>Oh, and I hope you enjoy the update ;)</p>
        <p>_______<br /></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>HE WASN'T </b>taken to a hospital, but one of the Marino safe
          houses in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          This safe house was a penthouse in a hotel near Elio's building, and
          all through the ride here, he hadn't said a word; the man had been
          deep in silence, buried in his own thoughts. I wanted to assure him
          that all would be well. I have no idea why I felt the need to talk him
          out of his head; I didn't give a shit about Casmiro...But I cared
          about Elio, so I guess that's why.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we entered the elevator, I glanced at him, noticing his tense
          shoulders; his face was etched in a frown that made him look
          unapproachable. He was worried, and even his strong front couldn't
          hide it.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm sure he's fine since he wasn't hospitalized?"</p>
        <p>"Our medic team is here."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh." I voiced as the elevator rode up, the silence tense and
          deafening. "What was he doing here in Turin, anyway?"
        </p>
        <p>"Business."</p>
        <p>"Then why didn't he come with us earlier on the pla—"</p>
        <p>"I'm not in the mood to talk, Zahra." he snapped.</p>
        <p>
          I parted my lips to say something but closed them again, shifting on
          my feet as I looked ahead, grateful that the elevator stopped and slid
          apart, revealing a large living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio walked out quickly, and I followed behind him, but my steps
          faltered for a second when I spotted Upper and Angelo talking with
          some soldiers by the side; two nurses were checking a file at the far
          end of the living room. And soldiers were all around the space; there
          was also a table filled with weapons as if they were preparing to head
          out once information about the shooters came forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where is he?" Elio's voice boomed as we approached Upper and Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real fear gripped me when my eyes scanned Upper from head to toe, and
          even when I confirmed that he was okay and the blood on him wasn't
          his, the fear remained.
        </p>
        <p><i>He could have died tonight. </i></p>
        <p>"In there," Angelo said. "It's not looking good."</p>
        <p>
          Elio didn't wait to hear anything else, he just disappeared behind the
          door Angelo had pointed, and when Angelo followed him, not before
          shooting me a distrusting frown, I pulled Upper by his wrists, away
          from the other soldiers who kept their eyes on us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck are you doing here?" I said in a small voice, almost a
          whisper.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Glad to see that's the first thing you care about." He was frowning.
        </p>
        <p>"What? You—where's everyone else?"</p>
        <p>
          "Back in Milan, at the compound, I just informed them about what hap—"
        </p>
        <p>"Why are you here?" I bit at him.</p>
        <p>
          Upper looked tired. There were fading blood stains on his hands and
          some smudges here and there on his face; his hair looked a mess. "We
          were together when we got attacked by some really fucking trained
          people who knew how to use a bloody gun. Casmiro took three bullets,
          and we barely escaped that building alive."
        </p>
        <p>I eyed him. "Why were you <i>with</i> <i>him?</i> "</p>
        <p>
          Upper eyed me cautiously. "He invited me to come along? When he got
          back from the airport, we went for a drive, and I was still in the car
          when he told me he had a company here that dealt with racing and car
          shit—he asked if I'd like to tag along, and I did—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you didn't think to tell me you were <i>tagging</i> along?" I
          gritted out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It slipped my mind, okay? I figured I would surprise you, and you
          wouldn't get to be alone on the flight back—but fuck, that isn't
          important. These people stormed the company un-bloody-announced, and
          he got shot, and there was so much blood, and I freaked out because
          they were gunning for him, Zahra, they wanted to kill him. Not me. Or
          anyone else in that building."
        </p>
        <p><i>I was furious. </i></p>
        <p>
          "I don't give a shit about, Casmiro, Upper. You made a fucking mistake
          tonight, not telling me you would be here; you could have fucking died
          just by being with him. You don't <i>tag </i>along with people like
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper's eyes widened in disbelief, looking at me like my face belonged
          to a stranger. "What in bloody hell's name is wrong with you, Zahra?
          Do you not get it? He might die, and you're here worrying about the
          measly fact that I didn't shoot you a quick text?"
        </p>
        <p>"Upper—"</p>
        <p>
          "He took a bloody bullet for me, and he's in there fighting for his
          life because of it; you should be worried about <i>him</i>, not me.
          I'm fine; he's not. And he's not a fucking bad person, okay? Just
          because he's in a crime family doesn't mean we automatically wish him
          dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I get what you're saying, and I'm glad he took that bullet for you—"
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You would have died otherwise; spare me if I care about you and not
          someone I know absolutely nothing about."
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ, Zahra, at least show some sympathy."</p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, relaxing my shoulders as I looked toward the window. "I
          have no sympathy to give. Not even a tiny drop of care. He probably
          pissed off some people, made threats here and there, and talked more
          than he should; that's what these guys do; they run their mouths
          because they think they have a title that makes them untouchable. But
          Karma is a bitch, not our problem."
        </p>
        <p>Upper shook his head. "Are you high right now?"</p>
        <p>"Completely sober. How many were they, the men."</p>
        <p>
          Still frowning at me, he crossed his arms over his chest. "I couldn't
          exactly count. We were being chased around the building, and I
          practically dragged him to a car where I drove and informed Angelo."
        </p>
        <p>My brain worked. "They didn't follow?"</p>
        <p>
          Concern filled his eyes. "No, they didn't...it worries me that they
          didn't because they were hell-bent on making sure they empty their
          bullets on him. Whoever sent them must be influential because...what
          are you doing?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I rushed to the window, quickly pulling the curtain aside as I looked
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three cars were pulling up, all tinted windows. Armed men started
          filling out, and people rushed in different directions, evading the
          unknown gunmen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed the curtain and turned. "They followed. They just waited to
          make sure there was no room for escape."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper's eyes widened as he rushed towards me, pulling the curtain.
        </p>
        <p>"Bloody fuck."</p>
        <p>"We need to secure the building," I spoke. "Or we're all dead."</p>
        <p>
          The door Elio and Angelo had walked into pulled open, and Angelo
          stepped out. "Secure the building, shoot to kill on sight. Leave one
          person for questioning."
        </p>
        <p>Soldiers moved, taking silently on comms, grabbing weapons.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey," I whispered to Upper. "Stay here; on no account should you
          leave this apartment."
        </p>
        <p>"Where are you going?" he asked, confused.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't answer as I moved to the weapons table, Upper on my tail as I
          grabbed a handy gun. The weight was perfect on my grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, I don't think this is a good idea; these people, they know how
          to work a gun—"
        </p>
        <p>"Awesome, I happen to be perfect at working a gun too."</p>
        <p>
          He shot me a strange look as I clocked the weapon expertly before
          slipping the gun into the back of my jeans. "Listen, I know you're
          confused, but there's no time for me to explain why and how I know how
          to work a gun—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's not it. Ever since you arrived, you've been a completely
          different person."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm in men's clothing; what the fuck do you expect."</p>
        <p>"That's not—"</p>
        <p>
          "Upper, stay here, with Elio and Cas and the doctors, and I will—"
        </p>
        <p>"Do nothing." Elio's voice had my head snapping to the side.</p>
        <p>
          He reached us, his face void of emotion, attention settling on Upper.
          "I will never be able to repay you for saving Casmiro's life. I owe
          you."
        </p>
        <p>Upper nodded. "It's alright; he saved mine too."</p>
        <p>
          Elio gave a firm nod before looking at me. "You will banish whatever
          thought you think you have at this instant; you are not getting in
          that elevator."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm of no use here. I can help out there."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes hardened. "I don't need help; I have enough people to handle
          this."
        </p>
        <p><i>Goddamn, it. </i></p>
        <p>
          I drew my brows down in a frown, leveling Elio with a glare. "Upper
          would have died today. Understand? Those fuckers invading this
          building would have touched one of my own. I want nothing more than to
          bring down the people responsible for that and—"
        </p>
        <p>"Upper, can you give us a moment?" Elio spoke, cutting me off.</p>
        <p>
          Upper's eyes narrowed between us, confusion and suspicion lacing his
          accessing stare. His gaze dropped to our chests like he was looking at
          our outfits before he blinked and shook his head, settling his
          attention on me, seeking my approval.
        </p>
        <p>"It's fine," I said.</p>
        <p>
          He nodded before hesitantly walking over to Angelo, who was on the
          phone.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the soldiers were already filing into the elevator.</p>
        <p>
          I felt Elio's hand on my arm as he gently turned my body to face him.
        </p>
        <p>Our gazes locked. "I have to be out there, Elio."</p>
        <p>"You sound desperate."</p>
        <p>
          I couldn't have stopped the cut that tugged at my chest at his remark.
          "What?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked around the room, conflict in his eyes, before he looked back
          at me. "Why do you want to be out there so badly?"
        </p>
        <p>"To help?"</p>
        <p>"You don't care about any of this or Casmiro."</p>
        <p>"I care about Upper, and he almost died."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, but he's alive, and he's fine, so why do you want to get
          involved in a fight that isn't yours?" his eyes searched mine with
          confident suspicion. My stomach dipped, and I bit the inside of my
          lips till I tasted blood. My brain was working so fast.
        </p>
        <p>"I just—"</p>
        <p>"Unless it's your fight...."</p>
        <p>Another cut. "What?"</p>
        <p>"Unless, one way or another, this is your fault."</p>
        <p>"What the fuck are you talking about?"</p>
        <p>"Be honest with me Zah—"</p>
        <p>
          "You think I'm responsible for this?" I cut him off. "Are you fucking
          kidding me, Elio?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes briefly, jaw clenching as he opened them back up.
          "I won't make an accusation if I had no reason to, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"How—when the—why would I want to hurt Casmiro?"</p>
        <p>"<i>That</i> is what I am hoping you would answer for me."</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head slowly. "This is insane, so because I want to help,
          you think that I am involved in this? That I would put Upper in danger
          just to—Kill your underboss? How the fuck do you think I would have
          access to men like that? Or-or—kill someone I know nothing about; why
          would you even have a thought like this?"
        </p>
        <p>He looked as uncomfortable as I felt.</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, you have given me no reason to trust you but more reason to
          suspect everything you do."
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was leaving my lungs. "I can't believe this is happening right
          now."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is. You were so desperate to go out there. Your friend might not
          see it, but I see it. I see all your lies and all your tells. Every
          question I asked you tonight, <i>every</i>response you gave was
          <i>fucking bullshit</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What?" His words slapped me across the face, making me step back at
          their sheer bluntness. "They were not."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe they aren't, but you weren't completely honest with me," he
          stated confidently. "I went bare for you today," he lowered his voice,
          looking me right in the eye. "I told you things I never thought I
          would ever tell anyone; I confided in you and took your advice; I have
          shown you more of myself than I have ever shown anyone. I don't trust
          you, but I trusted you with my feelings; all I'm asking...is that you
          be honest with me for once tonight. Do you have anything to do with
          Casmiro lying in that room on the brink of death?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A small, humorless laugh left my throat. "Wow..." I said, almost out
          of breath. "The first time I actually open up to someone about
          Martino, and this is what I get—an absurd accusation."
        </p>
        <p>"Don't do that. Don't try to make me doubt myself."</p>
        <p>
          My frown deepened. "You should doubt yourself because your claims are
          beyond wrong."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          I stepped closer to him, my eyes dead set on his. "You say I wasn't
          completely honest with you. Yes, I wasn't. That part of my life is
          hard for me to talk about, and I opened up to you about something I
          have spent years of my life trying to forget."
        </p>
        <p>His brows drew down in confusion.</p>
        <p>
          "STREET has no fucking idea about Martino. I don't even plan to ever
          let them know, but you—just like you showed me a part of yourself, I
          did too. Because I thought maybe as we got to know each other, I might
          finally have someone I could talk to about this stuff."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, I know you weren't sincere."</p>
        <p>
          "Of course, I wasn't sincere; you don't expect me to bring down my
          walls completely just because you told me you didn't kill your
          family."
        </p>
        <p>He frowned. "Don't bring my family into this."</p>
        <p>
          "You are the one accusing me of attempting to kill Cas, he might be an
          asshole, and yes, I might have wanted to push him out of the car on
          our way to the airport, but I would never just wake up one morning and
          hire assassins to finish him off."
        </p>
        <p>He sighed. "Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know what you think you see, but remember, you were the one
          who invited me here. I don't know anyone in Turin, but you and I
          didn't even know Casmiro would be here. Upper never told me shit; you
          can ask him if that's what you're thinking. I don't know who those men
          are."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away from me, eyes moving around; I mirrored his action to
          see some sights on us, including Uppers. There was a frown etched on
          his brows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away at the same time Elio's gaze locked with mine. "I am
          giving you one pass, Zahra. Come clean, and I promise I won't hurt
          you. I won't let anyone harm a hair on your head. I need to know—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus fucking Christ, Elio, you were with me throughout—I can't even
          believe you're falsely accusing me without any proof—"
        </p>
        <p>"My gut is all the proof I need."</p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him. "You're pinning this on me because of a gut
          feeling?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          I locked my jaw, a breathy scoff leaving my chest as I stepped back
          from him. "Well, you're wrong. You couldn't even be more wrong—and we
          don't have time for this. I'm going down there."
        </p>
        <p>He straightened. "No, you're not. For your protection."</p>
        <p>
          "You know more than anyone here that I can fend for myself. And maybe
          when I shoot a man or two, you will be convinced I have nothing to do
          with this." I turned to leave, but he grabbed my arm almost
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          A ground-shaking explosion shocked the building, and screams and loud
          gunshots quickly followed the sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at him, my gaze flickering to his grip on my arm and
          then his heated eyes. "Are you gonna let me go? or are we waiting for
          the next explosion to take us all under?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio cursed, letting go of me, grabbing a weapon from the table, and
          gesturing to the elevator. "Stay by my side always."
        </p>
        <p>"Why? So you can see if I'm giving the shooters eye signals?"</p>
        <p>"We'll talk about this later."</p>
        <p>"Fuck you."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>I had something to prove.</p>
        <p>So I didn't exactly <i>stay by his side, always.</i></p>
        <p>
          At first, we were a little outnumbered. But backups had rushed into
          the evacuated building, and Angelo had pulled Elio to some of the new
          soldiers who were now working towards securing the perimeters of the
          building.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the little distraction, I'd taken that opportunity to chase down
          two of the shooters I'd spotted taking the stairs to get to the
          emergency elevator, seeing as Marino's people secured the main
          elevator.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was foolish to disappear alone with these guys scattered around the
          building.
        </p>
        <p>But I saw an opportunity to end this, and I took it.</p>
        <p>
          I spotted both guys coming off the stairs and approaching the
          elevator. Their backs to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had an advantage because while the guns outstretched in their hands
          moved this way and that as if someone would pop out and jump them, I
          held a gun in each hand, aiming one barrel to the calf of the guy on
          the left, and pointed the other to the top shoulder of the guy on the
          right, I calculated my next moves in my head. Then I pulled the
          triggers as I ran towards them, my feet slamming into the calf of the
          guy on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went down immediately with a loud grunt, turning sharply to shoot
          at the same time the other one collected himself, holding his wounded
          shoulder as he snapped back, aiming the gun at me, but I already had
          my gun aimed at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shot the same time I pulled the trigger, but I had anticipated his
          move and ducked as my bullet rammed into his hand, his gun falling the
          moment my feet swung, knocking the gun from the guy whose calf I had
          shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all happened in an adrenaline rush as I quickly kicked the guns far
          away from their reach, standing where I could face them, my weapons
          aimed directly at them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one whose hand I'd shot bared his teeth in a groan, about to
          charge forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would hold off if I were you." I kept my guns aimed at them,
          looking up around the top corners of the hallway and then back at
          them. They made no further move to attack. "Who sent you?"
        </p>
        <p>They were alert, faces hard in pain.</p>
        <p>
          "We are not here for you." one of them said with a thick Italian
          accent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Obviously, but you almost killed my friend, so here's how we're going
          to do it." my grip tightened on the gun. "I will kill one of you and
          hand the other to Marino's people. Who is willing to die? Discuss
          amongst yourself; make it snappy."
        </p>
        <p>"Go to hell," The one whose shoulder I had shot spat at me.</p>
        <p>"Nice choice."</p>
        <p>
          I moved my hand, aimed my gun at the guy I had shot in the calf, and
          pulled the trigger.
        </p>
        <p>His body dropped to the ground as footsteps rushed up the stairs.</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra!" Elio's voice rang into the space, and he appeared seconds
          after with men who had their guns ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          He rushed to me. "What part of staying by my side, don't you fucking
          understand?" he gritted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I brought you your man for questioning; you can ask him if he's seen
          me before."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right, because you didn't spend enough time disarming and killing one
          of them. Many words could have been exchanged."
        </p>
        <p>My heart dropped. "Are you—"</p>
        <p>
          "Shut up." He said before turning to his men. "Clean this up," he
          ordered before gesturing to the other man. "Take this one in. Inform
          Angelo that I'll contact him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio took the guns from me, handing them to one of his guys, and then
          he grabbed my hand and pulled me back down the stairs with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let go of me." I tried to wrench my hand off his hold, but he held
          firm as he pulled me out of the building and towards the parking lot
          where he had left the car earlier.
        </p>
        <p>He opened the door and finally let go of me. "Get in."</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Get the fuck in the car, Zahra, or I'll force you into it."</p>
        <p>
          I grounded my teeth, glaring at his unwavering stare. I knew he would
          do it, so I got into the car and bottled my pride with a huff.
        </p>
        <p>
          He slammed the door beside me and rounded the car. My eyes followed
          his movements as he entered; he looked at me while he started the
          engine and then looked away when he drove out of the parking lot to
          the private road thirty minutes away from the main road, I'm guessing
          to avoid any of our lingering attackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked out the window, the anger in my stomach spiking at intervals.
          The frown I had worn before entering the car didn't let up. I needed
          to let it out, yell, bash his head against the steering wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I shouldn't have told you anything about myself. If I'd known, you'd
          treat me like this afterward."
        </p>
        <p>"Don't play the victim."</p>
        <p>
          I snapped my head to him. "I <i>am</i> the victim! I'm the one getting
          accused of attempting to kill your underboss. If anything, he was the
          one who threatened to kill me before dropping me at that airport."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Casmiro would never threaten you unless he had a good reason to. You
          knew he was on to you, so you ordered the hit."
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />"What the fuck? You're delusional, Elio—for someone who should
          be running a whole fucking criminal family, you are so fucking
          shortsighted."
        </p>
        <p>"Am I?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Now I see why your father sent you to the army; you needed to
          get your fucking crazy head in check."
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at me, a fire in his eyes like none I'd ever seen before.
          He looked away, swiveled the car to the side of the private road,
          stopped the engine, and turned to me. "What the fuck did you just say
          to me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shoved my middle finger in his face and quickly exited the car,
          slamming the door harder than he had slammed it before as I walked
          down the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would get a ride to the airport and fly back to Milan if I had to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seconds later, I heard the door of the car opening and closing, but I
          didn't turn back, even as I heard footsteps behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He caught up quickly, a strong hand encircling my arm, pulling me back
          and swinging me around to face him. "Where the fuck do you think
          you're going?"
        </p>
        <p>"If you don't let me go, I swear to God; I'll hit you."</p>
        <p>
          He didn't respond to my threat but dragged me back, and I tried to
          free my hand. "I'm warning you, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>When he got us back in front of the car, he let me go.</p>
        <p>"You don't—"</p>
        <p>
          I swung a blow at him, but he quickly shifted his head, catching my
          wrist and pushing me away like a bug in his face.
        </p>
        <p>The action only made me more furious, and I charged for</p>
        <p>
          him, hoping to land a kick to his stomach, a blow, or a slap, but
          fucking hell, he wasn't playing either; he avoided every one of my
          attempts with hard pushes that resulted in only fueling my anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my last attempt to get my fist to the side of his face, he grabbed
          my wrist, pulled me to his body, and twirled us around forcefully,
          slamming my body to the side of the car.
        </p>
        <p>A sharp pain exploded at my side, but my adrenaline dulled it.</p>
        <p>
          He pinned me with his body, one knee between my legs, the other
          successfully caging us.
        </p>
        <p>My breathing was just as ragged as his.</p>
        <p>My gaze flickered to his parted lips, where he breathed from.</p>
        <p>"Get off me or I'll—"</p>
        <p>
          "Or you'll what?" He brought his face closer to mine, drawing his knee
          up till I felt it against my throbbing core. The friction made my hips
          jerk forward.
        </p>
        <p>I hated the small sound that left my lips at that very moment.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to gut him; I really wanted to make him bleed, but why the
          fuck was I so turned on instead?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why could I feel his hardness pressing against my stomach like this
          was as painful for him as it was for me?
        </p>
        <p>"Tell me, what will you do?" he whispered against my lips.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll—" fuck me, I couldn't remember how to form words, or—I did
          remember how to form words, just not the one my anger or brain wanted
          to say, my body and the desire wracking havoc between my legs were the
          demons behind the words that left my mouth next. "I need you." I
          gripped the front of his sweater in my fist. "Now. Please."
        </p>
        <p>
          A strangled noise left his throat. "I hate your effect on me; I want
          to kill you for it."
        </p>
        <p>"Unfortunately, we are both suffering from the same illness."</p>
        <p>
          His heated grey eyes burned fiercely into mine, and he pulled back. I
          missed the pressure his knee supplied between my legs until he opened
          the car's back door. "Get in."
        </p>
        <p>
          Excitement and anger sizzled through me as I rushed to the backseat,
          and he followed closely behind before slamming the door shut beside
          him. "Take off—just take off—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't have to tell me twice; I was already unbuckling my belt with
          fast shaky anticipating fingers. I removed it when he removed his
          sweatpants but left his shirt on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like the hindrance of clothes, so my sweater came off next
          when I took my jeans and panties off. I wasn't wearing anything
          underneath, so my breast sprang free, and his eyes were glued to them.
        </p>
        <p>"On me." he breathed.</p>
        <p>
          A smirk curled at my lips as I wasted no time getting on his lap, his
          back to the door, with me straddling his lap, bare breasts in his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          He buried his head in my neck, hand going into the depth of my hair,
          fisting as he sucked kisses down my neck while I rubbed my throbbing
          pussy against him.
        </p>
        <p>Feverish hot lips peppered kisses down to my collarbone.</p>
        <p>
          His other hand squeezed my ass before his palm drew up my back; the
          warmth from the smoothness of his touch set my body ablaze. My stomach
          tightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could tell he felt some of my scars, and his touch, though they
          lingered to feel and explore, didn't stop his lips from moving down to
          my left breast. My nipples hardened, ached, and tingled as his tongue
          flickered up and down the pierced bud before his mouth closed around
          one pierced nipple.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, my fuck," I breathed out in a moan; the heat from his mouth and
          the wetness of his tongue twirling and sucking my nipple had my legs
          squeezing against both sides of his thigh. The sensation was
          mind-numbing. I breathed out the words that left me. "I don't like
          condoms; I'm clean and on strict pills. Are you clean?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes," he mumbled before returning to his licking and sucking.</p>
        <p>"Fuck me, please," I begged.</p>
        <p>He took his mouth off me. "Your begging is pathetic."</p>
        <p>
          My own hand went to his hair and pulled so I could look into those
          pretty eyes. "Revel in it now because you won't hear me beg for it
          again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Lies, like the rest you've been telling tonight." He lifted himself
          and pulled down his briefs a little, his hard cock springing free,
          long, thick, and fucking veiny; the thought of him inside me scared
          and excited me at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>"You don't know what the fuck you're talking about."</p>
        <p>
          I went to touch him, but he swatted my hand away while his went
          between my legs, rubbing me as if to gather my wetness and coat his
          fingers with them; but his hot, warm touch sent my stomach tightening
          immediately, my clit throbbed like it needed just one stroke to let
          go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio removed his fingers and brought them to his lips; a very pink
          tongue came out, curling around his fingers as he licked my wetness,
          closed his eyes, and hummed in appreciation. "Hm, exotic."
        </p>
        <p>Yes. I will never get this man out of my system.</p>
        <p>"Better than any you've tasted?"</p>
        <p>
          "You're my first. I don't like a mess, but I'll take yours any day."
        </p>
        <p>My breath hitched at his words.</p>
        <p>
          His hand left my hair and gripped my waist, lifting me slightly. "You
          see that? That was me being honest. You might want to learn a lesson
          or two from it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the thousandth fucking time," I supplied breathlessly, feeling
          the tip of his cock at my entrance. "I am not lying to you."
        </p>
        <p>He glared. "My gut tells me you are."</p>
        <p>
          My grip tightened on his hair as I gritted out. "Your gut is fucked in
          the head, and it's making your inhumane lie detector malfunahfuck!"
          The feel of his thrust made me scream my lungs out at the pain and the
          pleasure that followed. He hit my G-spot on impact, and a blinding
          pleasure spiked deep within me; my eyes rolled back to my head as a
          wave of orgasm fevered through my body. I writhed atop him, toes
          curling.
        </p>
        <p>
          My walls hugged him tightly, and he let out a breathy moan-groan
          thing; I wasn't sure I heard correctly because he steadied my body,
          pulling out and thrusting deep again, hitting me where I most craved
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My body had turned to the softest of jelly atop him, and my palm
          slapped against the window above his head to get a balance on myself
          as he fucked me into a mess of moans, my breasts bouncing at the force
          of his malicious fucking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of his thrusts sent shuddering shivers that had me writhing—it
          was too much—he was too much, and I was so fucking full I couldn't
          breathe properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't care that I was probably gripping his hair so tight; the
          sound of his hips slapping against my ass with each thrust he gave had
          me on the brink of another sweet release. It filled the hot car, our
          breathing loud and so fucking intimate. Deep in my chest, I felt the
          effect of each breath I took and released.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Everything you said tonight told me—nothing," he said between
          breaths.
        </p>
        <p>This man went even deeper with each thrust.</p>
        <p>"Fuck—" I hissed. "No matter what I say—you'd never believe me."</p>
        <p>
          "Then give me something." He grounded out, voice heavy with lust and
          pleasure. "Anything." He breathed. "Anything to ease my doubt. Just
          one truth."
        </p>
        <p>"Mmm—Elio—fuck," I whined in a moan.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't let up, didn't slow down, his grunts so deep and hot did
          something enrapturing to my stomach; I wanted to hear it all day,
          every fucking day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rode him as he thrust into me, deepening the intense warmth he
          ignited all over me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My clit strung tight into a painful bud, my stomach tightened in
          knots, and I felt my release at the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," he moaned my name, hot breath fanning against the skin on my
          collarbone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of my name on his lips had my thighs trembling and clenching
          tightly to his, my release rising to the peak as it shattered me
          completely. "Elio, o...ohfffuck." I cried.
        </p>
        <p>
          With one hard thrust, he stilled inside me, and I felt the warmth of
          his release coat my walls. The feeling made me shudder as we came down
          from the high together. My hand slipped from the window, leaving a
          draggy imprint as I relaxed against him, my head on his shoulder; the
          thick smell of sex and sweat lingered around our space.
        </p>
        <p>
          My grip loosened from his hair as I caressed it softly, an attempt to
          ease whatever pain I might have caused.
        </p>
        <p>Our breathing slowly calmed together in sequence.</p>
        <p>"Are you okay?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmyeah." I voiced, lifting myself, my gaze connecting with his dazed
          but hard, confused ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned my head down, my lips just a few inches away from his; I
          moved to kiss him.
        </p>
        <p>He moved his head away. "Good, get off me."</p>
        <p>
          I laughed tauntingly, hiding the discomfort of his rejection and
          hating that it even affected me. This man meant nothing to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why?" I moved against him, and he hissed. "The best sex you ever
          had?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Get off." his voice hardened, and I got the message loud and clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rolling my eyes, I eased myself off him, a little pain pinching
          between my legs as his cock slipped out of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't look at him as I quickly got myself back to being decent. My
          chest felt heavy at the sudden awkward quiet between us. It had to be
          the first awkward silence we'd ever shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at him. He was pulling his sweat pants back on just when I
          dragged the sweater down my head, right after slipping the belt back
          into the hoops of the jeans I wore.
        </p>
        <p>His hand moved to the handle.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait—" I said immediately, making him stop, his head still turned
          away. "You're being weird because you think I really hurt Casmiro."
        </p>
        <p>His throat worked before he turned to look at me. "Didn't you?"</p>
        <p>
          I smoothed both sides of my hair from my face, tucking them behind my
          ears. "Listen...I know you think I'm lying because you believe there
          isn't any honest bone in my body. Sometimes I think so too." I said,
          not taking my eyes from his still confused ones. "I have lied and
          cheated my way through life to the point that being dishonest became
          my default. So I understand why you can't trust me. But I need you to
          give me the benefit of the doubt. Don't look at my eyes or my
          expression; hear my words. I didn't fucking hurt Cassie. I didn't. I
          don't know who did. I promise you."
        </p>
        <p>
          He was silent for a few beats, just staring at me like his head was
          struggling to come to some kind of conclusion, but after a few tense
          seconds, he nodded.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          I drew my brows down, tilting my head slightly to catch his gaze.
          "Okay?"
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." He breathed out. "I believe you."</p>
        <p>
          Gulping down and breathing out, I nodded. "Thank you," I said, rubbing
          my sweaty palms to my jeans. "If you need help finding who did this,
          I'm on board."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." He didn't take his eyes off me.</p>
        <p>"Right. We should—head out."</p>
        <p>
          When he said nothing, I shifted to leave through the other side, but
          his hand encircled my wrist, tugging me back and stopping me from
          leaving.
        </p>
        <p>I looked down at his hand and then at him. "What."</p>
        <p>"I want to break a rule."</p>
        <p>My chest grew heavier than it had been before. "Which one?"</p>
        <p>
          "The one that says this only has to happen once. I will not be able to
          follow that rule, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          I drew in a breath to try to calm the sudden increase in pace my heart
          had carried.
        </p>
        <p>"Would you want that?" He asked.</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, wetting my throat, which had suddenly gone dry. "I've
          never been opposed to it as long as it stays between us," I said. "No
          one can find out."
        </p>
        <p>He didn't see say anything.</p>
        <p>"Would you want that?" I asked this time.</p>
        <p>He hesitated. "I've never done anything like this before."</p>
        <p>"I know," I said.</p>
        <p>
          His gazes moved around my face, and I just knew he was thinking too
          hard about it, weighing consequences, advantages, and
          disadvantages...but after a short minute. He nodded. "Okay. I'm not
          opposed to that either...for now."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, suppressing a smile as I responded.</p>
        <p>"For now." </p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I'D ALWAYS </b>been able to tell whenever someone was about to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was probably because ninety-five percent of my life had been
          spent with death surrounding me. Some by the result of my hands, and
          some by people around me. It had gotten to the point where it didn't
          bother me anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to hate it—the thick smell of gunpowder, capable of making you
          gag once a bullet hit an alive person; the scent of blood and fear
          taint the atmosphere before you see the person falling to the ground.
          I used to hate all of it, even if the victim deserved it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But it had been years since I flinched before pulling a trigger or
          slitting a throat; at this point, it had become the norm for me, and
          it didn't take long enough to attune my senses to the concept of
          death. When it's about to come and when it would most likely spare its
          victim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, standing in front of the room Casmiro was lying in. I knew
          death wasn't around the corner, and the feeling that came with that
          realization didn't exactly sit well with me.
        </p>
        <p>I gave just two knocks before I opened the door and stepped in.</p>
        <p>
          Upper was the only one there when I closed the door behind me, the
          sound making him look up from his phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro still wasn't awake, and according to what I'd heard when Elio
          and I arrived after the sun came up, his vitals were looking good, and
          he was responding well to treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Upper said with a small smile; his eyes were tired, dark
          circles visible underneath them.
        </p>
        <p>"Hi...still here?"</p>
        <p>
          He thinned his lips, looking at Casmiro's still form, the heart
          monitor beeping steadily by the side. My gaze lingered on it for a
          second before I looked back at Upper, who blew a breath, getting to
          his feet. "Where else would I be? I tried calling; you never came back
          last night. What happened?"
        </p>
        <p>"My phone was dead."</p>
        <p>
          He gave me a disbelieving look. "Yeah...and you just randomly
          disappeared with the boss?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. We went back to his house here because he was upset about
          Casmiro. But the building was secured, and he passed out after taking
          a pill since he has sleeping problems, as he said. They took one of
          the shooters in for questioning, though."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Angelo informed me." Upper eyed my form, and I knew he wanted to
          probe. His suspicions about Elio and me were written all over his
          face. To hell if I'm going to divulge anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sure Devil would have blown up my phone with worried texts. Did
          he text you?" I asked, changing the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper's curious stare turned into discomfort as he answered. "Yes,"
          his fingers brushed Casmiro's bedpost. "He couldn't reach you too, so
          he texted. We never text—but like yeah, he wanted to ask about you,"
          he said, gaze flickering to mine. "But I told him you were okay."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Okay...are <i>you</i> okay?"</p>
        <p>His head snapped up to look at me. "What?"</p>
        <p>"You look like you've barely slept." I pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I've not really slept, the whole um—anxiety over what happened
          with Cas and those gunmen and everything; I'm all right though; I
          probably just need to bath in coffee." He let out a shaky laugh that
          didn't reach his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew he was stressed, and I knew the reason behind his stress was
          the event from yesterday, and maybe, Devil? I couldn't be sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at Casmiro's sleeping figure and then at Upper. "You can go
          get coffee; I'll stay with Cas while you're out."
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned, hesitating as his gaze flickered between Casmiro and me.
          "You're sure? I know you're not his biggest fan." He said wearily.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, about that," I blew out a breath. "I was insensitive
          earlier—and like just in the heat of the moment, and I wasn't
          expecting to see you here. I had so many thoughts run through my
          mind...what could have happened and not? But I'm glad he didn't die."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper smiled at me. "I know, it was scary. We've done crazy jobs, but
          never one that had us running from stray bullets. These guys do that
          on a basis."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And now we're working for them," My tongue poked the inner side of my
          cheek.
        </p>
        <p>He eyed me, "You know how to work a gun, so I'm not too worried."</p>
        <p>I opened my mouth to say something.</p>
        <p>
          "It's okay," he chuckled. "Your secret is safe with me, and it's all
          good if you don't want to elaborate."
        </p>
        <p>
          I really did not want to elaborate, so I smiled in appreciation
          instead. "Thank you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's all right; I kind of owe you one for keeping the secret about
          me leaving STREET after we find the gold."
        </p>
        <p>"Upper—"</p>
        <p>"I'll go get that coffee." He cut me off. "Want one?"</p>
        <p>
          A small smile grazed my lips, and I dropped that topic. "Yeah, I could
          use a cup."
        </p>
        <p>He nodded before walking past me and out the door.</p>
        <p>
          I watched the closed door for exactly five seconds before looking back
          at the man on the bed. The room was silent, safe for the beeping of
          the heart monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked over, taking the seat Upper had been in, as I soaked in
          Casmiro's unconscious state. The rise and fall of his chest, his
          breath bouncing to the top of his oxygen mask as he breathed out, and
          dropping as he breathed in. The sound steady and in sync with the beep
          of the machine.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed in exasperation, looking up and around the room.</p>
        <p>No CCTV cameras.</p>
        <p>
          "Are they smart, or are they dumb?" I muttered, only to be met with
          silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tentatively, I sat up and leaned in, shifting the chair closer to his
          bed, before lifting my hand and removing his oxygen mask. I leaned
          back and watched, tilting my head to the side as his lips parted
          slightly, his body unconsciously seeking oxygen assistance. It took
          mere seconds for the sound of the beeping sequence to falter a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seconds for my mind to wander and bring to my mind's vision different
          scenarios that could take place after cutting off his oxygen...his
          heart could fail without the assistance; his body could go into shock,
          and the machine would beep like crazy before it drew a flatline.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head off the thoughts, leaned back, and placed his mask
          back on, dropping my hands to my thighs and watching him. "Oh, Cassie,
          you are one stubborn motherfucker." I mused allowed. "I was hoping
          you'd die. It was three fucking bullets, damn it." I rubbed the side
          of my head, feeling the faint headache grow more profound. "What a
          mess."
        </p>
        <p>
          I willed my brain to stop thinking about this and my heart to stop
          cutting every second with the fear of Elio walking in here and giving
          me that look of suspicion—
        </p>
        <p>No, I am not thinking about this.</p>
        <p>
          Not thinking about the man I'd spent all night thinking about. The
          fact that he wanted to break that rule, how he had looked at me before
          he said he wanted to break the rule, how he had dropped every
          suspicion, believing me on the spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was thankful for that, it still had me a bit wary. He was
          unpredictable; he saw right through and beyond me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wondered how he'd question the idiot I had caught; I wondered what
          the idiot would say in the heat of Elio's unforgiving torture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew Casmiro and Elio were close, but not this much, not so much
          that it kept him up all night, restless. He wanted to go back but had
          changed his mind for some reason. He didn't tell me, didn't speak
          much. When we arrived, he told me to stay here until he returned from
          wherever he, Angelo, and a few of his soldiers went to interrogate the
          man I'd caught.
        </p>
        <p>Angelo had only supplied me with a silent nod as a greeting.</p>
        <p>
          Like Casmiro, I knew he didn't trust or like me, and it bothered me
          because I didn't exactly do anything to warrant that...asides from
          messing around with their boss? Talking back at him or diverting his
          attention from what really mattered—that was it, and I didn't do all
          of that because of some <i>ill intention.</i> I just genuinely liked
          toying with him and getting him to loosen up and get frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not my fault that he looked insanely hot when he frowned or
          yelled...it's fun messing with him...fun seeing him lose himself
          buried inside me...fun hearing him moan my name, so hot and breathy as
          he came inside me and I collapsed against him...God, he really was
          good with his cock and his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          His touch, every single fucking graze, had been deliberate, like he
          wanted to explore so that he could see the way I'd react when he
          touched a part of my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sex was more like a quickie, but goddamn, did I feel it right to
          the tip of my toes. The impact of his powerful thrusts, his grip on
          me, the pure fucking need in his eyes as he owned me and fucked me
          into delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, rubbing my thighs together as the tantalizing ache
          tingled in my core, drawing my attention to how my thoughts had gotten
          me worked up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, slapping my hands on my thigh as I rose to my feet;
          just the exact moment the door pushed open, and a nurse walked in.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hi," she smiled at me, "Can I have the room, please, routine
          checkup."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sure," I returned her smile and left the room. Closing the door
          behind me, I saw Upper coming with two cups of coffee with a confused
          frown.
        </p>
        <p>"Nurse, routine checkup," I explained.</p>
        <p>"Oh," he handed a cup to me.</p>
        <p>
          "Thanks," I said, taking a sip, the familiar taste of his coffee
          blasting on my tongue. I hummed in delight. "Amazing as always."
        </p>
        <p>
          He rolled his eyes and gestured to the door behind me. "You think
          he'll be okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, the doctor said he's doing fine. I don't think you should
          worry." I said, eying him in apprehension. "You don't happen to like
          him, do you?"
        </p>
        <p>His look turned blank. "Seriously?"</p>
        <p>
          "What? You literally left Milan for Turin without a second thought
          just because he asked you to. What do you expect me to think?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He told me he had a racing business. I'd be a fool not to follow
          him." Upper said, "And it didn't seem as if he wanted to hurt me; he
          was actually...kind to me."
        </p>
        <p>"You think he swings that way?"</p>
        <p>
          "He does...we talked a lot about stuff, and yeah, he's bisexual and
          out to basically everyone. And it was shocking because bloody hell,
          he's the underboss of the Marino freaking empire; surely, capos
          wouldn't smile well to that. When I asked him, he said no one would
          dare say anything as long as Elio remained boss. They fear him too
          much to voice their opinions on it." 
        </p>
        <p>"Wow...and there's nothing there? Between you and Cas?"</p>
        <p>
          "No, there's nothing. He has a thing for someone else, and he knows I
          am emotionally unavailable at the moment."
        </p>
        <p>"You guys talked a lot."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, we did. It was easy to talk to him—not like it's not easy to
          talk to you or everyone but—you know—he, um, knows stuff about me,
          like my real name and everything, so it was easy."
        </p>
        <p>"I get it." I nodded. "Did you tell him about, Devil?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No. There's nothing to tell him about, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Doesn't seem like so. If you and Devil like each other so much, I
          don't see why you shouldn't be together."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper shook his head, looking away. "It's not that easy. Things were
          said, and Devil isn't exactly the charming good guy I'd envisioned
          when I was younger. He's hot and good-looking, but it isn't easy with
          him. It's intense, and it's toxic, and there's no time we talk that he
          doesn't say shit to hurt me; it's like he doesn't have any filter. And
          I don't want to help him explore his sexuality; I won't be that guy
          anymore. I was willing, but he...fucked it up." 
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good things come with risks, Upper. I don't know much about love, but
          I know it's not supposed to be easy if it's real. It comes with
          hardships and tears; hell, even blood and fucking sweat. I think it's
          just hard when the heart is really involved, you know. You're doing
          everything to protect yours while he's doing the same."
        </p>
        <p>"And hurting me in the process."</p>
        <p>
          "It's Devil, Upper. He's a controlling motherfucker, and now he's
          trying to control his feeling and yours, and he probably doesn't know
          that by doing that, he's ruining his chances with you. That's my take
          on it...but have you talked to him since things came to light?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You haven't noticed?" Upper asked with a hurt expression. "He's
          avoiding me for some fucked up reason. He doesn't even sleep in the
          room anymore because I'm a walking gay disease, and if he stays too
          close, I'd infect him or something."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm sure he doesn't think that."</p>
        <p>
          "He probably doesn't, but his action does. He fucking texted me, me,
          who was almost shot to death, and the first thing he asks is, 'Where
          is Zahra? Is she okay?' he didn't even check to see if I got grazed by
          a bloody bullet. I'm not saying he shouldn't ask about you, but he
          should at least, I don't know...care? If he ever cared about me, even
          as a bloody teammate." he looked away, drinking from his cup.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wondered why Devil acted this way. The last time we talked about
          Upper, it was evident that he returned Upper's feelings, so why the
          hell is he pulling back?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely not because of me? We ended things, so...what's really going
          on?
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Hours into the day, we arrived back in Milan. Casmiro was transferred
          to the hospital within the compound, and Upper followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio hadn't said a word to me yet, and I waited for Angelo to finish
          talking to him before I approached. He didn't turn to me even after he
          finished; he just walked toward his house. If he wanted me to stop
          following him, he said nothing about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took my time to study the interior of the ample space. It was pretty
          basic, nothing homely, just a dead quiet capable of sending chills
          down your spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The couches had no color, just plain smooth black that seemed like no
          one had ever sat on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the house in Turin, this one had no pictures, almost like the
          space wasn't his, and he was just placed here because it was
          convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed him to another corner of the house; this place harbored one
          couch, a center table, a floor-to-ceiling window, and an elegant bar
          area filled with different expensive-looking drinks, packs of cigars
          arranged perfectly inside a closed glass shelf, and another one filled
          with different kinds of wine glasses—
        </p>
        <p>
          "Any purposive reason you're following me?" he asked, shrugging off
          his jacket, glancing at me before properly hanging it, and moving to
          the vinyl. A few seconds later, some ominous classical music filled
          the air.
        </p>
        <p>He moved to the bar area.</p>
        <p>
          "I wanted to find out what happened with the guy you questioned; did
          he say anything?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio went behind the counter, brows down as he fixed himself a drink,
          pulling out a cigar when he was done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached him and leaned on the counter, waiting for his response.
        </p>
        <p>
          He carefully—like he had all the time in the world—placed the cigar
          between his lips as he spoke. "We did not ask him anything. He has
          been moved to the compound. I was in no mood to torture, so I only
          have him locked up."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "No mood to torture the guy who knows the person
          responsible for Casmiro's condition?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He voiced, lighting the cigar, sucking smoke in, and blowing it
          out, sending that erotic smell of vanilla my way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, what—don't you know you're wasting time? These people could be
          recruiting more men to attack again as we speak."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, picking up his drink. "Maybe." Then he frowned and looked
          at me. "My manners, would you like a drink?"
        </p>
        <p><i>Why the fuck is he so calm?</i><br /></p>
        <p>
          "No," I gave a humorless happy laugh. "I would not like a drink when
          we are sitting ducks and might probably be blown to crisps in any
          second." I grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," he said, cigar between his fingers as he picked his whiskey
          glass and brought it to his lips, downing the content in one go before
          he dropped it and got the cigar between his lips again.
        </p>
        <p>"What is going on, Elio?"</p>
        <p>
          His gaze lifted to mine, and his brows dropped as he stared at me with
          confusion and blew out another smoke streak. "We came back from Turin,
          I talked briefly with Angelo, I came home, you followed me, I asked if
          you would like a drink, you gave an odd laugh and refused, and I said
          okay, and now you're asking what's going on, that is what is going
          on."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him, my mouth gaping open, lost for words. "You are like
          a 15-year-old teenage boy who just can't help but be annoying, just
          for the sake of being annoying."
        </p>
        <p>
          He paused as if thinking about my statement, and then he nodded.
          "Okay."
        </p>
        <p><i>Jesus—</i></p>
        <p>
          "Elio, can we get back to this time, and this day and age where
          Casmiro is still unconscious and you're not actively trying to find
          the people responsible?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We are indeed in this time and day and age. And I will find them. I
          do not rush. I take my time because I like to enjoy it, Zahra. What is
          the best way to inflict worry on your enemies?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know, torturing them?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "Let me tell you a secret." He placed both his
          elbows on the counter, bending and leaning in so he could look me
          right in the eye. His cigar burning away between the fingers on his
          left hand. "I do not like to torture physically—"
        </p>
        <p>"You shot me."</p>
        <p>
          "Your voice bugged me. And I didn't like your tone. Don't interrupt me
          again."
        </p>
        <p>I rolled my eyes but let him continue.</p>
        <p>
          "When I said I do not like to torture physically, I did not mean that
          I refrain from doing it entirely. Sometimes I like to do it, but
          ninety-nine percent of the time, I enjoy playing with the minds of my
          victims. I love painting images and scenarios in their heads. I don't
          seek fear; I seek terror. Fear is so little compared to the pure smell
          of terror you could get from a human body when you meddle with their
          minds."
        </p>
        <p>I gulped down, a bitter taste in my throat.</p>
        <p>
          "I left the man to his mind. I want him to think of all the things he
          would go through, all the questions he would be asked, all the
          <i>lies</i> he would have prepared for them. I want him to
          second-guess <i>everything;</i> I want him at the peak of his mind,
          thinking of the first words I'll say, the first question I'll ask, and
          the first look I'll give him; I want him to get very comfortable with
          his situation. I want him to prepare, to be ready...only then would I
          visit him." He said all through with his eyes flickering between mine,
          searching, waiting, learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed again, my throat beyond dry. "And what if his people are
          recruiting? What if—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "They would never dare it. Not without thorough preparation. Not
          without starting a war that would most likely affect each man and
          those who share his last name, not without ensuring they can take down
          this empire. I would like to think it would take months of preparing.
          Because if it doesn't, and they storm in here with guns and bombs at
          the ready. Existences would be wiped out; they know that, and this
          reason alone is why I will win."
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold chill ran down my spine. "Why do you have to be so intense."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am under the influence, and I am in your presence, so yes," his
          eyes searched mine.
        </p>
        <p>"What has my presence got to do with your intensity?"</p>
        <p>
          His lips lifted a little at the side. "You arouse me, Zahra. Mind,
          body, and soul. I am always ready to talk when you're here; your
          influence on me is...highly delectable."
        </p>
        <p>
          Something was melting in my chest, sinking and rubbing against the
          walls of my stomach with a tickle that made my stomach feel excited,
          sending a hot zap to my core.
        </p>
        <p>This man is fucking with my mind.</p>
        <p>And I...like it.</p>
        <p>
          "Have I finally succeeded in shutting you up with something other than
          my cock, Querida?"
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed, clearing my throat and straightening.</p>
        <p>
          Amusement lingered in his eyes as he watched me. "You didn't shut me
          up." I lied. "As embarrassing as it might sound, I was trying to
          understand the meaning of delectable."
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm-umm." He hummed mockingly, still watching me.</p>
        <p>"I'm being dead-ass."</p>
        <p>"Did I counter it?"</p>
        <p>
          "Not with words—your little <i>hmm-umm</i> sound did all the
          countering I needed to hear."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, bringing his cigar to his lips again, sucking it in before
          quenching the fire on the ashtray, not once looking away from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned his head to the side a bit, dark grey eyes still on me as
          thick white smoke danced out of his mouth, caressing my cheek and
          increasing the dull thumping between my legs. "You need to talk to
          your team members; they might wonder why you are not back."
        </p>
        <p>"They don't—"</p>
        <p>
          "I am going to try to get some sleep. Things blur around when I've
          been awake for more than 72 hours...I get a little...light in the
          head."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, my teeth pressing on my bottom lip before I released it and
          spoke. "When do we see each other again?"
        </p>
        <p>His lips twitched as he watched me, "I will call."</p>
        <p>
          "Or I could just sneak out whenever I can? Cause you have so many
          drinks, and your house is huge?"
        </p>
        <p>"Would dropping by now and then make you satisfied?"</p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>"I will let security know you're allowed to come in whenever."</p>
        <p>Just like that...</p>
        <p>
          I chucked in the feeling of unease for later as I grinned instead.
          "Awesome." I placed both my hands on the table. "I'll go now, and I
          would have kissed you if it wasn't <i>banned</i>, but yeah, you have
          your <i>reasons</i>." I air quoted at banned and reasons.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." He didn't take those eyes off me. <br /></p>
        <p>I shook my head, leaning away. "I'll see you, weirdo."</p>
        <p>
          With that, I turned and walked away, knowing his eyes followed my
          every move.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind slipped back to his words to me at the car after I'd asked him
          to give me the benefit of the doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was out of the house, I let my mouth and brows fall into a
          stern frown as I muttered to myself and pulled out my phone. "<i
            >I believe you</i
          >, my ass." 
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The scene I walked into, even as I got back to our quarter, didn't do
          shit to calm my nerves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just from the look of things, I knew something was terribly fucking
          wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk, Dog, and Devil stood in front of the kitchen, speaking in hush
          voices. They were arguing about something, their faces etched in hard
          frowns. "What's going on?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument stopped, and they all looked up at once. The—deer in a
          headlight—look I caught on their faces calmed down when they saw it
          was me.
        </p>
        <p>"Thank fuck you're back." Dog said. "Shit went down."</p>
        <p>"Big shit." Milk said.</p>
        <p>"Where's Upper?" Devil asked, eyes narrowing behind me.</p>
        <p>
          I walked up to them. "He's with Casmiro; he's fine. What's going on?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil looked at Dog and Milk and then back at me. "We don't have time
          to wait for him...when you both left, we got an anonymous email."
        </p>
        <p>That got my attention. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," Milk voiced. "Dog tried to trace it, but it was fruitless. The
          encoder knew how to code."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Upper might have been able to pull it off, but he went after dick,
          so..." Dog frowned.
        </p>
        <p>"What was it about? The mail."</p>
        <p>
          "The damn chihuahua." Dog said. "They sent us a location with a short
          note that said.
          <b
            >'The package you find is the key to finding the original
            painting.'</b
          >
          <i>There</i>, that look you're giving right now is the very one I had
          after reading it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, shaking my head. "Who the fuck would send us that? Or try
          to help? Who knows we're on the hunt for this thing?"
        </p>
        <p>"That's not even the worst part." Milk said.</p>
        <p>I narrowed my eyes at them.</p>
        <p>"We went to the location, and we did find something," Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't even want to ask because I had no fucking clue on what they
          would have found, but I knew that whatever the hell it was, it
          couldn't be good.
        </p>
        <p>"What did you find?"</p>
        <p>
          They all exchanged wary looks; the silence stretched, doing wonders in
          heightening my already heightened nerves.
        </p>
        <p>"What is it? The suspense is killing me." I urged.</p>
        <p>
          Milk backed towards the kitchen. "Right here in the kitchen; promise
          you won't freak out."
        </p>
        <p>"I can't promise when I don't even know what it is."</p>
        <p>
          "Well, come on." Devil gestured with his head as we headed into the
          kitchen. Milk stopped behind the counter, her gaze on the spot by the
          fridge and the cupboard a few inches above the ground before she
          looked at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I approached with all my guard intact and looked toward the direction
          her eyes had been in.
        </p>
        <p>
          A gasp left my parted lips, and my whole body went completely
          frozen.<br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>WE STEAL, </b>we cheat, and we piss off bad guys, but we don't
          usually kidnap people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if we held someone against their will, we always wore masks and
          never brought them to where we lived. We don't leave a trace of
          ourselves for the victim to recognize, and we most definitely do not
          kidnap guys in cream-colored dad khakis and a sky-blue polo shirt with
          a chef hat logo by the left side and a name tag that says 'Saucy
          Chika.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, staring at a dark-skinned, brown-eyed scared man whose head
          moved frantically around us as he tried to shift further away. His
          breathing became so loud, and he was humming his words because his
          mouth was covered by a wide silver tape, legs and hands were tied in
          what looked like a complicated knot that made it difficult for him to
          move.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes were wide in fear, and I couldn't-<i>couldn't</i> think of a
          reason as to...why this stranger was tied up in our kitchen or how the
          fuck they were able to get him in there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded slowly and then turned to my people. "Let's step outside for
          a bit." I ushered them with my hands, a smile on my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we were a reasonable distance from the kitchen, I turned sharply
          to the three people in front of me. "Who the fuck is that?"
        </p>
        <p>"We have no idea," Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          "You have—" My hand covered my mouth as I looked around as if people
          would charge in any minute to get us for this. When my eyes settled on
          STREET again, I took my hand off my mouth as I leaned in and whisper
          yelled. "You have no idea why a guy who looks like a nine-to-five
          counter boy at an upgraded version of MacDonalds is tied up in our
          fucking kitchen?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," Milk answered this time, eying me. "Devil just said that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned back. "What is happening right now? Did you guys tie him up?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil shook his head, crossing his arms to his chest, his biceps
          straining against the Henley he wore, "We found him like that at the
          pick-up point under some bridge, very secluded. He was in some truck.
          Knocked out, and we brought him here."
        </p>
        <p>
          I chewed on my bottom lip hard before shaking my head. "This is bad.
          What the fuck does he have to do with the Chihuahua?" I voiced the
          question.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm guessing that's what we need to ask him." Milk said.</p>
        <p>
          "He looks just about ready to shit his pants." Dog voiced. "I
          personally just want to know why his name tag says Saucy. What the
          fuck is that about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil shot him an annoyed frown. "I'm more concerned about the people
          who dropped him off and reached out to us to pick him up."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, me too." Milk joined. "If Saucy Chika knows anything about
          Arturo's Chihuahua, why would the people who dropped him off want us
          to decipher it? Why us? And why Saucy Chika?"
        </p>
        <p>"You just love saying Saucy Chika." Dog smirked at Milk.</p>
        <p>
          "What? It's a sexy combination that flows well with my accent, and now
          I think everyone should have at least one sexy—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Guys, can we focus on the real matter here?" I cut in. "We gotta find
          out who he is and let him go before Marino finds out, and this all
          goes to shit before it even starts—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The front door opened, and Upper walked in, attention on his phone as
          he closed the door behind him. He looked up in a double take and
          slowed to a stop, peering at us with wary drawing down his brows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What did you fuckers do now?" he asked when he reached us, pocketing
          his phone.
        </p>
        <p>"Kidnapped someone," I informed.</p>
        <p>
          "We didn't kidnap anyone," Devil injected immediately. "He was already
          kidnapped before we...took him from the car where he was tied up
          and...brought him here."
        </p>
        <p>Silence befell us as we stared at each other.</p>
        <p>"If we're being logical, that's still kidnapping," Milk voiced.</p>
        <p>
          "Worse than kidnapping," Upper supported. "It's double kidnapping;
          we've taken kidnapping to a level that borders on diabolical because
          we took a kidnapped person and kidnapped them, which means we are the
          kidnappers of the kidnapped."
        </p>
        <p>"That doesn't make any fucking sense, Upper." Dog said.</p>
        <p>Milk shrugged. "It made sense to me."</p>
        <p>"Of course, it would; you're...you." Dog frowned.</p>
        <p>
          "I hope you didn't mean that in an offensive way." Milk said, turning
          slightly to face him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please, by all means, take all the offense because that is what I was
          aiming for."
        </p>
        <p>"Guys, back to Saucy Chika—"</p>
        <p>"Who is Saucy Chika?" Upper asked confusion in his tone.</p>
        <p>
          "The guy we kidnapped," Devil answered, and then silence fell again.
          He closed his eyes for a second before snapping them back open. "No,
          we didn't kidnap—he was—you know what? It doesn't fucking matter;
          let's go untie him and get our answers, alright?"
        </p>
        <p>
          We all seemed to agree with that as we returned to the kitchen. Saucy
          Chika's eyes were wide, and his hums of protest became frantic as
          Devil tore off the tape not so gently from his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck!" Saucy Chika cursed, breathing harshly with his mouth as he
          looked frantically around us. "Who are you people?" His faint roadman
          British accent coated his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your worst nightmare," Dog whispered, dragging it in a dramatic
          light.
        </p>
        <p>"My what?" the confused man asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Ignore him," Devil said, undoing the knots on Saucy Chika's legs. "He
          was diagnosed with idiotism a while back."
        </p>
        <p>The man frowned. "Is that a thing?"</p>
        <p>
          Devil extended his hand to help pull him up. "It's now a thing," he
          huffs a breath as they both rose to their full height, "He was patient
          zero."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," Saucy Chika eyed Dog warily like the idiotism thing was
          contagious. "Why are you...releasing me?" He asked no one in
          particular, rubbing his wrist while Devil gave him his space to
          collect himself.
        </p>
        <p>I took a step forward. "Because we didn't kidnap you."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, we just took you from your kidnappers. Which makes us worse
          than them." Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil settled his gaze on Upper. "We got an anonymous email that a
          package they would send would answer questions about Arturo Garza's
          chihuahua. We got to the location and found him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," Upper frowned. "Anonymous email..." He looked at Dog. "Were you
          able to track it?"
        </p>
        <p>"No luck; I was hoping you'd have some."</p>
        <p>Upper nodded, "On it." he was already leaving the kitchen.</p>
        <p>
          I studied the victim in front of me; his brows were drawn down in
          confusion, eyes unfocused.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is it? Does the name Arturo Garza sound familiar to you?" I
          asked him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His throat worked. "I don't..." he trailed off, swaying on his feet; I
          quickly rushed towards him, holding him steady, while Devil took care
          of his other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think we should get him to a chair," I said to Devil and then
          looked at Milk. "Can you arrange a quick sandwich and an energy
          drink?"
        </p>
        <p>"Sure."</p>
        <p>
          Devil and I led him to the living room, and Dog followed right behind
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We settled Saucy Chika on a chair, and he rubbed his head as a groan
          left him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a chair opposite him, and Dog settled on the arm of the chair
          while Devil stood at the side when Upper walked in with a laptop,
          settling on a couch as he worked on finding who sent that email.
        </p>
        <p>"What's your name?" I asked him.</p>
        <p>
          "Chika," he answered as Milk came out with a sandwich and a glass of
          water, I was sure was mixed with something that would give him his
          energy back. "Thank you," he said with a smile, which she returned
          before taking the space next to Upper.
        </p>
        <p>"Why is there Saucy right before Chika, though." Dog asked.</p>
        <p>"Dog," I groaned in a warning.</p>
        <p>"What? Don't pretend like you don't want to know too."</p>
        <p>
          Chika drank half of the water in the glass before dropping it down and
          picking up the sandwich. "It's company protocol." He answered, taking
          a bite.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Company protocol to...put in something sexy before your name?" Dog
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My boss is a sadist," Chika informed with his mouth full. "My name's
          even more bearable; we have Busty Chloe, Sex god Mason, COCK-ey
          Christian, and the most terrible, Glistening pink Candy. It only gets
          worse from this point."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why do you <i>work</i> there?" I couldn't help but ask because that
          protocol was shit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Try leaving a job that pays a thousand dollars every three hours just
          for you to wear a shitty name tag while serving shitty people in the
          city of London. My college tuition and rent won't pay themselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          "A thousand dollars every three hours—that's amazing! What name do you
          think I'll get?" Milk asked with an excited grin.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Juicy Milk, definitely Juicy Milk," I said with a wide smile, nodding
          with Milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come back again. Did you say London?" Devil cut into our distracting
          exchange.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah mate—wait, where is this?" he looked around.</p>
        <p>"Italy...Milan."</p>
        <p>Chika almost choked on the sandwich he was eating. "Say what?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah, you are far from home, spider man." Dog said.</p>
        <p>"What day is it?" he asked with wide eyes.</p>
        <p>"Uh...October 11th? Wednesday, the year 2023?" Milk said</p>
        <p>"Holy shit." Chika mused aloud. "Holy fucking shit?"</p>
        <p>"Is he having a seizure?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          Chika dropped the half-eaten sandwich and picked up the glass of
          water, gulping everything down so loud before he finished and dropped
          the glass on the center table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am sweating." he untucked his polo. "I am sweating so bad, I need
          air."
        </p>
        <p>"The aircon's working perfectly." Milk answered.</p>
        <p>
          "I am sweating tears right now because I just lost my job...and I—and
          I didn't do a very important quiz for an essential class that I am
          failing and had gone on my knees begging for an extra quiz for, and I
          missed a school competition where I was supposed to give a debate
          about fire and water and which is more important—"
        </p>
        <p>"That's dumb," Upper said.</p>
        <p>
          "I know," Chika said, blowing out a breath and, well—freaking out.
          "This is fucked up. The last time I was conscious was on the 7th. I
          can't remember anything after I was attacked."
        </p>
        <p>I sat up. "What happened? Tell us what you remember."</p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "I was at work as usual. I went out to take out the trash,
          and then there were footsteps, and before I could turn to look, a
          white handkerchief was on my nose, and I'm here."
        </p>
        <p>"They kept sedating him," Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, kept him somewhere clean, too; that's why he still looks fresh
          out of a shitty situation." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you know Arturo Garza?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          He scoffed. "Do I know him? Even in death—even in fucking death—the
          old man still finds a way to fuck up my life—him and that godforsaken
          chihuahua."
        </p>
        <p>"So, you do know him."</p>
        <p>"Yeah, he was my father."</p>
        <p>"Impossible." I refused. "Arturo Garza didn't have children."</p>
        <p>
          "So says everyone who <i>knows</i> him." Chika laughed humorlessly. "I
          was his adopted mistake. I did not know why he adopted me, only to
          abandon me." the hate in his voice told me he knew why, and when he
          spoke again, we all knew why. "Maybe because he wanted a Nigerian son
          because his lover when he was a teenager was from there, and he
          thought he could get that back through me, but in a platonic way that
          he soon realized he couldn't." He said in one breath, looking around
          us before clearing his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But he's no longer in the chapter of my life, so whoever thought it
          was fun to kidnap me because they think I have some info about him
          just wasted their fucking time."
        </p>
        <p>"So, you don't know anything about the painting?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>"Or the quest?" Devil added in question.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, the stupid quest. All he ever worked on, strategizing, being a
          mastermind of his own fucking making, bullshit man."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So you are wealthy; why work in some make-believe MacDonalds?" Dog
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I refused Arturo's help and money. When he was turning all
          his assets to gold, he wanted to give me a chunk of it, but I told him
          to give it to his real child and get the fuck out of my life and
          face."
        </p>
        <p>"His real child being the Chihuahua," I noted.</p>
        <p>"Yes. And he did, and I was free until—now."</p>
        <p>
          Devil frowned. "The people who took you must have a valid reason for
          doing so unless you wouldn't be here. You know something about the
          quest. It's only a matter of time before the other people find out,
          and you're hunted. We can offer you protection if you tell us all you
          know."
        </p>
        <p>
          Chika's eyes scanned us uncertainly, his stare saying that he did know
          something and was holding back. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "Listen, I don't want to get involved in Arturo's business. I have
          spent years, <i>years</i> trying to forget that I had someone like
          that as a parent, and I did. I moved to London, started a new life,
          and got a banging job that pays a lot of money so people can say Saucy
          Chika every time they see me while my sadist of a boss wanks on it
          while he watches like a creep from the computers in his office."
        </p>
        <p>"That is very gross." Milk said.</p>
        <p>
          "The money is worth it." He spoke. "The only thing I know about the
          painting is that every piece was kept in one place; here in Milan,
          it's a heavily guarded warehouse. They ship them off little by little
          to different states and countries. I don't know how the time works
          with the shipping or its sequence. I only know the location where you
          can find all the paintings. And I only know this by mistake; I
          overheard him once during his masterminding sessions to himself and
          the dog. I thought he was going crazy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled to myself. "The location would be perfect. Just tell us what
          you need in exchange for this info, and we'll provide it."
        </p>
        <p>"You offered to give me protection."</p>
        <p>"You don't want money?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I don't want his money, your money, or gang crime money. I don't want
          any of it; I wanna go back to my life."
        </p>
        <p>My gaze met Devil's, and he nodded with a shrug.</p>
        <p>
          "You're in luck, Chika. I happen to know someone who can provide you
          the kind of protection you need until all this is over."
        </p>
        <p>He let out a breath of relief. "You're going to let me go now?"</p>
        <p>"No," I said.</p>
        <p>Upper looked up and shot me a frown. "No? We are letting him go."</p>
        <p>
          Chika's worried eyes fell on me. "If I even want to salvage my job or
          placate my boss, I <i>have</i> to go now."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "I am sorry about your job, school, and life, but
          you're in this now. You are part of the narrative, and you'll go with
          us when we want to get the paintings."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You want him to put his life on hold for us?" Milk asked, looking at
          me with disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>I got to my feet and paced the room. "I know it's insensitive—"</p>
        <p>
          "It's beyond insensitive, Zahra," Upper said. "He has been kidnapped
          for days."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We didn't kidnap him. We don't know who did. We need more time to
          study our situation before we let him out with our protection." I
          looked at Chika. "It's for your safety and our gain, Chika. A win-win
          situation."
        </p>
        <p>"I see a point in that." Dog said.</p>
        <p>"You can stay here for now," I told him.</p>
        <p>
          Upper shook his head. "What about Marino's people? If they catch wind
          of this—"
        </p>
        <p>I shrugged. "They won't; we'll be careful," I said.</p>
        <p>"A word, Zahra," Devil said, heading for the kitchen.</p>
        <p>
          With a sigh and a disapproving stare from Upper and Milk, I followed
          Devil to the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>"Let me guess; you don't agree with me," I stated.</p>
        <p>
          Dark eyes watched me. "It's not that, Z. I just need to know why
          you're brushing away the fact that some unknown person out there gave
          us this much means to get information about the painting. Something
          big is obviously at work here."
        </p>
        <p>"Devil—"</p>
        <p>
          "They kidnapped someone, Z., All the way from London and dropped them
          on our laps, for free, just like that. It doesn't happen. It's above
          our damn pay grade, and as much as I hate to say this, I think we
          should tell Marino."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "We are not telling them until we confirm the source is legit. Until
          we find the paintings."
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned, confused. "Why? Is there a loophole I don't know about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my lips. "There are no loopholes; I know as much
          as you do, D. Just trust me on this; if there's one thing we can hold
          against Marino to guarantee our safety out of this, it's our leverage
          with this information."
        </p>
        <p>He didn't look convinced, but he didn't counter it.</p>
        <p>
          "Guys," Upper's voice called from the living room, Devil and I locked
          gazes before we exited the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What happened?" Devil asked as we watched Upper frown at the laptop
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't get the person who gave the info, but I traced it down to a
          region."
        </p>
        <p>"In Italy?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah...Sicily, that's where it came from. Everything else is blocked
          by a wall, and it would take me forever to decode."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know about this, guys. Who the hell knows us from Sicily?"
          Milk said.
        </p>
        <p>"Or maybe it was a cover route?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          "No, their cover route was China, but I broke it. It's Sicily. Real
          name unknown, direct location unknown."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I remember hearing Sicilian and a little bit of Italian," Chika said.
          "My first language is Spanish, and I couldn't really get what they
          were saying, but from what I heard, it sounded like it was Italian or
          Sicilian; I can't be sure."
        </p>
        <p>
          My spine straightened. "It doesn't matter where they're from or who
          they are," I said. "We need to find the original painting, and  get
          the gold. Whoever they are, we are one information richer, and that's
          all that matters right now."
        </p>
        <p>When I got nods of approval, I released a breath.</p>
        <p>"Come on, guys; we have lots of planning to do."<br /></p>

        <p>
          In all honesty, I could not be certain, but from the moment my heavy
          eye lids opened, I knew I had been benumbed for a long time, a day or
          maybe two. It was all murky. To think felt like the most difficult
          task my brain had ever had to carry. My body felt heavy and slow, and
          it took great effort to turn my head to the side of the bed to check
          the time. It was 10:57 PM; I turned away, my eyes settling on the
          plain white ceiling above me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quietness around me was disturbing, and the room was dimly-lit,
          the windows closed, the air conditioner working at an average level,
          not too cold, not too hot, covers drawn up to my mid stomach, curtains
          closed. <i>Angelo had been here</i>. I could discern that from the lit
          lamps around the room. I never turned them on before I filled myself
          with pills and passed out. I also didn't close the curtains and
          windows or use the duvet or change the air temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a groan, I sat up and rubbed my eyes, ignoring how light-headed I
          felt, how tight my muscles were, and how tired I was for no reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a transcendent urge to fall back against the bed and never get
          up until I exigently had to. But doing that was equivalent to signing
          myself up for a depressive episode that I would be very willing to let
          overcome me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't have the time to be reposed. There was work to do—a painting
          to find. People to torture and kill for touching one of my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>There was...</i>my thoughts trailed off, and doubts took hold of my
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was the point in any of this? In finding the painting and
          torturing people paid to carry out orders from people who felt as
          though they could cross me and get away with it. I should just—
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>
          "Not today," I muttered, stretching my neck from left to right while
          removing the thick covers from atop me and dragging myself out of bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          My stomach ached with pangs of hunger, supplying me the substantiation
          that I had been out for hours on end, forcing rest when I should be
          out there doing something worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          I headed straight for the bathroom, catching my reflection in the
          mirror. The instant burn of irritation I felt in my chest was not
          erasable. My eyes were sunken, white and lifeless, my skin pale, lips
          a bit blue, hair a mess—
        </p>
        <p>
          I held both sides of the sink, my grip hard as I tried to fight off
          the unnecessary self-disappointment weighing on my shoulders like
          ancient rocks.
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head and proceeded to brush my teeth and then shower.</p>
        <p>
          Taking my time, I scrubbed my skin with the primary aim of washing
          myself <i>off </i>myself. But like the many times I'd tried, it was
          impossible; my gaze kept shifting to the bathtub by the side, and it
          took every bit of my willpower to stop myself from approaching it and
          using it for all the wrong purposes.
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head yet again and made haste.</p>
        <p>
          Finished showering, moisturized my skin, and put on a fresh loose
          black t-shirt and black slacks, even though I really wanted to wear
          sweatpants, which were more accessible. But I was home and it was
          night time, and the T-shirt was already a stretch out of what I knew
          to be my comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly brushed my hair and exited the bathroom like I was being
          chased out. Many items in there were triggering, and I was physically,
          emotionally, and mentally incapable of dealing with the aftermath of
          my weakness and carelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was already doing a lot, schooling my brain and mind to go through a
          reasonable lane with its thoughts for the day—or night, rather.
        </p>
        <p>
          All I needed now was a book, a cigar, food—if I had enough zeal to
          even stomach anything—and some peace and quiet outside...maybe at the
          rooftop, which I can no longer go to without thinking of the one woman
          that had plastered herself in my mind before I lost all sense of
          consciousness the last time I was awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I couldn't afford my train of thought directed back to her.
          It would most definitely bring back the mind-numbing conflict I had
          been battling with myself since I caught every bit of the lies she had
          woven into truths.
        </p>
        <p>She confused me—yet, she didn't.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra was playing a game, one that I couldn't decipher or break down
          on my own. Her dishonesty was disappointing. I had shared my baggage,
          opened up to her so she could feel free to do the same without having
          to cross a path where she'd openly betray me, and I'd have no choice
          but to kill her for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But apparently, like me, she treated trust like a possession too hard
          to let go of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't sure if she had anything to do with Casmiro's situation. I
          didn't want to jump to conclusions and make a mistake based on the way
          I felt—she made me doubt it; for the first time in my life, I doubted
          myself just because Zahra had looked at me some kind of way, just
          because she has shut me up by letting me have her in a way that had
          made me ache for more since our time in that car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never in a million years did I think a woman would be why I
          temporarily lose my senses or break a rule I had put in place with the
          intent to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a second thought, I, Elio Marino, had tied myself in an
          entanglement that had me holding myself back from doing any physical
          damage that might bring up a topic I had promised her I wouldn't speak
          about since it made her upset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caring for Zahra Faizan was not on my agenda, and as much as I would
          love to deny it till I believed the lie, the thought of her would
          never let me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could be fucking the enemy, and the only thought in my mind—the only
          thought that had been in my mind that night was the fact that I longed
          for the next time I got to experience being that close to her again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heat, the obscene connection that had me wanting to tear off my
          outrageous affirmation and kiss her back into arousal, the burning
          need still lingering in me even after I'd had the most mind-altering
          sex in all my thirty-three years of living.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd had orgasms with the few women I'd been with, but I never thought
          it could feel like that...I never thought the feeling could soften
          every nerve ending in a human body and make them feel contented with
          just the sight of the person who had caused it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she had been my first, I would have waved it off as the normal way
          it should feel, but she wasn't my first. She wasn't the first woman
          I'd desired, but she was the first to elicit such emotions from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought I was losing my mind and that I lacked sleep; it was the
          only explanation as to why looking at her made me feel—different—but
          now I'm awake, and the feeling didn't budge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I do not like it. I do not like the fact that I didn't want my
            thoughts to stray back to her, but it ends up doing that any way!
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was craving a forbidden fruit that might very well drag me to the
          darkest pits of hell—but this was also where my gut feeling kicked in;
          if she had been trying to harm me in any way, I would have picked it
          up by now, but I had a gut feeling that whatever game she was playing
          had nothing to do with me, she was only using my name and the
          protection and connection I had to offer without my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't have cared. Zahra wasn't the first to use me or the power
          my name held. I had no desire to stop whatever she was planning or
          doing; as long as it didn't alter my main goal, she was free to use me
          however she pleased; I only wanted to stop the inevitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          So many people had died by offending me while my men stood at a
          visionary and ear-sensitive distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be mostly...inconvenient if it happened this way with Zahra;
          that was why for the first time, I decided to offer her a benefit of
          the doubt while drilling my way into her mind and affecting her the
          same way she now affected me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe she would open up...or perhaps I was just delusional, and my gut
          feelings were broken, and she was indeed after something that could
          alter my goals and stop me from burning this hell to the ground; maybe
          I should kill her before I fall deeper into this obvious hole I had
          been conveniently ignoring...maybe I don't know...maybe I am finally
          losing my mind. Maybe I should stop thinking about—
        </p>

          A sharp beep sound, followed by a vibration, had my attention turned
          to the lit-up phone screen by the bedside table.
        </p>
        <p>It was connected to a charger I didn't remember putting there.</p>
        <p>
          Angelo and his creepy behavior were beginning to crawl their way up my
          nerves. I made a mental note to have a lengthy discussion with him

        </p>
        <p>
          I settled on the side of the bed, unplugged the phone, and unlocked
          it.

        <p>
          There were four messages from Gemma, nine from Zahra, and one from
          Angelo.

        <p>
          I sighed, clicking the call icon at the top of the screen. He picked
          up on the first ring.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Finally. I was about to stop by with a doctor." </i></p>
        <p>"How is he?" I asked, ignoring his remark.</p>
        <p><i>"Looking good. He's resting now." </i></p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes for a few seconds, reveling in the relief that
          flooded through me. "Did he ask for me?"
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          "Tell him I'm back and will come to see him soon. Thanks for covering

        <p>
          Casmiro could not find out about this. About my mental health issues
          or my battle between sanity and insanity. He was better off not
          knowing—one less person to worry about.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Will you ever tell him? About your—"</i></p>
        <p>
          "Thank you for the information, Angelo. Do not text me next time

          'significant.' Am I clear?"
        </p>
        <p>I heard him sigh from the other end of the line.</p>

          The photo she sent was of her chest, her hand covering the top half of

          now bruised around the corners of the tattoo, the dove drawing was
          really beautiful, larger than I imagined, and it suited her skin

        <p>
          I shook my head. It was odd, the kind of friendship we shared. Gemma
          was a free-spirited woman who reminded me so much of my sister. While
          their personalities might differ in several places, I shared a
          closeness with this stranger that had me adding her to the list of
          people I had to make sure were okay before I saw to the end of my
          goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          She texted me daily, and I always responded whenever I wasn't too
          busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had asked her about her said 'Uncle Rod' after she told me she had
          no blood relative asides from her grandmother, and she had told me he
          used to be their neighbor at their old apartment, and that was what
          everyone called him.
        </p>
        <p>It hadn't been a lie.</p>
        <p>
          Gemma Parisi was honest to a fault. It was impressive, but it paved
          the way for people like me to exploit that honesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had no intention of doing that, though. There was a positive feeling
          I got whenever I spoke to her. I needed to find what exactly had me
          indulging her. I knew there was something, and I had to get to the
          bottom of it.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Hello.</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>Me:</b><br /><b

            tomorrow and next. Let me know your schedule.</b

        </p>
        <p>
          After I sent the message, I reread it, hoping I didn't pass across the
          wrong message. I wasn't well versed in the world of texting, and it
          was worrisome how one text could be interpreted into many meanings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I exited her message box and let my thumb finger hover above Zahra's
          message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something bizarre happened at that moment. I felt a small squeezing
          burn in my chest; an odd—out of place—nervousness gripped me out of
          nowhere, and I hesitated for a long time before clicking on her name.

          I frowned at the last message and looked around the room as if I'd
          spot a trace of her. There was nothing.
        </p>
        <p>But she was here. A few minutes ago.</p>
        <p>I clicked on the call icon above the screen without thinking.</p>
        <p>
          Drumming my finger against my knee, I felt another squeeze in my chest

        <p>
          I frowned, my brain already taking a route down its familiar
          overthinking lane. This is why I was not too fond of phone calls,
          receiving or initiating one. They never came with a positive outcome.
          Either something was wrong, or the person you're trying to reach
          doesn't respond or, in my case now—declines the call.
        </p>

        <p>
          The phone buzzed in my hand, Zahra's name flashing on the screen. I
          watched it ring for a decent stretch of seconds, and then I picked it
          up and pressed the phone to my ear.

          <i>"Hi?" </i>Her voice came through, uncertain, soft, far away. I

          opened my eyes again.

          nervousness in that small gesture.
        </p>
        <p>
          A calm settled within me. "Your voice...it's different on the phone."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I heard a small laugh.<i>
            "Of course it is; you're hearing it through signals from a satellite
            in space."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fascinating," I relaxed back on the bed. "I didn't know that;
          enlighten me on satellites and space that I definitely know nothing
          about."
        </p>
        <p><i>"And he says I'm insufferable."</i></p>
        <p>
          "We are alike in so many ways. Therefore I concede that it is normal
          for both of us to be insufferable."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Smart ass." </i></p>
        <p>"I have an IQ of 150, so yes. I am smart."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"You weren't supposed to respond to that. For a man with an IQ of
            150, you lack basic conversational skills."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Being academically intelligent is not equal to being socially
          intelligent."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Fine, I give up."</i></p>
        <p>"As you should."</p>
        <p>Silence stretched.</p>
        <p><i>"So Cassie's awake."</i> She broke it.</p>
        <p>"Indeed."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Did you see him yet? Any valuable information he might have to
            pass across about the people who did this?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I sighed. "I don't want to talk about Casmiro."</p>
        <p><i>"Oh...okay then, what do you want to talk about?" </i></p>
        <p>"Food. I think I'm hungry."</p>
        <p>
          I could hear the smile in her voice as she said,<i>
            "You're in luck. I haven't had my dinner yet. In fact, I was about
            to eat when your call came in. Give me a second, I'll be there, and
            you can eat me—I mean, eat with me. </i
          ><b><i>With</i></b
          ><i> me. Jesus fuck—bye." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The line cut off abruptly, and I stared at the screen, unable to stop
          my lips from curling at the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few useless seconds of replaying our conversation, I got off
          the bed, walked to my dresser, and pulled out one of the drawers. I
          picked up the cigar box and quickly lit one up while I paced the room,
          waiting—wait. No. Not waiting—reading, yes, reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grabbed the book by my bedside table, put on my reading glasses, and
          then settled back on the bed. Sucking a lung full of smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          It burned against my chest, sending the breath out of me in an instant
          and clogging my windpipe; the feeling compelled a cough out of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's a first." I mused aloud, blowing out the smoke while stifling
          the cough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, ignoring the feeling as it subsided. Somehow, the
          pain the cigar caused pushed me to take another drag, expecting to
          feel the burn—nothing happened.
        </p>
        <p>Disappointment weighed heavily on my shoulders.</p>
        <p>I fought off the thought and focused on the book in my grip.</p>
        <p>
          About 40 minutes into the book, the cigar had been discarded, hunger
          forgotten, and the sound of my door quietly pushing open became a
          background disturbance.
        </p>
        <p>I looked up briefly to catch Zahra walking in.</p>
        <p>"Your idea of a second is worrisome."</p>
        <p>"Shut up; I had to make sure it was safe enough to sneak out."</p>
        <p>I marked the page and then dropped the book on my bedside table.</p>
        <p>
          Unintentionally, my gaze took her in, sweeping from her head to her
          toe and then back to her head. She was in a different silk nightgown,
          blood red, with a robe adorned over it. I watched her drop the food
          bag on the two-seater couch beside one of the dressers.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to me, her short hair brushed to curly perfection, as she
          stared at me like a package handed to her on a platter. She was in awe
          for some reason. It would be quite embarrassing to admit that the look
          had me feeling the same way compliments made me feel—flustered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's late already, you shouldn't be walking around the compound
          dressed like that." I said, and she looked down at herself innocently.
        </p>
        <p>"Dressed like what?"</p>
        <p>"In a night gown."</p>
        <p>
          A smile curled onto her lips. "Well I told you, it's all silk inside
          my wardrobe." She argued.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why do I have the urge to see your wardrobe?" I asked, and her eyes
          widened and sparkled beautifully in mischief, lips curling to the side
          in a smile as she approached the bed like she had done this particular
          action many times before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe because you are a fucking weirdo," she said, her sly smile
          turned genuine as she got on the bed. "and a creep with serial killer
          genes."
        </p>
        <p>
          A twitch in my cock told me I liked the way she gracefully climbed
          onto my bed, and how perfect she looked atop it. "There's no such
          thing as the serial killer genes, Zahra"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I saw a TV show once. One of the main characters had serial killer
          genes."
        </p>
        <p>"Fiction."</p>
        <p>Her perfectly carved brows drew together. "Yeah?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, if you must know, a lot of things are created from fictional
          works. Like transportation tubes, holophonor and the what-If machine
          in Futurama, 2000, DNA altering, Gattaca, 1997 said to help children
          not contact genetic diseases from parents. Skin-Healing patch from
          Aeon Flux, 2005. That one is self-explanatory." I said, expecting her
          to respond but she just stared. "I can understand why someone like you
          would mistake the serial killer genes for—don't give me that look,
          Sport."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What look?" She blinked, her eyes brighter than before, staring
          lustfully at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My index finger gestured in circles to her face. "<i>That</i> look."
        </p>
        <p>
          She grinned. "Your intelligence is a huge turn on, I'm not gonna lie.
          Besides only a creep would want to see my wardrobe."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took off my glasses, dropping them on top the book without taking my
          eyes off her. "If we want to talk about creeps, your name should be
          included on the list."
        </p>
        <p>
          She angled her body towards me, her nipples reflecting against the
          silk gown she wore as she got fully onto the bed, tilting her head and
          baring her neck for me to see how fucking suckable it was. "How so?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Turning on my night lamps, closing my windows and curtains, drawing
          my covers up my body as if you don't plan to kill me in the near
          future."
        </p>
        <p>
          She rose to her knees, fingers raking her hair back from her face.
          "You were shivering."
        </p>
        <p>"I never shiver."</p>
        <p>
          "And how would you know that? Do you set cameras around your room like
          a creep who loves to watch himself sleep after he wakes up?" She
          crawled to me, straddling my thighs and making breathing extremely
          difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you asking about cameras so you know which to take care of when
          you sneak into my room to slit my throat?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I already checked. There are no cameras or bugs. For a man who
          preaches about carefulness, you are very careless."
        </p>
        <p>"I am not. Getting killed in my sleep is one of my fantasies."</p>
        <p>She drew her body closer to mine, "Weirdo,"</p>
        <p>
          "Creep," I said, my voice hoarse as I allowed her the space to mess
          with me, loving how her long fingers brushed down my shoulders,
          stealing my breath with the warmth of each graze through my shirt.
        </p>
        <p>"Asshole," she whispered.</p>
        <p>"Greedy thief."</p>
        <p>Her lips found my ear. "Psycho killer." She bit my ear lobe.</p>
        <p>My lips parted. "Witch."</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled, bringing her face from my neck, her lips aligned with
          mine, a breath touch away from brushing, and then she whispered,
          "Whore,"
        </p>
        <p>My breathing fevered against her lips. "Slut."</p>
        <p>
          Her teeth clamped down on her bottom lip, fingers disappearing
          underneath my shirt, palms feeling stomach muscles, which flexed at
          the tantalizing burn from her touch.
        </p>
        <p>Her gaze locked with mine.</p>
        <p><i>Beautiful.</i></p>
        <p>
          I switched to Spanish. "You do not want me obsessed with you, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Funny," she also said in Spanish. "I was about to say the same
          thing."
        </p>
        <p>"De Verdad?" <i>Really? </i></p>
        <p>
          "Si, puedo ser realmente aterrador."
          <i>Yes, I can be really scary.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand moved to the back of her neck, fisting her hair, not enough to
          cause pain, but enough to bare her neck for my hungry tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am hungry," I whispered in the dialect. My tongue and teeth
          dragging up her collarbone to the top of her neck, below her ear,
          light brown skin feeding me in more ways than one. "But not for food."
        </p>
        <p>
          In a swift movement, I flipped us over until she was beneath me, back
          pressed to the bed, lust-filled eyes peering up at me.
        </p>
        <p>"It's all your fault," I said, tightening my grip on her hair.</p>
        <p>
          "What is..." She asked when I released my hold, watching me take one
          of her hands from underneath my shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Putting the idea of eating you out in my head," I answered, gesturing
          for her to keep her fingers up as I removed my rings one by one,
          slipping them down her fingers for safekeeping. "Now you'll have to
          hold these for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her chest heaved up and down in anticipation. "Thought you didn't like
          the mess?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Apparently, Sport, you have not been paying attention to the things I
          say to you."
        </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
        <p>"Do I need to fuck you to bring back your memories?"</p>
        <p>Her tongue traced down her bottom lip.</p>
        <p>My hand, free of the rings, was ready to inflict torture.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry, but the last thing I want to do right now is think." She
          said, frustration leeching to every rise and fall of her voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smile I allowed to curl at the side of my lips did not promise
          safety; it was created from the intentions buried deep inside my head,
          intentions that I finally felt comfortable putting into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes searched hers as I repeated my words from a few days ago. "I
          don't like a mess, Zahra, but I'll take yours any day."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, that reminder."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes..." I trailed off, gaze dropping to her lips, my heart thumping
          harshly, beyond eager to carry on. "Allow me to give you a chance to
          tap out now before it's too late," I said.
        </p>
        <p>The smile that touched her lips mirrored mine.</p>
        <p>"I never tap out, especially not from your challenge."</p>
        <p>
          I was amused yet again. Immensely impressed by her confidence. I
          titled my head, watching my living, breathing addiction as I
          responded, "That, Querida is one of the many reasons I like you."

          <b>A little addressing</b>: This is still an ongoing story, which
          means, I am still writing it, and a lot of things can come up in my
          life while writing it, things that would require me to take breaks,
          and withhold updates because--life stuff--I know it is hard to wait,
          but please refrain from leaving comments that make it sound like what
          I have to do in my life isn't important, that I should drop everything
          and write chapters. That's not how it works, my loves. I can't predict
          when I would need time off because anything can spring up at anytime.
          but I have always been consistent whenever it's time to update, I have
          never once disappointed, so it kind of hurts when I see comments that
          make it seem like I am not trying enough when I KNOW, that I am. I
          would advise, if you're used to reading complete books, you can
          archive this one until it is completed. it won't be long before it is.
          I'm planning 55-60 chapters for this story, and we're already at 42. I
          am also a reader, and sometimes (most times) I wait for the story to
          be completed before I read because waiting is kind of hard. (I know)
          Anyway, that's it! Hope you understand.

          Don't forget to vote and comment! As you know, your feedback is my
          writing fuel, and when I get it, I tend to write better, so SPAM the
          CRAZY out of me...Might be difficult--might--but please! I want to
          know every thought you get as you read!

          <b>ZAHRA FAIZAN'S </b>body was equivalent to a serum created to ignite
          a heavy dose of fever into a healthy body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warm, soft, and ready, this woman was mine for the taking. She was
          mine to own and claim tonight and as many as I saw fit. She didn't
          know it yet, but she signed away a lot the moment she agreed to my
          rule break. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My addiction had always been centered on want, and at first, I wanted
          Zahra; to be close to her, to hear her speak to me, but now, the need
          to touch her played with my reasoning. Nothing ever played with my
          reasoning. I was as focused as the word itself, and I should have
          pulled the plug when I realized she could toy with my control.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had me daring myself to act without thinking. I had never been
          careless, but she made carelessness seem like the new carefulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was blinded, and I was aware of this said blindness; I was also
          mindful of the fact that I was choosing to ignore it because it was
          reckless.
        </p>
        <p>This moment, here and now, was worth every risk of recklessness.</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were as bright as my desperation. Her brows, carved to
          perfection, had me admiring the smooth sweep of the hair lining them.
          An uncertain smile tugged at her lips. "You...like me," she stated.
        </p>
        <p>"Have my actions or my words shown anything otherwise that?"</p>
        <p>
          She chortled, "You having a fantasy of slitting my throat doesn't
          exactly spell how much you like me, sir."
        </p>
        <p><i>Sir.</i></p>
        <p>
          I had been addressed that way several times, but none made me feel
          so...disparate.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I like it," I stated, watching her face go from smug to interested.
        </p>
        <p>She raised a brow. "Like what?"</p>
        <p>"Sir. I like how you called me that."</p>
        <p>
          She raised her hand, her fingers disappearing into my hair, the
          feeling as exhilarating as the first time she performed that very
          action. "And I like how transparent you are with your emotions. It's
          new. Men are always—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "I don't care about what men always do. I feel it; I
          say it. Like I once told you, beating around the bush is for
          children."
        </p>
        <p>
          She smiled, eyes softening, fingers caressing my scalp. "The world
          would be chaos if everyone had the same reasoning as you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know." I leaned close to her until my nose was buried in the crook
          of her neck, my tongue strutting out to lick her warm skin before my
          lips sucked on the tender spot. I felt her body arch slightly from the
          bed, shuddering breath leaving her parted lips. Pride filled me. "I'm
          mostly this way because I crave the chaos," I muttered before moving
          higher, my tongue exploring before I left a bruise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her skin tasted promising; it lured in memories of how she tasted that
          night, how I'd almost lost it, wanting to taste every inch of her. My
          body felt like my heart only—at this moment—supplied boiling blood to
          every vein underneath my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an aching strain against my briefs, cursing the annoying
          realization that I still had my slacks on. But I loved the pleasuring
          pain created from the anticipation of making her moan and writhe
          beneath and atop me, making her brand this moment to memory for as
          long as she breathed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You keep leaving hickeys like that; some people might put two and two
          together." She said, voice breathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Their funerals if they have enough courage to voice their suspicion,"
          I mumbled as my hand brushed the side of her thighs, up to the curves
          of her hips, and then settling on her waist; Her nightgown creasing
          and lifting, exposing skin, and fueling my addiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved the way she tasted, the way she smelled, the little breaths
          that kept escaping her lips, the soft tugs she gave my hair when my
          lips traveled down her neck to her collarbone while my hand fisted the
          hem of her dress, pushing it up until her bare chest was left in full
          display for me; I allowed my eyes trail down her body, wondering how
          the fuck I had seen her for the first time and had zero attraction
          towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something changed. Maybe it was her smart mouth or those freckles
          scattered here and there on her skin, some covering scars, some
          forming constellations, some just being alone, waiting for a lover's
          kiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her body was meant to be worshipped—a religion to remain unseen to all
          but me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The red thong she wore was begging to be carelessly handled and ripped
          apart by me, but a light glint of metal drew my attention to her perky
          nipples, and my need to rip off her underwear was halted when I
          wrapped my lips around one pierced nipple. The metallic taste
          condemned me to a subject that answered silent commands from her moans
          of pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fucking loved the sounds she was making; it did unsanctified things
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My tongue swirled around the metal, sucking and drawing out a moan and
          a tug of my hair from her. My other hand moved from holding her gown
          to cupping her other breast, my thumb teasing her nipple as she held
          the dress up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I gave her nipple a punishing suck, and she hissed after I released
          her. I watched her lust-filled eyes regard me with flimsy malice.
        </p>
        <p>"Motherfucker." She cursed me.</p>
        <p>I squinted, "That's a far cry from; Sir or Dad."</p>
        <p>"It's not a far cry from asshole."</p>
        <p>
          My gaze moved to her shoulder, settling on the scar from my bullet on
          her skin. "That's a fine-looking scar." I reminded her.
        </p>
        <p>"I'll be sure to return the favor in the near future."</p>
        <p>"I like the way you keep making me look forward to the future."</p>
        <p>
          Before she could comment, I kissed the underside of her breast,
          feeling the fast beating of her heart as I pressed heated but
          feather-light kisses down her stomach. The moment I heard the hitch of
          her breath and the flinch flex of her stomach when my lips explored,
          my hand traveled ahead of my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Softly, I traced my finger along the hemline of the thong. I licked
          and pressed my lips into every contour of her stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          An overwhelming desire bellowed through me. I couldn't stop my hand
          from disappearing between her legs, touching her soft heat that begged
          for attention, attention that I was eager to give...then take
          away...and then give.
        </p>
        <p>
          You wouldn't blame me; I was curious to know what other names she
          would call me asides from, 'motherfucker' and 'asshole.'
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers took time to explore her waist before they trailed down to
          her core, cupping her soaked underwear, barely covered by the thong,
          while my lips kissed down her navel and to the line of the red
          material covering her from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lifted myself a little, reaching to pull it off her, and she helped,
          rising as I dragged the thong down her legs and throwing it to a
          corner where it won't disturb.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra was quick to take off her robe and then the night dress. "You
          really love being naked," I observed.
        </p>
        <p>"And you have too many clothes on."</p>
        <p>
          I went above her again, my eyes soaking in the pinkish bruise on her
          neck, before dragging my gaze back to hers. "Would you love to see my
          tattoos while we do this?"
        </p>
        <p>She smiled. "I don't have a problem with your tattoos."</p>
        <p>
          "You don't?" I asked. "The first time Casmiro saw it, he screamed like
          a girl. And don't think I didn't see the disdain in your eyes when you
          first saw them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't know what they meant," she said, her hand raising to stroke
          my cheek. "Now that I do, I want to study every stroke, every ink; I
          want to see it through your eyes, and asides from the tattoo, you have
          a good physic. Who wouldn't want to see that?"
        </p>
        <p>"Grace. She hated it."</p>
        <p>
          The immediate frown that touched her brows had me wondering what I had
          said wrong, but it was gone as soon as it came, replaced by a more
          sadistic smile as she cupped my chin, looking straight into my eyes.
          "Never speak of another woman when I'm naked and beneath you. My
          rule." She smiled, tilting her head and tugging me down to her, our
          lips nearly touching. "Is that clear...sir?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My cock hardened at the domineering tone of her voice, and I felt the
          urge to take control but, at the same time, let her have it so she
          could weld the knife and stir this.
        </p>
        <p>
          My knees drew up, separating her legs as I responded. "Yes, Ma'am."
        </p>
        <p>"Awesome,"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm," My palm pressed flat on her stomach, pushing her back down
          gently. "Now relax."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her teeth clamped on her bottom lip. "Why? You wanna take care of me?"
        </p>
        <p>"Whatever gave you that notion?"</p>
        <p>
          This time, the frown that touched her brows was plagued with
          confusion, one I reveled in as my hand traveled down her stomach to
          the wetness between her legs. I rubbed slowly at her swollen clit, wet
          and fucking soft to touch; I knew for a fact that I could play with
          that all day if nothing but to feel its softness on the pad of my
          fingers and to hear her breathy moans now erupting with a lust-filled
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>If my mind had a face, it would be grinning right now.</p>
        <p>
          I slapped her clit, and she gasped, eyes widening in surprise at the
          impact. I could only begin to imagine the pain and pleasure she got
          from that action.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze locked with hers, dropping to those lips, the bottom one
          swollen and red due to how hard she had bit it. I wanted to suck it,
          kiss her, and feel her tongue against mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I moved to stroke between her slit, spreading her wetness all
          around her core, I basked in the way her thighs shook, and I allowed
          my mind to drift off to how wonderful it had felt to kiss her, how
          intimate and connected I had felt to another person.
        </p>
        <p>The moment that sealed the deal for me.</p>
        <p>The moment she ruined afterward.</p>
        <p>
          I rubbed her clit, massaging the pulsing bud, earning small moans and
          whimpers from her, teasing and making her squirm in waiting to be
          filled up. I slipped a finger into her, and her walls immediately
          stuck to my finger, tight and pulsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck." she let out, her head pressing further into the pillow, eyes
          almost shut but still in a heated daze, looking at me while my finger
          worked its way inside her, curling and freeing, searching, seeking,
          and finding. She felt so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed in another finger, and she lifted her hips, her hand fisting
          my shirt around my shoulder, her walls clamping to them immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          This woman was naked before me, and I was still thinking of the next
          opportunity I would get to fuck her. It felt like the first time all
          over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hated how my body had never longed for anyone as much as it did for
          her. It made it seem like a first. I already have so many firsts with
          her. Things might not end well if we kept going at this pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          That right there—that thought—was my rational thinking, but
          unfortunately, I was now blinded by every irrational circumstance that
          came with being with this woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pumped my fingers in and out of her, and her body arched. I palmed
          her stomach, pressing her back to the bed, the sound of my strokes
          heightening and lessening, filling the space between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I added a third finger, stretching her. The hiss that left the space
          between her teeth was accompanied by a throaty moan that had her
          thighs quaking. "Mmm fuck, your fingers are..."
        </p>
        <p>"What."</p>
        <p>"Long...so fucking long."</p>
        <p>
          My lips fell to her nipple, hiding my smile as I satisfied my craving
          for another connection with her body, one I knew I couldn't get from
          kissing her. I flicked the erect bud with my tongue, twirling with the
          same pattern and pace my fingers fucked her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt warmth from inside her, and I knew she was close, the way her
          body gave in entirely to me, submitting as I increased my pace, the
          hilt of my palm slapping against her clit with each stroke.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck...Elio...I'm close."</p>
        <p>
          I maintained my pace, and she held the back of my neck, her hips
          lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I released her nipple, pressing my palm flat on her stomach, halting
          my movement and hers.
        </p>
        <p>"What the—"</p>
        <p>
          With three fingers still inside her, I stroked her clit with my thumb,
          circling the swell of her arousal sensually and shutting her up,
          letting her growing high dial back down into something torturingly
          sweet.
        </p>
        <p>
          She rolled her hips to the swirling of my thumb, probably enjoying it.
        </p>
        <p>I stopped.</p>
        <p>She whined. "Seriously, what-"</p>
        <p>
          My fingers moved inside her, thrusting at a faster pace than it had
          been before. Deeper until I felt her shiver when I touched that part
          of her that had her coming even before I fucked her the last time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hit that spot with each thrust. She squirmed beneath me, writhing
          and heaving, wholly undone.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit, please don't stop."</p>
        <p>I stopped.</p>
        <p>
          "Fucking hell, Elio. I swear to all things holy; I'll be slitting your
          throat before you get to slit—Mmph." She whimpered, then I pulled my
          hands out and dragged my fingers up and down her slit. "You don't plan
          on making me come, do you?"
        </p>
        <p>"I do. Just not through my fingers."</p>
        <p>"What—"</p>
        <p>
          I lifted myself off her. "I want to taste you. No—I apologize—I have
          been craving to taste you since that time in the car; I can barely
          control the urge."
        </p>
        <p>She blinked. "Then go ahead..."</p>
        <p>
          "I will. But I also remember when you told me you could get off on my
          face; I've wanted to test that theory."
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra's brows raised; her lips curled into a sly smile as her tongue
          ran down her bottom lip. "This is one of the rare moments I appreciate
          your attention to detail."
        </p>
        <p>"That so?"</p>
        <p>
          She nodded, quickly switching our positions until she was straddling
          me. "We really are a match made in hell."
        </p>
        <p>"A mistake."</p>
        <p>"One I'm pretty sure you're grateful for."</p>
        <p>"You think so highly of yourself."</p>
        <p>"No one else does, so I gotta do it for me."</p>
        <p>"I think highly of you," I told her, and it was the truth.</p>
        <p>She looked genuinely surprised. "You do?"</p>
        <p>"Hm. I like that you're smart. That you challenge me."</p>
        <p>
          Her hand moved to the hem of my shirt as she pulled it over my head,
          throwing it to the side. For the first time, I didn't focus on the
          mess we were making in my room, I was close to her, and she was the
          only thing that got my attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her fingers trailed my chest, and the tattoos visible from my arm.
          "I'm curious now; what else do you like about me?"
        </p>
        <p>"You complement my being."</p>
        <p>
          She nodded, looking impressed with my statement. "What else." She
          leaned in to kiss my throat, which bobbed at the contact.
        </p>
        <p>She was lighting a fire I had no desire to quench.</p>
        <p>"You're interesting."</p>
        <p>
          "What else?" her lips feathered down to my chest, licking me like
          there was vanilla etched to my skin.
        </p>
        <p>"You're beautiful, and I love your freckles and hair."</p>
        <p>
          I felt her smile against my skin before she looked up at me. "What
          else?" she asked again, dark eyes searching mine while my eyes
          memorized every speck of color in her iris.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You." I voiced and raised my hand, stroking her hair away from her
          face and tucking it behind her ear. "It's near impossible to pinpoint
          why I like you, Zahra. I have tried, denied it, and given it an
          overthought, but I can't find a specific reason. It's just you," my
          hand trailed down her arm to her forearm and then to the dip in her
          waist. "All of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her smile was small and genuine now. "I am wrong, Elio. My whole
          existence is wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My life is wrong; what would one more wrong do to the other boatload
          of wrongs?"
        </p>
        <p>She tilted her head, "It could tip you over."</p>
        <p>"Maybe that's exactly what I want."</p>
        <p>"Or maybe it's the sex talking; <i>maybe</i> you're delusional."</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to tell her not to downplay what I had just revealed, but I
          didn't. I was unknowingly giving her too many weapons, I didn't want
          to cross the limit, so I said. "Hm. Maybe."
        </p>
        <p>She grinned, the topic, forgotten.</p>
        <p>"Can I test my theory now?"</p>
        <p>
          She answered by moving, and I shifted further down as she got in line
          with my face; the sight of her glistening slit had me aching to be
          inside her. I had to remind myself that she wasn't here to gratify me;
          she was here so I could do the gratifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands latched onto the headboard, and mine went around both her
          thighs, pulling her down to my face as I licked between her slit,
          drawing my tongue up until I reached her clit and gave it a good suck.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mmmm." I groaned, loving the way she tasted,
          <i>like fucking addiction. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I sucked on her, twirling my tongue on her clit, French fucking
          kissing her pussy like it was the only kissable part in her body.
        </p>
        <p>"Ahnnn," she moaned, grinding on my face as I ate her out.</p>
        <p>
          My tongue flicked her throbbing bud a few times before I satisfied her
          with a deep suck that had her breath hitching in gasps as her moans
          grew louder. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I licked down her clit before strutting my tongue inside her, fucking
          her, licking her, sucking her, feeding the Zahra addict inside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved it. I love this. I want to do this every day. Every hour.
          Every fucking second.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck, it feels so good; you're doing so fucking good."</p>
        <p>
          The little praise had my grip tightening on her thighs as I relished
          in the taste and feel of her. I fucked her to unfinished sentences
          with each stroke of my tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her moans were loud, unrestrained as her thighs shook, and she was
          coming, her warm release filling my tongue as I drank and licked her
          clean of my torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want to stop, but her sighs sounded tired, and I allowed her
          the space to get off me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lifted myself to one of my elbows, watching her settle beside me,
          her head to the pillow, hair a mess as she blew out a breath and
          turned her head to look at me and then my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How are you so good with your tongue if you don't have sex often."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know. I'm glad you think I'm good. Want to do it again?"</p>
        <p>
          She laughed, the sound bubbling out of her in waves as she looked away
          from me, her eyes on the ceiling as the laugh died down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Usually, we like to recuperate," she said, turning her head to me
          again, "You know, catch our breath?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." I couldn't look away from her face as my hand went to her
          stomach, fingers grazing her skin.
        </p>
        <p>"You have a tub?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          "Awesome, I'd like to use it," she said, her hand raising while her
          fingers grazed my jaw. "Join me."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>She frowned. "No?"</p>
        <p>My eyes locked with hers. "I meant...I don't often use the tub,"</p>
        <p>"Let's go use it together."</p>
        <p>I shifted. "I don't want to."</p>
        <p>
          "Why?" she asked, lifting herself with an elbow, making my hand drop
          from her stomach. "Are you shy to get naked with me?"
        </p>
        <p>I drew a blank look.</p>
        <p>She chuckled. "What else do you want me to think?"</p>
        <p>
          I looked away from her, my hand grazing my ring on her finger. "I
          don't like too much...water...being under it. I only go under when
          I'm...." I trailed off.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, your fucked up father," she voiced into the heavy silence, but
          then a frown touched her brows. "But you were in the pool with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. That was because someone was drowning." I said. "I was
          distracted because you were there, and I was trying to drown you."
        </p>
        <p>"What if I promise this time would be different?"</p>
        <p>"It won't—"</p>
        <p>
          She scooted closer to me. "I'll be there, you'll be there, and there
          will be no drowning. Just me and you, in a tub...naked and wet."
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to suppress a groan, but I could see myself raising a white
          flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scene she had just pictured played in my head. It was fucking
          amazing, but the nervousness at the pit of my stomach refused to
          yield.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her finger trailed down my naked chest to my stomach. "What do you
          say?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't need to speak. The look in my eyes must have told her I was
          agreeing to it because she was pulling me out of bed to the bathroom
          with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, my nervousness wasn't as copious as the anticipation I
          felt when I saw her naked body standing right before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was beautiful, and I was privileged enough to be standing here
          right now.
        </p>
        <p>"You don't plan on entering with your pants, do you?"</p>
        <p>
          My gaze moved to the bathtub, and a small spike of nervousness rocked
          me. I didn't let it stay as I dragged my gaze back to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without overthinking it, I started to undo my belt, slipping it off
          and dropping it on the sink. I undid the buttons, zipped down, and
          slipped it off me before settling it on the sink too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra's teeth bit down on her bottom lip, stopping a smile as she took
          steps back towards the tub and motioned for me with her index finger
          to walk towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her turn on the water, and quickly, the tub began to fill
          up, the sound of the water numbing my senses for a second, but it
          became clear soon after when I watched Zahra step into the tub, big
          enough to fit two people.
        </p>
        <p>
          She released her teeth from her lips, letting a wide grin spring
          through. "It's like Dion's, but bigger." She tilted her head as the
          water rose to her stomach level. "You getting in?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her relax, her hand coming to caress her breast. "The water
          is a little bit cold; it needs you to keep it warm." She goofed.
          "Cause you're so hot."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Very mature," I stated, finally freeing myself from my briefs, my
          length free and very much erect. Despite my inhibitions about this
          tub, her body seemed to be all the distraction I needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She giggled like a child before she relaxed, resting her back at the
          tub's edge and closing her eyes as the water covered her chest and I
          stepped in, resting opposite her.
        </p>
        <p>
          My muscles coiled at the feel of being underwater without going under.
          I gripped both edges of the tub as if I wanted to jump out at any
          second. For a moment, I wanted to, but then Zahra's head went under
          the water, and I just watched. I could see her eyes closed underneath.
          She was holding her breath but still letting herself go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed my grip from the tub's edges, letting my hands fall into the
          water, just when Zahra came back up for air, her hands pulling her
          hair from her face as she smiled at me. "It's cool underwater. You
          should try it."
        </p>
        <p>"I should have known this was a ploy to drown me."</p>
        <p>
          She laughed. "No, it's not. It's a ploy to tell you that being
          underwater doesn't have to be a death sentence. Think about it: you
          wouldn't be alive if it were to be one. You would have died the first
          time your dad tried to 'baptize' you."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "I didn't die because he didn't want me dead."</p>
        <p>"So why is it a death sentence to you."</p>
        <p>"It's not."</p>
        <p>
          She raised a brow, moving closer to me, her legs grazing mine. "Right.
          But you refrain from getting underwater because...."
        </p>
        <p>"To punish myself."</p>
        <p>She nodded, "Why would you punish yourself?"</p>
        <p>"I fuck up sometimes."</p>
        <p>
          "We all fuck up sometimes, but we don't punish ourselves in our
          bathtubs, not unless we're a little crazy in the head."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not crazy." I gritted.</p>
        <p>"But you call yourself a psychopath."</p>
        <p>"There's a distinction."</p>
        <p>"Is there?"</p>
        <p>My jaw clenched. "Is there a point to this conversation?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," she drew even closer to me. "You claim not to be crazy, your
          father treated you like a crazy person, and you're still following his
          methods. You're proving him right."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          She straddled me, my cock pressing against her stomach underneath the
          water; she cupped my face in her hands, clear brown eyes looking
          directly into mine, wet lashes making them seem like she was in a
          daze. "I'm trying to make you see that it's all in your head. It's
          embedded deep in your mind, and you have strange beliefs and
          affirmations you were made to believe. I don't know how the bastard
          did it, but I know one thing,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She lifted herself, her hand wrapping around my cock in the water,
          stroking me once before guarding me to her entrance and sinking on my
          length. My heart pumped blood faster than ever before; I could hear
          the fucking sound of the thumping in my ears.
        </p>
        <p>My lips parted, and her whimper reigned.</p>
        <p>
          She smiled, her thumb stroking my cheek. "You and I? We're alike in so
          many ways. That's how I know you're strong, that's how I know you
          can't be scared of getting into a fucking bathtub, that's how I know
          that this fear you feel is all in your head."
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands landed on her hips as she moved against me, riding my cock in
          the sweetest way possible, pulling out a groan from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You fell in that pool with me," she breathed, rocking her hips. "I'm
          sure as hell you didn't think about the water when you spoke to me
          seconds after you came up for air. It wasn't because you wanted to
          drown me. It was because you didn't think."
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand moved from her hips to the small of her back, aiding her
          movements as she rode me, rolling her hips in a circular motion that
          had my head spinning.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You were too focused on me. Not the water. You didn't punish yourself
          then. You punished me. Now you're not punishing me; you're fucking
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," My chest heaved out the sound, her tight walls hugging my cock
          in an intense vice as she rocked back and forth, her back aching
          skillfully as my hips lifted to meet her strokes, drawing out a moan
          from her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her soft lips kissed the underside of my ear. "The problem
          here...isn't the water or the tub; it's your thoughts, your mind." She
          whispered before raising her head and locking gazes with me. "Let me
          be your only thought,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She was my only thought; the water or the tub was the last thing on my
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were going slow...this moment was therapeutic and intimate. I
          pulled her closer, her pelvis rubbing against mine as she rode me,
          feverish breaths escaping both our lips, gazes locked, the lust and
          intensity in her eyes luring my release to the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Feel me," she whispered, hand cupping my neck and the underside of my
          left ear. "Feel only me, see only me. Forget your old memories from
          this tub. Make a new one of me riding your cock, looking into your
          eyes, telling you how fucking pretty they are when filled with lust
          for me. Only me, only Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"Only you."</p>
        <p>"Yes," she moaned.</p>
        <p>
          My skin heated up, her movement dialing up, riding me with the intent
          to get off; our lips were parted, breathing through our mouths, said
          breaths mingling to form the most intoxicating sound I'd ever heard.
        </p>
        <p>She was divine. This was divine. This was everything.</p>
        <p>"Fuck, Sport, I love being inside you."</p>
        <p>
          Her other hand came around my shoulder, hugging me as her hips rocked
          with mine, a rhythm created by a connection I never thought I would
          feel with another human being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always thought I was a man without feelings. No—I had believed the
          projection people had imbued in me about not having feelings. I
          thought it to the extent that it took a great deal to make me feel
          something—anything.
        </p>
        <p>But right now, all I was doing was feeling.</p>
        <p>
          Her skin melded with mine, a blend that gave the word 'perfect' a run
          for its money. Her moans and mine highlighted to speak languages to
          the ears of the very element that fueled our attraction. The thumping
          of my heart followed the same rhythm as hers. A rhythm that spelled
          eagerness, intimacy, lust, and need.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came with a groan, the same time her hips pressed around me tightly,
          and her release joined mine, a high we were climbing together, the
          feeling weakening every bone in my damn body as hers fell flatly on
          mine, our breathing the only thing to be heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          This woman had just ripped up a page in my book, taking the liberty to
          write her own paragraphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stand corrected; Zahra Faizan's body was equivalent to a serum
          created to ignite a strong dose of fever into a healthy body.
        </p>
        <p>
          This healthy body being mine, and this fever, too far gone to be
          cured. <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>I MAY </b>have overdone it.</p>
        <p>
          Trickery and Manipulation were my things, but it had never gotten to
          the point where I'd use this particular skill to help someone else.
          Especially not someone like Elio Marino, who saw words as
          affirmations. Passing the wrong notion might be terrible, but if I was
          honest with myself, would it still be considered wrong if I actually
          wanted to do it because I cared?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not really. But denial was sweeter than acceptance. We might be alike,
          but I sure as hell am not ready to confront my conflicting feelings,
          at least not when my intentions are a little...sideways.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a benefit, though. Having him by my side was for the best.
          It was better to be in the good graces of this man than the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I had come to learn in this game was that trusting impulsive
          and unpredictable people could lead to your downfall; so yes, I didn't
          trust him, and he didn't trust me too, but there was a truce somewhere
          in the middle, and I had to admit that it was better than nothing at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were settled back on his bed, and I'd dressed up again; after
          wanting to bolt, immediately I had my clothes on, but then I
          remembered dinner, which was not as hot as it was when I first brought
          it, but it was warm enough to be eatable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't cost me a second to leave it all for Elio to eat, but I was
          hungry too, and I never say no to food, no matter how awkward the
          situation might be—Whom am I kidding—I was more uncomfortable because
          the situation wasn't awkward, Elio was quiet, on his phone, looking
          relaxed than he had been before I got here.
        </p>
        <p><i>I was the problem. </i></p>
        <p>
          I didn't deal with aftermaths, and our aftermath wasn't supposed to be
          so...comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened the bowl I'd put the food in. The smell of fried potatoes,
          Sauce, garlic, and something that could only be described as whatever
          Dog's secret ingredient was, filled my nostrils and transported me to
          a setting where food was the main character, and humans were automatic
          ads for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          His Patatas Bravas was his brand signature, my personal favorite after
          his Pasta and show-stopping Tortillas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio dropped his phone by the side, looking into the bowl with a
          surprised glint in his eyes. "Hm. Impressive."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took in a deep breath with my eyes closed, a smile spreading on my
          lips as I opened my eyes again, hypnotized by the aroma and
          garnishing. "Food prepared by my best friend, Dog. Always phenomenal,
          one bite changes your life, never to be eaten for free because we at
          STREET believe <i>nothing</i> this good should come easy and one day,
          <i>one day</i> we will have our own restaurant, with Dog being the
          chef and all members of STREET getting access to eat for free for the
          rest of our lives and we would make history, endless meals, endless—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I believe I have gotten your point now." he cut me off, and the
          imaginary soundtrack in my head seized. I rolled my eyes, the moment
          gone. I proceeded to pass him a fork.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My mother loved this dish," He said, "She never prepared it, but she
          had this recipe book. Patatas Bravas was highlighted with a pen."
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," I said, shoving my fork into a potato and then a small beef and
          some of the sauce, raising it to my view. "Then let's eat this with
          her, ja?" I grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know how that would work. She's been dead for years." He
          stated.
        </p>
        <p>My grin died. "Jesus—you know what I meant, you blunt fuck."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh." He said, but then went quiet with a frown before his brows went
          up. "You meant that in a literal sense."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "Something tells me many people have died because you
          thought their statements weren't literal."
        </p>
        <p>
          He dipped his fork into a piece of potato, "You're probably right." He
          ate the potato, eyes lightening up a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ate it too, and I almost melted on the spot. It tasted like a good
          orgasm. My mind literally took a second to fly into space and back.
          "So <i>delicious</i>!" I moaned. "What do you think?"
        </p>
        <p>He shrugged. "It's not bad."</p>
        <p>
          My frown was immediate. "Not bad? Do you have...hold on," I reached
          for his phone with unimaginable speed, about to tell him to unlock it
          when it opened on its own. Upon his not stopping to question me, I
          searched for the safari icon<i> </i>and, on the search bar, typed
          out:<i> </i
          ><b
            ><i
              >'What's it called when someone doesn't have a sense of taste</i
            ></b
          ><b>?'</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The results filed out, and my frown deepened. "How the fuck is this
          shit pronounced? Ageu—wi-usia?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ageusia." He corrected fluently, taking his phone from my hand and
          dropping it beside him. "My sense of taste is perfect."
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt offended for Dog's talent. "If it were perfect, you wouldn't
          refer to this awesomeness between us as 'not bad'. You should be
          jailed for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He took another one into his mouth while nodding at my statement. "I
          never said it was bad."
        </p>
        <p>"You didn't say it was good either."</p>
        <p>"Baseless argument."</p>
        <p>"I swear you—"</p>
        <p>
          "Keep talking, and I'll finish it all," He lined his fork with three
          potatoes and almost all the sauce before shoving it into his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck—"</p>
        <p>
          He was diving for another round, determined actually to finish it all.
        </p>
        <p><i>I'll show him. </i></p>
        <p>
          I shoved my own fork in, stabbing in as many potatoes as I could
          carry, alongside portions of beef, shoving it all in my mouth. It got
          so full that I had to use my other hand to support my jaw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio had taken two more forks full during my struggle. I had the urge
          to scream, but my mouth was too full, and it wasn't easy to chew. The
          man was eating like he was the only one destined to eat from the bowl
          like it would help stop the apocalypse or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few minutes of me trying to swallow and fill up my fork at the
          same time, the bowl was almost empty.
        </p>
        <p><i>No, this won't do. </i></p>
        <p>
          This time, he didn't take any potato because there were only a few
          left; his focus was on the beef, I didn't know how he did it, but he
          managed to gather almost everything inside his fork, but when he took
          it up and into his mouth, I grabbed the bowl quickly and got off the
          bed to the far corner of the room as I managed to swallow. "You're a
          fucking food bully; what the fuck!" I shot with a glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't like sharing." He said, bringing the fork in line with his
          mouth as his tongue came out to lick the metal, somehow making me feel
          jealous of the non-living thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got a hold of myself. "It was <i>my</i> food that <i>I</i> decided,
          out of the <i>kindness</i> of my very <i>subtle</i> heart, to share
          with you. <i>My</i> food. I should be the one to eat most of it."
        </p>
        <p>"You speak as though your name was carved into the bowl."</p>
        <p>
          "Never again. I'll never eat with you again; you're one of those kids
          with wide mouths and throats, always bringing the biggest spoon so
          they could eat more than the little people. That is mean no one should
          do shit like that."
        </p>
        <p>Amusement danced in his eyes. "I was eating like I normally do."</p>
        <p>
          I scoffed. "And he calls me an animal; you're a beast, the worst of
          your kind, fucking asshole."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio chuckled, getting off the bed while I hugged the bowl to my chest
          possessively.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Relax, let's get water in the kitchen; I'm full; the rest is yours."
        </p>
        <p>"You ate almost everything; there's no...<i>rest</i>."</p>
        <p>He dished me a disapproving look. "Follow me,"</p>
        <p>
          We reached the kitchen some minutes later, and he washed the fork he
          used before getting himself and me some water and settling on a stool
          opposite me.
        </p>
        <p>"Thanks for dinner." He said, "Both dinners."</p>
        <p>I gave him a fake wide smile, getting on a stool. "Real smooth."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He said, ring-free fingers thumping on the table, baiting his
          time to ask me a question.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sneaked a glance at him as I ate the last bit from the bowl, not
          nearly enough to make me satisfied. "What is it?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm curious." He said. "How many languages do you know?"</p>
        <p>
          I picked up the cup, bringing it to my lips before speaking. "Nine." I
          drank a few gulps before dropping the glass back down. "Italian,
          Spanish, English, French, Korean, Russian, Vietnamese, Polish, and
          Mandarin."
        </p>
        <p>"How did you learn?"</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "I was little. As you've seen in your background check, we
          didn't have a normal school where I grew up. But our guardian was a
          linguist. When I had the chance to study more, I decided to focus on
          languages. There's just something beautiful about speaking and knowing
          that not everyone around you understands. You could be selling off
          someone, and they'd be smiling and thanking you."
        </p>
        <p>He nodded. "It's a good skill."</p>
        <p>I smiled. "Gracias."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>"Well, I should get going; it's midnight."</p>
        <p>
          His brows drew down at that. "Just stay; leave when the day is
          brighter."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, can't do that," I blurted out. "There's no staying overnight in
          this arrangement."
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned like he didn't like what I just said. "We don't have to do
          anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          I forced out a laugh, giving him a wary stare. "What, you want me to
          stay back so we can...<i>cuddle?</i>" At 'cuddle,' I made an irritated
          expression, anything to show him we weren't there and would never be
          there.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't respond.</p>
        <p>"Pfft, get real, Elio. That's never going to happen."</p>
        <p>
          He shifted like he was uncomfortable. "I don't know where your mind
          traveled to, but no. I recall the other day in Turin, you mentioned
          this tv show about a morning star, and I—" he stopped abruptly,
          looking for ways to frame his words. "I have a cinema room, we could
          watch it since I'm not well-versed in the entertainment world, and you
          seem to be an expert."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, completely frozen, while I watched him, my stomach
          flipping. Unannounced. I wouldn't have been able to stop the way the
          pace of my heartbeat had increased because it seemed as though this
          man...Elio Marino...The Wicked...incapable of feelings, never smiles,
          never had a girlfriend, didn't often have sex, psycho killer, wanted
          to spend time...with, me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if I succumbed, accepting that he wanted to spend time with me,
          there was still the fact that, for some reason, I wanted to spend time
          with him too. I bought the idea.
        </p>
        <p><i>Why the fuck am I buying the idea? </i></p>
        <p>Backtrack, Zahra, backtrack.</p>
        <p>
          I gathered the bowl, his fork, and my fork. "Right...that sounds cool,
          but I'm gonna have to pass. I might doze off, and I don't want to have
          to answer questions from STREET about why I'm coming from the front
          door and not my bedroom, so...."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay." He stated, watching me with purposeful indifference.</p>
        <p>"Yeah...but you can totally go and watch it alone—"</p>
        <p>"I'll read." He cut me off.</p>
        <p>"Cool."</p>
        <p>"Hm." </p>
        <p>"See you in the morning or...whenever."</p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          I gave another awkward nod and then turned on my heel. I could still
          feel his eyes on me, but I didn't look back. I couldn't. 
        </p>
        <p>If I did, I might have succumbed and stayed.</p>
        <p>And that was an action I couldn't and shouldn't be taking.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          <b>I WAS</b> probably making a mistake not informing Angelo's people
          of this new development. Still, I needed to see it for myself, find
          the original painting first and be one step ahead before letting their
          people in on the intel. This might sever any trust we had so far
          formulated with them, but we worked better without supervision, and
          this was the first legit lead we'd gotten in months; we couldn't risk
          sharing that intel with people who might be careless with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was why we were staking outside a school close to the warehouse,
          Dog with binoculars on his eyes as we waited for the guards to change
          shifts again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil and I remained in the back seat of the SUV we had taken out
          while Dog and Chika were in the front seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'd waited a week to head out, dishing out a perfect excuse for our
          movement; it was a bonus that we'd garnered a little bit of freedom
          working for, no—<i>with</i>—Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk and Upper had stayed back, but they were in our ears and also had
          eyes on us, thanks to the direct chain Upper had created from the
          surveillance cameras around this area and the whole district back to
          our quarter in the Marino compound.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had a solid plan to infiltrate the building. It was late in the
          afternoon, schools were very close to ending for the day, and I
          silently prayed that they changed shifts again when all the students
          had closed from school. Although we had tried to master their shift
          change, it didn't have any order, so it was difficult to place a set
          time frame. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The warehouse was not a warehouse. It was a small company that
          produced socks—that was the cover-up for the paintings being shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, Arturo's great-grandfather had attended this school by the
          side when he was just little; no one knew this because, according to
          Chika, Arturo's great-grandfather hadn't spent more than three weeks
          in the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I squared my shoulder, looking to my side to find Devil's quiet gaze
          on the weapon he held. I bumped my shoulder into him, and he flinched,
          looking over at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tapped my comm, turning it off while indicating that he turned his
          off. When he did, I spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You good?" I said into the space between us, not wanting our other
          companions in the car to get wind of it.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, why?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because you don't seem like you're good. You've been quiet all week."
        </p>
        <p>He looked away from me. "I'm fine."</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to drop it. That was the cue to drop it, but I decided to
          press. "You know you can talk to me."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah."</p>
        <p>"Then talk to me."</p>
        <p>
          His lips went into a thin line as he looked out the window, like
          sitting beside me was suffocating him. "There's nothing to talk to you
          about."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like how difficult he could get sometimes, bottling up his
          thoughts and dying safely in silence. It was unhealthy.
        </p>
        <p>"Devil, I know we—"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at me with dark eyes showing how badly he wanted me to stop
          trying to get to him. "I am fine," he said. "Just don't have a good
          feeling about this. It seems too easy, and you're not seeing it, or
          listening to me, so I'm fine; we're following your lead."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed. "I get it; you don't like this—"</p>
        <p>"You're working on your own terms. We're supposed to be a team."</p>
        <p>"Everyone agreed to it." I frowned.</p>
        <p>
          "Because you forced it on them, you gave no room for any other
          opinion, acted like you have some other personal shit to deal with."
        </p>
        <p>I looked up at the rearview to catch Chika's gaze on us.</p>
        <p>
          I looked back at Devil and said quietly, "We're doing this for us, for
          our freedom."
        </p>
        <p>
          "A freedom we already have?" he raised his hand, "Look around; we're
          fucking free."
        </p>
        <p>"Devil—"</p>
        <p>
          "Maybe next time, leave room for other opinions because this isn't
          your 'freedom' alone; it's for everyone in STREET. Something is going
          to go so fucking wrong today, I feel it in my gut, and all casualties
          will be your fault because you choose to blindly trust a stranger than
          the people you've lived with for years."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not—"</p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Dog turned his head to the backseat. "I'm going out for a
          smoke. Zahra you coming? Monitor me and shit?" he stared at me
          pointedly.
        </p>
        <p>"I'll be right out."</p>
        <p>He glanced at Devil and then left the car.</p>
        <p>
          I turned to Devil again. "Just trust me, okay? I know what I'm doing."
        </p>
        <p>His stare was blank. "Right, you always do."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed, opening my mouth to say something, but thought better of it,
          deciding to get out of the car. My leather pants stretched as I closed
          the door and walked to the back of the vehicle seeing Dog leaning
          against the trunk.
        </p>
        <p>"What." I snapped.</p>
        <p>
          He turned off his comm and lit the cigarette between his lips. "He's
          right, you know? Keep going at this pace, and you'll run whatever race
          you're running alone."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, so you're the reasonable one now."</p>
        <p>"Don't pick a fight with me; I'm tryna' help."</p>
        <p>
          I leaned on the trunk right beside him, staring at the school bus by
          the side. "I'm not running any race."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But you're going faster than we normally do; we might be unable to
          keep up."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, clenching my jaw. "I just feel guilty."</p>
        <p>"For what?"</p>
        <p>
          "For this," I said with a sigh, gesturing around us with my hands.
          "All of this."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me with a frown. "What's there to feel guilty for? We all
          want this gold. We all want to go after it. As fucked up as it sounds,
          we love our new home too. No one's complaining."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What about the vacation? Taking a break from stealing, traveling
          around the world, giving Milk her American dream? All our plans, cut
          short, just like that. If I hadn't thought it was a good idea to steal
          from Marino, we might be on some faraway island, drunk off our asses
          in some fancy beach house, wearing nothing but colorful bikinis with
          dried puke at the side of your lips because you can't hold your damn
          liquor."
        </p>
        <p>He laughed. "Yeah, that's fucking accurate."</p>
        <p>
          "I know." I smiled, but it died down as quickly as it came. "I just
          feel like if we can do this, find the gold, and the flash drives,
          we'll be set for life; we wouldn't have to steal or commit crimes. We
          could do whatever we want, go wherever we want, marry a stranger in
          Las Vegas, and laugh about it the next day."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But we don't have to rush." He said, looking down at me as he threw
          the cigarette away. "We don't have to lose track of ourselves. If
          we're careful, we'll have a lifetime to fuck with life."
        </p>
        <p>Something twisted at the pit of my stomach. "Yeah."</p>
        <p>
          "Awesome, so fucking take us along. We work better when we do shit
          together. With Devil's gut, your determination, Milk's charm, Upper's
          smartness, and my fuckery, we got this."
        </p>
        <p>I allowed a smile to curl against my lips. "Yeah. You're right."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, looking around us. "Perfect timing, 'cause some other car
          just came by."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What?" I followed his line of vision, spotting the matte black car
          with all-black tinted windows.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit, turn on your comms." Dog urged.</p>
        <p>
          Upper and Milk's voices filled my ears when I pressed the small
          button.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Guys! Get the fuck out of there; it was a bloody trap!"</i> Upper
          yelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Why aren't they responding?" </i> Milk's worried voice filtered at
          the moment I locked gazes with Dog.
        </p>
        <p>Fucking hell.</p>
        <p>
          Dog and I both turned to return to the car, but Devil was already
          coming out, disarmed, hands in the air as Chika followed through,
          holding a gun to Devil's head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grabbed my gun from the holster, pointing it right at Chika while
          Dog did the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The fuck, Chika? You're a bad guy?" Dog sounded genuinely surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm cosplaying as Guy from Free Guy; how the fuck did none of you see
          that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I knew Saucy Chika was sus; the dad pants didn't suit your whole
          persona." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, whatever; you're surrounded, so drop your weapons, or I'll blow
          his brains out," Chika said.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Bloody fuck."</i>  Upper's voice rang through.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait." Dog said, "I have a question. Do you really have a job in
          London where they sexualize your names?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. God, no." Chika said, looking like he was surprised we were
          having this conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog blinked. "Oh, so that means no one has done it yet. Folks, we can
          make my future restaurant with that theme; it would rock so hard; we
          could go all dark, maybe not like the dad pants costume, something
          sexy?"
        </p>
        <p><i>"Could work; I like it."</i> Milk said.</p>
        <p>
          "It would totally sell in a city like Miami? Oh fuck, the beaches and
          titties."
        </p>
        <p>
          "A valid reason for the exposing outfits since it's Miami," I added.
          "No one would question it."
        </p>
        <p>"What is happening right now," Chika asked.</p>
        <p><i>"What would you call it, though?"</i> Upper asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Probably something sexy too, attractive to the eyes. Itsy, bitsy,
          titty." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>"Too wordy," I said.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, guys, I don't think this is the right time for this
          conversation," Devil spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh right, there's a gun pointed at your head." Dog said. "Where were
          we? Lost track back there with the whole future plan thing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Chika looked just about ready to explode. "You all are just like him.
          Never taking me seriously, and they ask me why I grew up with so much
          malice."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay, Daddy issues, you got a problem, blow your brains out and go
          settle it in hell with daddy dearest; we don't give a shit; you either
          drop your weapon or—"
        </p>
        <p>
          More cars pulled in, drawing our attention, but staying clear away
          from people and the school just by the side. Men in black coveralls
          got out of them, guns in hands, pointing right at us.
        </p>
        <p>Chika smiled, eyes coming to settle on me. "You're done, STREET."</p>
        <p>
          My grip on the gun tightened, gaze burning into Chika's. "It seems
          like you have a death wish."
        </p>
        <p>
          "One that would be transferred to you and your man friend if you don't
          drop your weapons and do as we say."
        </p>
        <p>"Man friend? Who says <i>man friend</i>?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not fucking around!" Chika yelled like a psycho. "I'll shoot
          him." Chika vibrated with anger.
        </p>
        <p>"Nah, you're a chicken; you can't do it." Dog taunted.</p>
        <p>
          Chika angled his gun towards Dog and pulled the trigger; the sound of
          the bang was so sharp that the comm in my ear gave a sharp sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck!" Dog staggered back, his shirt torn from the graze of the
          bullet, blood seeping out of the wound; he glared at Chika. "You'll
          pay for that, motherfucker."
        </p>
        <p>
          Chika directed the gun to the back of Devil's head again. "The next
          one goes right into his brain; I won't miss."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gritting my teeth hard, I gestured to Dog to drop his weapon while I
          slowly dropped mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three men took the liberty of cuffing our hands in front of us,
          denying us free movement, and probably straining Dog's wound, based on
          how he winced.
        </p>
        <p>
          He pushed Devil to us, but the guy in question righted himself and
          turned to Chika. "Why agree to help if you had your motive? Why stage
          your own kidnap?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Chika's gaze fell on me, and he smirked. "I guess I learned a little
          thing from Arturo. Who doesn't love the dramatics?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why bring us out here at all? Contacting us when you could have
          gotten all the paint pieces on your own?" Devil asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "STREET," Chika said, "Shadows of Italy. Running around the world
          looking for the original painting. I gotta say, I was disappointed;
          y'all didn't know shit about it."
        </p>
        <p>"Yet you told us."</p>
        <p>
          "The original is not amongst the ones stored here." He said, a twinge
          of annoyance in his voice. "I have spent years searching for this
          shit. To think Arturo wasn't kind enough to let me in on the quest
          after years of ignoring me during his scheming. The gold, all that
          money, and the flash drives fucking belong to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Daddy didn't leave a Will, so you decided to be delusional and make
          yours." Dog egged him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, shut the fuck up! He left the quest. He wanted me to find it."
          His glare pinned on me. "Not you, Zahra. And not Marino."
        </p>
        <p>"You've been following us," Devil noted.</p>
        <p>
          "You lot have been the only ones to make real progress. I thought
          there would be something; maybe if I helped, I'd get a piece of that
          information too. But I was wrong. I would make sure none of you ever
          know shit. Because I won't let it happen."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would think before acting if I were you. Measure your options. Know
          who rules the city you're in."
        </p>
        <p>The man dared to laugh. "Oh, I know all right. Do I look scared?"</p>
        <p>
          I didn't look away from him as I let a smile kick up at the corner of
          my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          His amusement died a little as he swallowed. "You're about to go on a
          forever trip. Move." He gestured for us to head back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil's gaze met mine, asking a silent question. I shook my head. He
          looked just about ready to go against my wishes anyway, but he held
          himself back as we moved back.
        </p>
        <p>"Turn around," Chika demanded.</p>
        <p>"Got a thing for ass, Sauce boy?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p><i>"Dog quit it." </i>Milk snapped.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Should we contact Angelo's people? We didn't exactly have a backup
            plan."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Don't contact anyone," I said as we turned around.</p>
        <p>"Move," Chika urged.</p>
        <p><i>"We don't know what he has planned."</i> Milk said.</p>
        <p>"We've survived worse."</p>
        <p>"I don't like this." Devil gritted, and I looked over at him.</p>
        <p>"Trust me."</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, turning away from me as we walked towards the
          school bus, in time to see two men in black jumping down from it and
          another man lying face down on the ground, fingers shaking. It was no
          argument that he was the bus driver.
        </p>
        <p><i>No.</i></p>
        <p>My footsteps faltered.</p>
        <p>"I have an extraordinary plan for you, STREET."</p>
        <p>"Why does he keep saying our name like that?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          We ignored him as we stopped in front of the bus. "Get in. All three
          of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          We exchanged glances amongst ourselves before I looked back at Chika.
          "What are you doing?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Get the fuck in!" Chika yelled.</p>
        <p>
          With a grunt, Dog went in first, mindful of his shoulder, with a rough
          assist from one of the men holding us hostage. <br />
        </p>
        <p>"Ah shit," Dog cursed.</p>
        <p>
          Devil climbed in next, and I followed behind, seeing why Dog had
          cursed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bus was filled with children, scared and wide eyes staring right
          at us.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head snapped towards Chika, who had a smug smile, taking two steps
          back from the bus. "What the fuck is this?" I seethed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't answer, but he gestured to Devil. "You. Start up the engine,
          and drive."
        </p>
        <p>"With my cuffed hands?" Devil glared.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm pretty sure you can manage." Chika said, "We've tested the
          theory, don't worry."
        </p>
        <p>
          With a flare in his nostrils, Devil got to the driver's seat after
          stealing one glance at the children on the bus.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you playing at? Let the kids go!" I yelled.</p>
        <p>"It's all part of the game, sweet."</p>
        <p>"Don't fucking bring children into this, you bastard."</p>
        <p>
          He dipped his hand into his pocket, pulling out a small remote.
          "There's a bomb in the bus, just by your right."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered to the beeping device by the first passenger seat.
        </p>
        <p>"Bro, what the fuck?" Dog bent to inspect it.</p>
        <p>"It's a very special bomb, you see." He smiled.</p>
        <p>"This isn't funny, Chika." My voice shook.</p>
        <p>
          "You don't drive; it goes boom, you drive, it counts and eventually
          goes off, but still gives you an hour's worth minutes to count your
          friggin' blessings."
        </p>
        <p>"Let the kids go."</p>
        <p>
          "You stop driving; it goes off. You drive too slowly to preserve fuel;
          the time reads faster; you drive too fast to the authorities; it reads
          even faster. Either way, it'll go off but will buy us enough time to
          be out of sight."
        </p>
        <p>"You're fucking crazy bringing innocent children into this!"</p>
        <p>"How else will I make you sweat...Faizan."</p>
        <p>"You bastard."</p>
        <p>
          "I'd better start driving if I were you!" Chika yelled to Devil. He
          clicked a button on the remote, and a beeping sound went off inside
          the bus, the cries of panic from the children, not more than 10-12
          years, filled the bus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at the bomb; the time was reading faster, going down by
          seconds.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit, Devil, drive!" Dog yelled.</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck." Devil cursed, stepping on the gas, as one of the men slammed
          the bus door shut, leaving me staring at Chika's smirking face while
          he raised his hand in a slow wave, and the bus started to move
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Permission to contact Angelo's people, Zahra; that shit doesn't
            sound funny," </i
          >Upper said with an edge to his voice as the bus pulled into the road,
          past the car we brought to the scene.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't contact anyone."</p>
        <p>"You gotta be fucking kidding me." Devil gritted out.</p>
        <p>
          "What on God's fucking earth do you suggest we do then?" Dog looked as
          angry as Devil sounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze landed on the children. Scared stares locked to my form like
          they were also waiting for my following statement.
        </p>
        <p>I looked back at the bomb, the beeping going steady now.</p>
        <p>
          "Devil drives, You try to talk to the kids without swearing at them;
          Upper, Milk, and I will play with the wires on that thing until it
          stops beeping, and we remain breathing afterward."
        </p>
        <p>"That doesn't sound like a solid solution." Dog said.</p>
        <p>"You got anything better?" I asked, glancing at him and Devil.</p>
        <p>Silence reigned, and then I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "Awesome," I looked back at the bomb. "We stay calm, and then we get
          to work."<br /><br /><br />

        <p>
          Zahra saying no to Elio's request that they spend the rest of the
          night together, what do you think of this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like that, we're back on track with a little action! How do you
          think STREET will get out of this one?
        </p>
        <p>Chika's betrayal? did you see that coming?</p>
        <p>
          Zahra wanting to not involve Angelo's people even when things went
          sideways, what do you think is her motive?
        </p>
        <p>
          Chika calling Zahra by her last name even when no one but Elio's
          people, and people in her past knows it, do you think there's
          something there?
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparantly, Devil and Elio share the same gut tingle, they need to get
          their shit together and reconcile, don't they? but then--Zahra and
          Elio's little secret....
        </p>

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>GEMMA PARISI'S </b>house was normal.</p>
        <p>
          A modest bungalow in a neighborhood that was exceptionally peaceful.
          The lawn was neatly mowed, projecting attention to the white picket
          fence that stood unblemished, just like the building, which still
          stood out in the dark sky-blue and white paint design, along with the
          beautiful flowers that lined the corners of the house. It brought me
          to the realization that this house was either just remodeled or just
          built. Her red car was parked right in front of the black,
          tinted-windows minivan I had brought.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze checked along the corners of the house, the little pathways
          leading to the other street at the back. All clear. No suspicious
          movements. Or arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>Just like the woman I had come to see.</p>
        <p>
          The woman who would instead invite a mere acquaintance to her house
          rather than meet at a public restaurant where people could see if
          something were to go wrong inauspiciously.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sucked in the almost burnt-out cigar, allowing it to warm my chest
          while I quenched the lit edge and blew out the smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing my gaze from the house, I looked down at the phone in my
          hand, still on the page that reflected Zahra's name and contact
          number. My thumb hovered on the call button like it had been doing
          since the night she refused my invitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have battled with the need to call her and the pull to ignore her.
          To slap on the mindset that she was just another woman—<i
            >yes, another woman, but also the first woman you fucked twice. </i
          ><b><i>Twice</i></b
          ><i
            >. The first woman whom you can't get enough of. The first woman you
            confessed to.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Very convenient, this situation I find myself in. Quite fucking
          impressive.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed and pressed the side button. The screen went black.</p>
        <p>
          Grabbing the black face cap on the passenger's side, I slipped it on
          my head before getting my gun, clicking it into safety, and getting
          out of the car. While looking around, I shoved the gun at the back of
          the black jean pants I wore, and allowed the jacket fall atop it as I
          shut the van door, going around it till I was face to face with the
          house, but a lawn's distance away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard a shirl giggling sound coming from the house next door. A
          second later, the door pulled open, revealing a dark-haired boy of
          about seven running outside, holding a baseball with the broadest grin
          on his face, one that wasn't wiped off even when he stepped on his own
          feet and fell chest flat on the ground, the baseball falling out of
          his hands, and rolling down their lawn, to my direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Davide!" A voice inside the house yelled furiously, "Davide, get in
          the house now!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The baseball stopped right at the tip of my boot. I looked down at the
          object and watched it for a few seconds like it would jump and hit me
          in the face before bending and picking it.
        </p>
        <p>The boy was already walking towards me, wary in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Davide! Guiro su Dio, I'll whoop your little butt if you don't get
          back in the house at this second." The voice yelled again. <i></i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The boy hurried over and outstretched his hand to me. "Give me my
          ball." He said with a tough frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised a brow, looked at the object, and then back at him. "Are you
          demanding?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>"It's mine." He said, brows twitching.</p>
        <p>"Ask for it."</p>
        <p>
          A hint of fear flashed in his wide brown eyes as they moved to the van
          and then to me. "Will you give me my ball?" his voice was smaller.
        </p>
        <p>"Ask politely."</p>
        <p>He swallowed.</p>
        <p>
          "Please, Mister, will you give me my ball?" His voice shook, but he
          didn't move to run or leave the ball with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Davide?" The voice called this time with a hint of alarm. Without
          moving my head, my gaze caught a curly head woman standing still in
          front of the door, eyes wide as she watched the scene before her; the
          moment I outstretched my hand to the boy, giving him his ball, the
          woman started walk-running towards us.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you say, Davide?" I asked.</p>
        <p>The boy hugged the ball to his chest. "Thank you,"</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "No matter where you go or who you see. If you want
          something from someone. First, be polite, and if they don't respect
          your politeness, then you be tough. Hm?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes sir,"</p>
        <p>
          "Davide!" the woman reached us, pulling the boy to her side while she
          watched me with fear and anger. "Stay away from my son, or I will call
          the police."
        </p>
        <p>
          With the way she looked at me, there was no recognition in her eyes. I
          was confused about why she would assume I wanted to cause harm to her
          son.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of a door opening had my gaze going to Gemma, who was coming
          out of her house in a yellow tank top and dark grey sweatpants. I
          watched her close the door as she approached with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mrs. Astrella?" Gemma called, eying me quickly and apologetically
          before looking at the scared woman. "What happened?"
        </p>
        <p>"You know this man?" She asked with wide eyes.</p>
        <p>Gemma frowned, her expression as confused as I was. "Yes? What—"</p>
        <p>
          She pulled Gemma's wrist, taking her away from my side as she
          whispered in Italian, "You need to be careful of the kind of people
          you bring to the neighborhood, Gemma."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What did he do?" Gemma asked in the dialect, confusion in her voice.
        </p>
        <p>"He talked to Davide."</p>
        <p>"So..."</p>
        <p>
          "Look at him," The woman's judgy gaze quickly shifted to me and then
          back to Gemma. "He looks like a criminal."
        </p>
        <p>I am one. But apparently, my attempts to look casual had failed.</p>
        <p>
          "He's not." Gemma defended. "You shouldn't make assumptions of people,
          Mrs. Astrella."
        </p>
        <p>"He could have hurt, Davide!"</p>
        <p>"But he's fine, no?"</p>
        <p>
          "That's not the point—please don't bring someone like that into a
          neighborhood filled with children. It's not safe. Remember what
          happened to Flavio."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma shook her head, taking a step closer to the woman. "You cannot
          tell me who to and not to invite to my own house, Mrs. Astrella; I
          have been very patient with you. What is your problem with every
          single person I invite to my house."
        </p>
        <p>
          "They are not a good influence. In fact, you are not a good influence.
          Before you came here, people like that never came to this
          neighborhood, and now, look."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's literally a coke dealer living three houses away." Gemma
          pointed out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman frowned. "Just keep your hooligans away from my son, or I'll
          file a complaint."
        </p>
        <p>Gemma gasped. "Excuse me?"</p>
        <p>
          The woman regarded her with disdain. "Come on, Davide, let's go
          inside." With a fearful frown my way, the woman turned away from us
          and started pushing the boy toward their own house.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He didn't do anything." The boy whispered to his mother, and she shot
          back at him with a, <i>'Shut up and follow me.' </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          When they disappeared into their house and slammed the door shut,
          Gemma's shoulders slumped as she turned to me, and a small embarrassed
          smile touched her mouth. "I am so sorry about that; she's..." she
          sighed. "she's delusional."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, she isn't. I made a mistake with what I decided to wear. I wanted
          to look casual and less like a serial killer like you always call me.
          But the recent event has shown that I did not achieve that."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma's brows went up as she looked at me from head to toe. "<i
            >This</i
          >
          was your attempt at casual?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          She busted out laughing, shaking her head, "Oh God, my love, You're
          wearing a face cap and a black...e...well, a black everything, and you
          drove here in a small minivan? With black tinted windows? That's not a
          casual look; that's an 'I want my victims to know they would never
          survive it if I successfully catch them.' Look."
        </p>
        <p>"I see," I stated. "I must have misinterpreted casual then."</p>
        <p>
          She laughed softly, sucked in a breath, and shook off whatever
          feelings the woman from earlier had instilled in her during that small
          conversation. She allowed a genuine smile to cross her face as she
          approached me, enveloping me in a warm hug that had me standing very
          fucking still.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled away with a grin. "It's good to see you again, cutie. Gran
          Louisa has been dying to meet you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, not used to that kind of affection. "Has she?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yup!" she jumped on her feet, interlocking her arm with mine as she
          pulled me towards the house, "Hope you haven't had lunch! And I hope
          you like Italian?"
        </p>
        <p>"I am Italian, Gemma."</p>
        <p>"Even better because Gran Louisa made something extra spicy!"</p>
        <p>
          We got into the house, which was as normal as the outside. Very
          colorful. Beige, white flowery wallpaper, yellow couches, picture
          frames on all of the walls, the smell of homemade meal lingering in
          the air, a ginger cat, Sailor, whose pictures littered my phone
          gallery thanks to Gemma being obsessed with it, and want me to be too,
          for some obscure reason, was lying peacefully on one of the yellow
          bean bags in the living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Welcome to my home!" she untangled her hand from mine, twirling
          around with a grin. "What do you think?" Her eyes twinkled with
          eagerness for my response.
        </p>
        <p>"I think it is well put together," I said. "Colorful and homely."</p>
        <p>
          I didn't think it was possible, but her grin widened, and her blue
          eyes shone with pride. "Thank you," she thanked. "I put literally
          everything into this house, my savings from all the jobs I did, and
          this facial modeling gig I had a couple of years back. I saw the
          neighborhood in some real estate flyer back at the hood we used to
          stay in, and I said to myself, Gemma, you're going to work your ass
          off and buy yourself a house in this neighborhood. And here we are, my
          very first property."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That is truly impressive. I am sure Gran Louisa would have been
          proud."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, she was," Gemma chuckled fondly, "wouldn't stop talking about it.
          Every Sunday, I swear she tells everyone her granddaughter bought a
          house in some fancy neighborhood. They think she has dementia."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Being happy about something enough to repeat it is a far cry from
          dementia."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened. "Right? They just don't get it! The jealous ones
          always think she likes to brag about it, but she believes she will die
          soon; she has been saying that for two years now, and she's still very
          much alive and healthy, kind of. But she's the sweetest thing."
        </p>
        <p>"You seem to love her very much."</p>
        <p>
          "She's my only family, and family, I believe, is...everything. I'm
          sorry you don't have any, but that doesn't mean Gran Louisa can't
          adopt another grandson." She grinned, taking my hand and pulling me
          further inside the house. "Let's go see her in the kitchen."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes took in the small passageway that held two doors I was sure
          were the rooms, but my vision was taken away as she pulled me to a
          short corner, and we were in the most colorful kitchen I had ever
          seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow countertops, different colors of plates and kitchen utensils, a
          huge plastic fruit bowl atop the counter, and a real one on the dining
          table just by the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spanish music was playing from a speaker I couldn't make out in the
          kitchen, and beautiful, colorful flower pots lined the windows,
          looking like someone went to extra lengths to care for them every day.
          It all just felt so normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then my eyes settled on her grandmother, hair in a netted bun, wearing
          a pink sweater and jean pants; even though she was a little bit
          hunched over, she still looked smart as she cooked, moving her big but
          fragile body to the beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked like one of those people who would hug you to sleep like my
          mother used to do. The instant craving for that affection made me feel
          cold and empty.
        </p>
        <p>"Nonna," Gemma called her attention. "Elio's here."</p>
        <p>
          The woman turned immediately, soft blue eyes settling on me before a
          wide smile overtook her face, and she was wiping her hand on the apron
          around her waist.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, at last!" she laughed, walking over to me and, without warning,
          threw her arms around me like we had known each other a long time.
          "Good meeting you, Elio." She patted my back. Her hug was warm.
          Friendly, motherly. It made me yearn to stay there and forget that I
          had a responsibility somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she pulled away, she smiled warmly at me, short hand raising to
          squeeze my cheek. "Ah, look at you. Pretty man. Eyes like steel,
          created to woo women." She laughed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nonna, knock it off," Gemma said, going to steer what her grandma had
          been cooking.
        </p>
        <p>"What? I never see fine men like this when I was young."</p>
        <p>"Even Nonno?" Gemma threw from over her shoulder.</p>
        <p>
          The woman rolled her eyes. "Maurice had beauty on the inside." She
          said and then turned to me with a blank look, shaking her head like
          she didn't believe a word she just said, and she only said it to
          appease Gemma. "But you see beauty like you, Elio," she smiled at me.
          "Hard to see."
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you," I thanked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, yes, remove face cap; you are inside now; face cap is for
          outside. Why you wear one? Are you paparazzi friend?" she asked.
        </p>
        <p>"No...it was for me to look casual," I removed it.</p>
        <p>
          "Remove jacket too. Gemma is bad house guest. Never ever remove the
          jacket, and she ask why Luigi hate her, foolish girl."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma laughed, shaking her head. "Luigi doesn't hate me, Nonna; he's
          just bitter."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gran Louisa rolled her eyes as I removed my jacket and let my shirt
          cover the gun instead. She collected it from me, leaving me in just my
          black turtle neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I hang this for you," she smiled. "And yes, feel at home; my Gemma
          bought this place, so no landlord coming to bang and say, pay rent.
          Fucking Paolo." She said before walking out of the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze settled on Gemma to see her leaning on the oven, teeth holding
          off her grin. "She's a handful, isn't she?"
        </p>
        <p>"She's wonderful," I answered.</p>
        <p>
          Gemma nodded. "She also loves having people over; it makes her feel
          like she's made a new friend. The first day we met, I told her about
          it, and she was excited that I helped a stranger, and then when I told
          her we were texting, she was glad I made a friend."
        </p>
        <p>"You don't have friends?"</p>
        <p>
          Her smile dimmed. "I used to, back in our old neighborhood," she said,
          turning off the fire. "It wasn't as peaceful and spacious as this, and
          nobody minded their own business. When I saved enough to move, they
          just stopped talking to me. They had this notion that anyone who moved
          away stops being part of the community, and well, since I dared to
          move into the middle-class area, I'm now one of the people they think
          oppresses them." She sighed with a sad smile.
        </p>
        <p>"You haven't talked to anyone of them since you moved?"</p>
        <p>
          "Asides from fucking Luigi and Uncle Rod, no. Sometimes I ask myself
          why I dared to dream big, you know? Whenever I meet people like Mrs.
          Astrella who can smell the poverty in anyone, it makes me feel like I
          shouldn't have bothered."
        </p>
        <p>"Mrs. Astrella cannot smell poverty."</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled. "No, she smelled it on you and your weird minivan. Where
          the hell did you even get it? It looks very new. Oh my god, is it a
          rental? Did you rent a van to come to see me?"
        </p>
        <p>"No. I asked for it to be brought to me."</p>
        <p>She frowned. "How—"</p>
        <p>
          "Anything I can help out with?" I asked her, rolling up the sleeves of
          the shirt.
        </p>
        <p>"You can help out in a kitchen?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, Gemma. I had a mother and a very mean sister."</p>
        <p>She smiled at me. "Well, you can help set the table."</p>
        <p>
          I got to work, setting the table like she had asked when she called
          me. "Hey,"
        </p>
        <p>I turned to look at her.</p>
        <p>
          "I just want us to be clear about something first, from Gran Louisa
          comes in."
        </p>
        <p>"What is it?"</p>
        <p>"This thing between us, it's just friendship, right?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          She blew out a breath of relief. "Great, because I'm not really
          looking for a serious thing, and you seem like someone who wants a
          serious thing. I'm not even sure if I want another boyfriend after
          Giacomo, at least not so soon...I just, really need a friend."
        </p>
        <p>"I can say the same."</p>
        <p>"Okay, that's a relief. Thank you for coming today."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm glad I did," I told her with a nod before going back to set the
          table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gran Louisa reappeared. "Ah, handsome, and know how to set table; your
          girlfriend very lucky."
        </p>
        <p>I suppressed a smile.</p>
        <p>"Nonna," Gemma's voice warned.</p>
        <p>
          "Shut it. You have girlfriend, Elio? You are fine man; you should have
          lover."
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed a smile slip onto my lips as I arranged the utensils beside
          the plates.
        </p>
        <p>"Tell us." Gran Louisa urged excitement in her voice.</p>
        <p>
          I caught Gemma's curious stare on me, and I could tell she had grown
          very interested in the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat. "It's—I, yes, I have someone, but not a
          girlfriend, just—"
        </p>
        <p>"A fuck friend," Gran Louisa said.</p>
        <p>
          "No," I blurted immediately, and Gemma choked out a laugh. "She's not
          a fuck friend, Gran Louisa; she's a friend that I--"
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck?" Gran Louisa completed again.</p>
        <p>"It is complicated," I settled with that.</p>
        <p>"Ahhhhh," she and Gemma drawled at the same time.</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, setting the final plate and utensils while Gemma
          placed the covered bowl of food in the middle of the table, and from
          the look of it, they had made fried spaghetti; I could smell the hot
          sauce even from the covered bowl.
        </p>
        <p>She placed a jug of water by the side.</p>
        <p>
          "Let us settle, say prayer, and ignore table manner as we talk about
          Elio fuck friend but complicated."
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />Gemma chuckled as we three sat around the small table like a
          small Italian family, saying our prayers before we ate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nostalgia hitting me from left to right when we finished praying
          had me soaking in this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I hope you have a warrior's tongue," Gemma said excitedly and
          worriedly.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know yet," I responded.</p>
        <p>
          "No worries, it is only spaghetti." Gran Louisa said as Gemma began
          dishing the food.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, Nonna, spaghetti all'assassina. With extra Nonna spicy
          ingredients. Nothing much."
        </p>
        <p>"What. You suppose to eat every food like it is your last."</p>
        <p>
          "And that is why I never let you cook," Gemma said, settling when she
          was done dishing.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, children." Gran Louisa grinned. "Dig into hell."</p>
        <p>
          We did dig in, and after three forks full from me, I couldn't feel my
          tongue. Gemma's face had gone red, and Gran Louisa's lips trembled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay...I think...I think we stop now." Gran Louisa said. "Too...hot."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma dropped her fork with a loud clank, getting off the chair and to
          the kitchen sink before a gurgling sound filled the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I refilled my glass of water for the third time and gulped it all
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          It still didn't help because I was sweating like the spice was all
          over my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will...order pizza and increase air conditioner." Gran Louisa said,
          getting up from the table to the living.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew out a breath, checking my phone to see that I'd spent up to two
          hours here, and I didn't even want to leave yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing up, I decided to clear the table, even though my head felt
          woozy and my stomach was hot.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll help out," Gemma said, and I almost laughed at how red her eyes
          were. "My grandmother is crazy."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I agree," I admitted as we cleared the table together, and as time
          went by, the spice started to fade into a dull tingle, thanks to the
          change of temperature in the house and the fact that we stopped very
          early on, into the meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she washed the dishes and I rinsed them to dry, she asked. "So,
          this girl..." she said, "How come you never mentioned her?"
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't know how I felt."</p>
        <p>"And now you do?"</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>"And this girl—"</p>
        <p>"Zahra," I told her.</p>
        <p>"Zahra, do you know where she stands with it?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes." I placed a plate in the holder, picking another one to dry. "It
          is one-sided."
        </p>
        <p>
          She stopped washing for a second before continuing. "And you know
          this, how?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "When you tell someone you like them. They are supposed to respond if
          they like you too; she didn't."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma nodded, sighing with her voice. "Maybe she just wasn't ready?
          You know it takes some people a lot of time to catch up to their
          feelings? Maybe it's like that with her."
        </p>
        <p>I glanced over at her. "Are you saying that with clarity?"</p>
        <p>
          She shrugged. "Not really, I'm just saying it based on what I think. I
          don't know her, so I might not know what could really be going on in
          her head, but I think if you really like her, don't stop doing what
          you do. Sometimes, some people want you to give them a reason to show
          that they like you too."
        </p>
        <p>"Makes sense."</p>
        <p>"I know," she smiled. "And it's cute." She added after a pause.</p>
        <p>"What is?"</p>
        <p>
          "The fact that you like her. Tips of ears are redder than my face
          right now."
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised a brow at her, keeping a plate. "If I don't see it, then it
          never happened."
        </p>
        <p>
          She laughed, proceeding to inform me of the different shades of skin
          flushing and what they meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          About fifty minutes later, we were settled in the living room, the
          pizza had arrived, and Grandma Louisa had popped open an alcohol
          bottle.
        </p>
        <p>"Sorry about food, Elio." She said.</p>
        <p>
          "It's okay, it was spicy, but I enjoyed it," I told her, now recovered
          from the attack of the meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My dead husband like spice. He always say it is real men food. That
          is why he die early."
        </p>
        <p>"Nonna," Gemma chided.</p>
        <p>"What. I cannot speak truth?"</p>
        <p>
          "It is always advisable to speak the truth," I supported, and Gemma
          pinned me with a look as she changed the channels on the TV.
        </p>
        <p>"So, Elio, how come no family? Cousins. Uncle. Aunty, no one?"</p>
        <p>
          I drank from the bottle in my grip, about to give the usual response I
          deliver to anyone who asks me that question. "Actually," I started
          instead. "I have a brother, half-brother."
        </p>
        <p>"You do?" That caught Gemma's interest.</p>
        <p>"Hm," I said.</p>
        <p>"Why didn't you say?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"We aren't close. He doesn't see me as family."</p>
        <p>"Ah...bad relationship." Gran Louisa pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "I abandoned him. Although he is closer to where I am now,
          but—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're not his favorite person." Gemma completed as if she understood
          what I was saying.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "So, what are you doing to fix problem?" Gran Louisa asked. "What is
          plan to make you his favorite person?"
        </p>
        <p>I blinked. "Plan..."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, foolish boy, you think relationship will fix by itself. You have
          to draw him back to you. Life is not two, is one. you have to make
          peace with family because you don't know when death come and take them
          from you." Gran Louisa said. "Or you from them. You see, the same
          thing I always tell Maurice before he die. Make peace with family. He
          never listen, now they cut us off because of Maurice. All of them in
          France, living rich, happy life. While we are here, making do with
          what we can." Gran Louisa said, a hint of sadness in her voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze went to Gemma, and she offered me a sad but encouraging smile
          before turning her attention back to the TV screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, make peace with brother. Do not allow pride make you regret it.
          okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I responded with a nod, placing it in my mind that I would try
          to talk to him when I—
        </p>
        <p>"Oh my God," Gemma's worried voice got our attention.</p>
        <p>
          She increased the volume of the news station. A news anchor was
          standing in front of a high school, reporters all around, a little bit
          of chaos outside the school.
        </p>
        <p>
          "...Information reaching us is that there are three military
          mercenaries inside the school bus, trying to diffuse the bomb;
          surveillance footage from the school was sent to local authorities,
          showing how these mercenaries were handcuffed by some unknown gunmen
          and escorted into the school bus holding a total of 23 debate students
          who had just arrived from a successful educational campaign. This is
          Elena Colombo from Direct regional news." The screen cut off to
          parents around the school building.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Holy Mary, Mother, what this world has come to." Gran Louisa said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma changed the channel to another news station. They were airing
          the same news, but this shows footage of the school bus driving down a
          main road, cars running opposite directions via a mass announcement to
          give the bus space.
        </p>
        <p>
          A male news anchor from a helicopter filled the screen. "The school
          bus can now be seen driving on the main road of Montenapoleone. The
          mercenaries are said to be communicating with outside help, trying to
          diffuse the bomb and make sure it doesn't go off. The authorities are
          organizing help a few kilometers from the bus, clearing the roads, and
          creating a safe way passage—"
        </p>
        <p>Channel change.</p>
        <p>
          "...Parents are camping outside the high school waiting for updates on
          their children—"
        </p>
        <p>Channel change.</p>
        <p>
          "Italy, Milan has never seen a crisis this massive, and prayers have
          been set in place all around the city and the world, seeking a safe
          return of the children and heroes trying to stop the bomb and bring
          the children home, now showing you direct footage of the school bus.
          Evelyn Arrow, BBC World News."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gran Louisa stood up. "I will go pray for their safety, poor
          children." She said before disappearing down the passageway.
        </p>
        <p>Channel change.</p>
        <p>
          "...There has been no news on why the military mercenaries were
          kidnapped and sent into the school bus—"
        </p>
        <p>Channel change.</p>
        <p>
          "...Twenty-three debate championships kids in Italy, Milan have been
          put on another test after unknown gunmen set a lethal bomb inside
          their school bus—"
        </p>
        <p>Channel change.</p>
        <p>
          "...The governor of Milan has been asked for a sitting with the
          president regarding a possible terrorist attack after viral footage of
          Military mercenaries entering a school bus catches the media—"
        </p>
        <p>Channel change.</p>
        <p>
          "...Just in, authorities raid a small private sock-producing company
          just by the school after an employee suspiciously flees the
          environment; a couple of paintings of a Chihuahua was found in this
          raid," A photo of the painting was slapped on the screen alongside the
          employee who was trying to flee. "Locals are astonished after employee
          reveals that the company was put in place to ship these paintings all
          around the world."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, knowing the disaster this was about to cause.</p>
        <p>Channel change, this time with a frown on Gemma's face.</p>
        <p>
          "...ro Garza, a popular philanthropist and art collector in Mexico
          City, is the owner of the painting; a secret source says it is all
          part of an art quest that quickly turned criminal in the span of a few
          years," A picture of Arturo and the painting, was displayed on the
          screen. "but questions asked is; what does late Arturo Garza have to
          do with a school bus holding twenty-three children hostage, with a
          ticking bomb? This is Mallory Greenfield from CNN, USA."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hold on a second," Gemma said. "I think I've seen that painting
          before. I don't know, but...I have seen this same painting and heard
          that name...."
        </p>
        <p>My gaze snapped to her. "What do you mean."</p>
        <p>
          She quickly fished for her phone by her side, her hand tapping and
          scrolling as she got to her feet and made her way over to me, settling
          on the armchair as she brought her phone to my view, scrolling through
          pictures of dogs in an album that says 'dogs.' And then she finally
          stopped on the painting.
        </p>
        <p>"There it is." She said.</p>
        <p>I took the phone from her hand, zooming in on the painting.</p>
        <p>
          I couldn't find the tell. The little stroke that had been in every
          fake was missing, and I was genuinely impressed when the realization
          dawned on me that I was staring at the original painting of the
          chihuahua.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where did you take this?" I asked, understanding why my guts had
          pushed me towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mexico." She said, getting to her feet again as she paced the living
          room.
        </p>
        <p>"Where in Mexico?"</p>
        <p>
          "It was a year ago, Uncle Rod had sent for me, and Giacomo and I took
          a road trip to the manor in Mexico where Uncle Rod and Luigi worked in
          maintenance...shit." She stopped. "That's the name! Garza! Arturo
          Garza, the dead guy who owns the manor. Luigi was being a prick, and I
          was mad, but then,
        </p>
        <p>
          Giacomo told me that I should take a tour of the manor and take
          pictures for Instagram while he talked to Luigi, and I was just
          roaming around when I saw the painting, just sitting there, peeking
          out from behind a shelf in some abandoned store room, it was covered
          in dust. I cleaned it and took a picture because it was very peculiar,
          but I never got to post it."
        </p>
        <p>Arturo, you mad mastermind.</p>
        <p>The original painting never left the manor.</p>
        <p>"Where did you leave the painting afterward?"</p>
        <p>
          "I covered it and slipped it back behind the shelf. I don't think
          anyone goes in there."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          <br />"Do you think we should contact the authorities? Maybe it would
          help in some way?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. Don't get involved. Send this picture to me. I'll handle it."
        </p>
        <p>She frowned, "What would you do?"</p>
        <p>"Problem-solving."</p>
        <p>
          My phone vibrated in my pocket, and I brought it out, Angelo's name
          plastered on the screen. I handed Gemma her phone, getting to my feet.
          "Excuse me; I'll take this."
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, eying me suspiciously but choosing to trust me, as she
          returned to her seat and watched the news.
        </p>
        <p>
          I answered the call. "Significant emergencies, Angelo; when will you
          learn?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is significant. The governor has reached out; he needs your
          help. I don't know where the fuck you are, but everybody's looking for
          you." his voice was frantic.
        </p>
        <p>"That so?"</p>
        <p>"Marino, there's a school bus—"</p>
        <p>
          "I am aware of the school bus and the chaos and the quest going live—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you also aware that the so-called Military mercenaries are Devil,
          Dog, and Zahra?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped. My breathing halted for about a second or two. Slow panic
          ensues gradually.
        </p>
        <p>"Elia..." I whispered.</p>
        <p>
          "We are doing damage control over that, but political bodies are
          seeking your help smoothing things out with the president. We don't
          have fucking time on our hands, okay? Zahra, Devil, and Dog's lives
          are on the line, and the bomb is not fucking stopping," he breathed.
          "I didn't want to say anything, but I know who Devil is to you, and I
          know you probably don't give a fuck about the kids, or Dog, or Zahra,
          but your brother might die today, Elio. That should be a significant
          emergency."
        </p>
        <p>
          A wave of blinding anger overtook my mind to the point that I couldn't
          get a breath out properly.
        </p>
        <p>"Who led the operation."</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          I grabbed my jacket and face cap from the hanger. "Who led the
          operation for STREET. Who led the fucking operation, Mancini!"
        </p>
        <p>I heard him sigh and hesitate. "It was Zahra."</p>
        <p>"That <i>fucking</i>—I'm on my way." </p>

          That would surprise people who have only seen the side of myself that
          I always showed. I avoided situations I couldn't control, and this
          situation—fuck, I didn't know that bastard was going to pull a stunt
          like this; I didn't think he was capable of pulling this off or
          devising a plan like this. I underestimated him, and that one mistake
          might cost us our lives today. I was sweating; my clothes felt tight,
          and the cuffs around my wrists dug into my skin, leaving a red bruise
          that became visible whenever I moved my hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart, that little beating life source, had stopped functioning at
          the normal pace the moment I caught sight of those children.
        </p>
        <p>To think I was the one preaching about staying calm.</p>
        <p>
          All the sounds around me were delivered in distant echoes; the sound
          of a helicopter above the bus, which heightened my anxiety when I
          first heard it, the little whimpers and cries from the children on the
          bus, the noise in my ear from the comm; Milk and Upper's static voice
          trying to communicate with me, and the people around them.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          The sounds...God, they were all mixed together in shadowing echoes,
          seeing as my breathing was the loudest thing I heard, the
          <i>only</i> thing I heard.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra"</p>
        <p>
          My chest was tight, it felt like I had a fever, and the ominous
          beeping of the bomb tickled my head in a way that irritated me to the
          bone.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          I needed to breathe, to relax, to stay calm, be in control, but with
          this fucking noise around me, the honks from passing cars, shouts,
          helicopter fans, static, the hum of the bus, Dog's cursing, children
          crying. I needed the world to shut up for one goddamn second so I
          could think.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>If I could just think...then maybe...</p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          My chest was heaving, my mind supplying the image of my body being
          blown to bits after the countdown reached complete zeroes...but not
          just my body, Dog's body, Devil's body, the children, and rushing cars
          within a second distance—
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra!"</p>
        <p>
          I could stop it. I could save us all if I just had enough space to
          breathe and thi—
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra!"</p>
        <p>
          "What!" I yelled back at Dog, nervously bouncing on his feet a few
          feet away, looking quite pale.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I've been calling you for fucking ages; what are they saying? The
          blue fucking wire or the red one? Your comm is the only one connected,
          remember?" he said between hurried breaths; his panic was adding to
          mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They don't have any visual on the bomb. My explanation is the only
          thing that they can work with. I was asked to cut off the red wire,
          they weren't sure, but we have to be sure—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The red wire?" Dog's eyes widened. "That's a fucking, no. Red is a
          no, okay? It's in every fucking movie ever, never press the red
          button, never pull the red lever, never walk through the red fucking
          door—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil groaned loudly, "I don't know if you've noticed, Dog, but this
          shit show isn't a movie." He said from the driver's seat, doing his
          best to navigate the vehicle, not so skillfully.
        </p>
        <p>"Just go talk to the kids, okay? I got this." I said.</p>
        <p>
          "You've been saying that shit since you bent to get a good look at
          that thing; we barely have fifteen fucking minutes left, Zahra—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm fucking working on it! Get off my damn ear and let me think, for
          fucks sake!"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Guys, I know adren...ne is high right now, but there are children
            on that b...if you could tone down the c...ing a little?" </i
          >Milk's said, her voice hiked with nerves, static cutting her off like
          it had been doing for a while now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The last thing these kids need to worry about is bad language, Milk.
          Any word from the bomb squad?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Marino's people are com...ting with them via our line, but it
            wou....ke time because there are no visuals," </i
          >Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Time is the one thing we don't have, Upper. It's running; it's
          running fast." I licked my bottom lip. "How's coverage?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"It's all over the news; reporters are eating up
            the....bl...dy...litary...story, and cars are being cleared
            off...od."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew it was a matter of time before the media covered the story;
          that was why Angelo's people covered the news and supplied concrete
          lies to them. It would have been messier if <i>we</i> were the unknown
          gunmen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that didn't erase the fact that we had another problem. Signal. We
          were losing the signal for the comm. It started when we first set off;
          Devil and Dog had lost all communication, including me, at first, but
          then they turned off theirs, and mine picked up after a few seconds;
          now, mine was turning off, and my nerves were crawling underneath my
          skin.
        </p>
        <p>"How about Chika's tracker? Still on?"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Yes, he hasn't caught wind y...He's still in the city. But
            pre...ng to flee."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Good. That's good."</p>
        <p><i>At least I had something under control.</i></p>
        <p>
          I wiped the sweat off my forehead with my shoulder, the pounding in my
          chest making breathing a little difficult.
        </p>
        <p>"Listen, Upper, Milk; we might lose communication—"</p>
        <p><i>"We...saying...zah...ca...us?"</i></p>
        <p>"Shit...Upper?"</p>
        <p><i>"...oody fuck...can't...it's..." </i></p>
        <p>The static was hurting my ears.</p>
        <p>"What's happening, Z?" Devil's voice was etched in worry.</p>
        <p>
          "We're losing connection," I said, but my voice was small. "Guys, can
          you hear me?"
        </p>
        <p>Cutting voices and loud static was all I heard.</p>
        <p>"Hello? Upper? Still there?"</p>
        <p>Static.</p>
        <p>"Guys..." I blew out a breath when nothing came.</p>
        <p>
          My eyes burned from the stress of the situation as I swallowed. "I
          think we lost them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just fucking great." Dog cursed, hitting his cuffed hand on a pole in
          the bus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed the comm from my ear. "I can do it if I just...study it a
          bit more...."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog scoffed out an annoyed laugh. "We don't have time for you to study
          the bomb, Zahra. We're fucked!"
        </p>
        <p>The cries from the children doubled in number.</p>
        <p>
          "Dog, come on, there are kids here! Stop fucking around and talk to
          them, don't make shit worse!" Devil yelled at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit is already worse! Shit is fucked; shit is all over the roof of
          this fucking bus, calling the angel of death to come for a fucking
          wine and bread feast with our skin and blood as fucking starters. I
          ain't about to be delusional right now, and the fucking kids shouldn't
          have to be too."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Z," Devil called to me. "Listen to me, if you know there's a way—a
          chance that we can come out of this alive, please just focus and get
          to work, okay? Ignore that fuck head."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, I'm the fuck head now, huh?"</p>
        <p>
          "Dog, you do your part, and let her do hers, don't be the fucking
          prick, all right? Look at how scared those kids are. Do something
          about it."
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck am I supposed to do?" Dog exclaimed.</p>
        <p>"Figure it out!"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't fucking yell at me! I'm already panicking, and my shit is not
          together right now; you feel me? your yelling and commanding and the
          fucking beeping sound from that thing are doing a shit ton of bad to
          my fucking nerves." Dog let out tightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked over at him to see that he was pacing up and down the small
          length of the bus.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dog," I called, and hysterical brown eyes looked down at me.
          "Just—breathe, please."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The fucking irony, in a few minutes, I wouldn't be breathing
          anymore!"
        </p>
        <p>"Dog, fucking breathe!"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay!" He snapped as he stopped pacing and took a deep breath before
          letting it out. After doing it several times, he sighed.
          "Fuck...okay...okay...I'm calm. Zahra, you're calm; Devil, you're
          calm; children, you're all calm; everybody is calm. We're not on the
          road; we're in some fucked up escape room, and to escape it, we have
          to be calm."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right," Devil said. "Engage the kids, and Zahra, please
          concentrate."
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know if what I did was a nod or a shake of my head, but I knew
          my hand had gone back to the beeping device, littered with wires,
          light red, dark red, blue, white, yellow, all wired into the main
          frame that displayed the red beeping light.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, trying to level my breathing and manage the noise
          around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing I saw was a gloved hand over mine. Warm back pressed
          against my own, and hot breath fanning my ear as he spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"The first thing you do is never to panic; if you panic, you're
            fucked—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I snapped my eyes open and shook my head.</p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I breathed out. "I was trained for this a couple of years
          back. All wires here have a purpose,"
        </p>
        <p>"As they should," Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "There's one for stopping the time, another for making it fast,
          another for turning off the device and stopping the bomb, another for
          making it slow, another for setting it off—"
        </p>
        <p>"That's the one we don't want."</p>
        <p>"Dog." Devil's voice spelled warning.</p>
        <p>"Fine, Jesus, I'll talk to the children."</p>
        <p>
          I saw him walking to the front of the bus from the corner of my eye. I
          looked at the passenger seats, all eyes on Dog like they were waiting
          for him to try and talk them out of what he had already fucked up by
          saying they were all fucked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay, kids, I'm gonna be real with you. You've seen my worse side in
          the span of minutes, my panic? Yeah, I figure there's no need to stand
          here and shit talk you with rainbows and bumblebees of promises,"
        </p>
        <p>"That's starting off great," Devil muttered.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, some cries died down; but they still looked scared.</p>
        <p>
          Dog cleared his throat, looking around. "There comes a time in every
          man's life when he has to face death,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus fuck," I cursed, looking back at the device as Dog continued,
          his footsteps going down the school bus aisle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We might all die today, but we must perceive it as normal. Death
          comes eventually...." He sighed dramatically. "Who knows, you with the
          snotty red nose, you might be crossing the road to get ice cream from
          that weird old guy who never stops smiling at people, and, bam! You
          get hit by a car and die. The old man, he was still smiling!
        </p>
        <p>
          And you, with the stupid hat, your mom could be slicing vegetables one
          day, and wham! The knife flies out of her hand and straight to your
          left eye; she says it's a mistake, but plot twist, it's not; she
          fucking hates your stupid hat, and she missed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My mom's dead." a tiny scratchy little boy's voice said from the
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh shit, your dad then, either way, you somehow die by a kitchen
          knife."
        </p>
        <p>I heard a few chuckles from the children.</p>
        <p>
          "And you with the tiny creepy pigtails...wait, did your mom make
          that?"
        </p>
        <p>"My sister," a girl answered.</p>
        <p>
          "Ah shit, she hates you; never let her do your prom makeup or cut your
          hair, it'll end in a disaster, and you'll never get to date the cute
          boy in braces who everyone thinks is cool but still sucks his thumb
          when he sleeps."
        </p>
        <p>More chuckles.</p>
        <p>"What? You guys have someone like that in your school?"</p>
        <p>"Yes! His name is Alessio."</p>
        <p>
          "Ha! called it, it's always the Alessio's; Ladies, stay away from them
          Alessio's; they're not the cool people. Mommy issues, you don't
          fucking want that baggage."
        </p>
        <p>Laughter and snorts.</p>
        <p>
          "Right, pigtails, you get eaten by your dog, horror movie 101, never
          get the dog in the first cage with the watery eyes; they're always the
          dog cannibals, but you didn't listen because it was cute, and it
          smiled at you, even though you know dogs do not smile!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "My dog looks at me weird." a kid said. "I got it from the first cage.
          OMG."
        </p>
        <p>"See? Always skip the first cage."</p>
        <p>"What about me? How will I die?"</p>
        <p>"And me too!"</p>
        <p>"Will my dad kill me; I think my dad hates me."</p>
        <p>"I wanna know how I'll die too!"</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, tuning them out as Dog continued to...do whatever the
          fuck he was doing. It worked, and that's all that mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew out a shaky breath as I touched the dark red wire, moving it to
          the side a little so I could see where it was attached to on the main
          frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no indication. A bomb created not to be diffused unless
          stopped by the remote or by an expert.
        </p>
        <p>I knew I could do it. I just had to remember.</p>
        <p>
          But how do I remember it without remembering him? It was close to
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew out another breath and closed my eyes. The red ones are always
          to stop or make it fast...but sometimes it might be the yellow one,
          the white is uncertain, a...a...<i>detonator, </i>the voice penetrated
          my thoughts. I wanted to fight it off, but I grounded my teeth
          together and stopped resisting. <i>Or your saving grace. </i>The voice
          continued.<i>
            It all depends on how it was built or who built it. Your call
            matters, trust your gut,</i
          >
          gloved hands traced from my forearm to my arm,

            >you can do it amore mio, you can save them, focus and think, don't
            make me do it for you.</i

        </p>
        <p><i>"Let the children go, Martino; they're scared."</i></p>
        <p><i>"Only you can save them,"</i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Not like this; I can learn some other way; put an animal inside

          >His lips brushed my bare shoulder,
          <i
            >"You just have to do it the way I taught you, focus on the sound,

          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>I stopped to listen. "The middle," </i></p>
        <p><i>"What angle in the middle?" </i></p>
        <p><i>"Uh...I don't know. Left? Or—or maybe—maybe right?" </i></p>
        <p><i>"Focus."</i></p>
        <p><i>"I-I'm trying." </i></p>
        <p>
          <i>"Then try harder!" </i> The voice roared in my head, and I flinched
          with a gasp, my hand jumping with the dark red wire still in my grip,
          pulling it from the main frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beeping increased immediately, and the time started going down
          faster, the same way my panic went from a 5 to a fucking hundred.
        </p>
        <p>"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit."</p>
        <p>
          "What! What is it?" Dog asked, his footsteps rushing back until he was
          crouching beside me.
        </p>
        <p>"What happened?" Devil's voice urged from the front.</p>
        <p>
          "I pulled a time wire...I pulled a time wire by mistake; I didn't mean
          to; I was still studying it; I don't—how—fuck, fuck, fuck,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," Dogs hands were on my shoulder. "Hey, hey, you need to
          breathe and focus—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed him aside, getting to my feet and shaking my head like the
          thought of focusing was burning my lungs to crisps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog was up too, trying to catch whatever fucking mumbling I was
          doing...
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew many people were in attendance that day; anyone could have told
          Chika how that training ended, how I had failed.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, what is going on?"</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head frantically. "I can't—I can't do it. I don't know
          how...I'm sorry, I can't, I fucked up, I didn't think he would know to
          pull this shit—I can't—I can't—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, you can. You can do fucking anything; it's just a moment
          of mild failure; I'm sure if you—"
        </p>
        <p>"No, no, not this...I can't—I'm serious. I can't do this—"</p>
        <p>"Dog, come over, handle the wheel."</p>
        <p>
          I felt Dog leave my front towards the driver's side, my heart was
          hammering, and the little shuffling I heard was like background noise,
          and a second later, Devil was in front of me, "Hey, Z, look at me."
        </p>
        <p>
          My throat felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth, along sides
          my heart and everything in my chest; it was so tight. I was
          hyperventilating and, at the same time, trying to stop myself from
          hyperventilating.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra,"</p>
        <p>
          "No, I'm sorry—I just can't—I tried, I tried to focus, but I fucked it
          up."
        </p>
        <p>"No, no, you didn't. Not yet, because we are alive,"</p>
        <p>"I can't—"</p>
        <p>"Fuck Zahra, I need you to breathe; you're not breathing."</p>
        <p>
          "I should—I should have listened to you, we—we should have planned—I'm
          such a fucking idiot—under—underestimating people—fuck—I can't—I can't
          believe—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt him manage to hold my face in his hand, his cuff brushing my
          chin as he tried to make me look at him, worried eyes searching mine.
          "It's not your fault—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "No...no, it's my fault—I did this, I never fucking learn—I
          forgot that I—that I couldn't trust me—I can't trust me—I shouldn't
          trust myself—because it's not fucking reliable—I am—I am not fucking
          reliable—I shouldn't have—"
        </p>
        <p>He kissed me.</p>
        <p>
          His lips stopped my rambling and breathing as he pulled me tighter
          toward his body. Warm. Still alive. Like mine. I'm still alive. We're
          still alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          He pulled away from the kiss, locking gazes with me as my breathing
          leveled gradually.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you with me?" He asked quietly.</p>
        <p>"Y-yeah."</p>
        <p>
          "Good." He breathed. "Listen, I know how this looks; you want to blame
          yourself, and yeah, maybe you did make the wrong call, but you gotta
          remember that you're not the first person in the world who has ever
          made a wrong call. It happens to everybody. And when it happens, you
          don't dwell on that shit; you do everything you can to make sure you
          live to see another day and learn from it."
        </p>
        <p>I breathed shakily, swallowing down the nerves.</p>
        <p>
          "You're one of the bravest people I've ever met, Zahra. You pave roads
          when we are standing in front of a big fucking wall. You never break.
          At least you don't show it—"
        </p>
        <p>"But I did—"</p>
        <p>
          "Sometimes, when we break, it's okay to let people see, people you
          trust. Remember that day when you told me I could cry, and you'd never
          tell anyone?"
        </p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "Great, I'm making the same promise to you. You can break down all you
          want and have thousands of panic attacks; I'll hold you through
          them...I'll kiss you through them if I have to. Z, you don't have to
          fucking hide from me."
        </p>
        <p>I held on to his shirt and released another calm breath.</p>
        <p>
          "You can do this. I trust you with my fucking life. If anyone can get
          us out of this, it's you."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Yeah,"</p>
        <p>"Yeah?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, yeah..." I looked back at the timer; four minutes left. "We
          don't have much time."
        </p>
        <p>I quickly rushed to crouch in front of it, Devil beside me.</p>
        <p>
          My gaze went to the blue wire. I couldn't take the risk of pulling it
          now. It could have changed its usual function with how I had removed
          the other red wire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't touch the light red one. That was a no. It would most
          definitely be the trip wire.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only the white. It never changed function. But I didn't know
          what exactly its role was. It could either be... a
          <i>detonator or your saving grace. </i>
        </p>
        <p>Martino's voice reached my head again.</p>
        <p><i>"Do you want to take the risk, Zahra?"</i></p>
        <p>I blinked.</p>
        <p>"Where's your head at, Z."</p>
        <p>"Here." I blurted. "Here. I'm here."</p>
        <p>The timer went down to 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm thinking the white. It has two functions. One guarantees our
          safety, and the other...."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, but what does your gut say?" Devil asked calmly as if the timer
          wasn't getting close to death time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It says I should pull it, but what if...." I swallowed, looking at
          him. "What if I'm not right, what if, what if I pull it and—"
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, If your gut says it's right, then it's right."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "What the fuck is with you and Elio on this gut-feeling
          shit."
        </p>
        <p>His frown mirrored mine. "What?"</p>
        <p>"Is there some gut-feeling cult I don't know about?"</p>
        <p>"What are you..."</p>
        <p>1 minute 23 seconds.</p>
        <p>
          "Elio's always on this shit about gut feelings; he never shuts up
          about it."
        </p>
        <p>"Why the fuck are we talking about Elio right now?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because if he were here, he would say the exact same fucking shit to
          me after indirectly giving me the worst insult known to mankind;
          that's if I even get the insult with that fucked up vocabulary of
          his."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah...Z, the timer—"</p>
        <p>43 seconds.</p>
        <p>
          "Or—or better still, he would push me aside and pull the wire out
          himself because he would most likely want it to be a detonator, but in
          my case, it's different. I don't want it to be a detonator."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "You know what? Fuck it," I tried to hype myself. "W.W.E.D. What would
          Elio do, right?"
        </p>
        <p>Devil blinked. "Wrong because I don't get why we would ask—"</p>
        <p>I pulled out the white wire.</p>
        <p>The beeping stopped, the red timer turned off, and the bomb...</p>
        <p>"Holy shit," I said, staring at it.</p>
        <p>"Did it...Did it stop?" Devil asked</p>
        <p>"It stopped?" Dog exclaimed from the driver's seat.</p>
        <p>
          "We gotta wait for the one-minute dramatic silence, or we'll jinx it,"
          I whispered, and we all went quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          When one minute passed, and we were still conscious and alive, I
          breathed a breath of relief.
        </p>
        <p>"I think we can freak out now. In a good way."</p>
        <p>The children erupted in screams of happiness.</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck yes! That's what I'm talking about," Dog pressed the bus honk.
          "I never doubted you for one second, motherfucker."
        </p>
        <p>"Right, you didn't."</p>
        <p>
          Due to the cuff, I turned to Devil, threw my arms over his head, and
          hugged him. "Thank you. But tell anyone about what happened, and I
          will fucking skin you alive in your sleep, and I promise you wouldn't
          even be awake for it. Pass that across to Dog too."
        </p>
        <p>He hugged me tighter. "You got it."</p>
        <p>
          After about an hour and three of legal necessities that we took care
          of discreetly, asking our fake names and faces to be kept out of the
          news because of our supposed highly profiled military mission, we
          arrived back at the compound.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we entered the quarter, Milk jumped from a chair with a scream as
          she threw her arms around me in a tight hug, "Oh my God, I knew you
          guys were okay, but—fucking hell, I'm so happy to see that you're
          okay."
        </p>
        <p>I hugged her back just as tight. "Me too."</p>
        <p>
          She broke away, hugging Devil immediately. "I'm glad you were there
          with them; if it were just the two of them, that bus would have—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yup, I'm glad I was there too." He said, just as Upper came from the
          passageway, breathing out in relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You guys scared the bloody fuck out of me after that comm
          disconnected. I pulled out the Bible and prayed for the third time in
          my life." Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>"You have a Bible?" I asked as he hugged me.</p>
        <p>"Yes. You never know when you will need it."</p>
        <p>
          I watched Milk break away from her hug with Devil before facing Dog,
          "You just couldn't stop cursing, could you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the record, the kids love me now; I told them how they would—"
        </p>
        <p>
          She threw her arms around him in a tight hug, mindful of his wounded
          shoulder. "I'm so happy you're alive."
        </p>
        <p>
          He hugged her back with his good arm, letting out a dramatic sigh I
          knew was probably real. "It would have sucked for you if I died, so I
          just had to come back." 
        </p>
        <p>
          "You did good," Upper said, stepping away from me and then to Devil,
          who was checking his wrists which were more bruised than mine and
          Dog's. "You might want to get that checked out."
        </p>
        <p>Devil looked up at him. "Yeah, wanna help?"</p>
        <p>"Me?" Upper asked surprise in his eyes.</p>
        <p>"Yes, I was talking to you."</p>
        <p>Upper blinked. "Um...sure? I mean, I'm not great with the—"</p>
        <p>Devil sighed. "Stop being awkward."</p>
        <p>
          "I can't just turn off awkwardness; that is not how it works." Upper
          clarified.
        </p>
        <p>Milk pulled away from Dog, "I'll get the first aid box from—"</p>
        <p>
          The knock on the door stopped her from completing that statement, and
          whoever they were, didn't wait for a response before they came
          barreling in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four soldiers walked into our space, one holding a thick huge
          briefcase.
        </p>
        <p>"What's going on?"</p>
        <p>
          The soldier holding the briefcase dropped it on the center table while
          proceeding to open it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were five passports and clean bundle notes of money. "That is
          half of your payment for your team's deal with our boss. There's also
          a check in there for the remaining payment. New names and new identity
          cards with passports, if needed. From this moment on, you're all free
          to go."
        </p>
        <p>"What?" Milk asked</p>
        <p>
          One of the soldiers that accompanied him held my arm. "That is until
          the boss questions her."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whoa, whoa, whoa, let her go," Devil said, and the soldier...released
          his hold from my arm. "What is this about."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We were given direct orders to keep her in the compound prison for
          questioning when the boss returns, Mr. Marino."
        </p>
        <p>Devil's eyes widened. "What the fuck...did you just call me?"</p>
        <p>
          "With all due respect, Mr. Marino, we have direct orders from the Boss
          to not engage in further dialogue with you or any of the STREET
          members after passing the message across."
        </p>
        <p>My mind was tuned out of what the soldier was saying.</p>
        <p><i>Oh no.</i></p>
        <p>The soldier held my arm again, pulling me back towards the door.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait—wait, just hold on a second," I turned, with the soldier's grip
          still on me as I settled my gaze on a worried Upper. "Upper, what was
          your stat on Chika when you last checked?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper blinked. "Oh, that. Um. He arrived in Mexico." He said, and then
          wary crossed his brows. "But we got word about an hour later that he
          was found dead in some alley close to a busy street."
        </p>
        <p>My stomach jumped.</p>
        <p>"Dead." I echoed the word.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," Milk answered this time. "We don't know what could have
          happened; it's still a mystery."
        </p>
        <p>"We have to go." the soldier urged.</p>
        <p>"Yeah," I said absentmindedly.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey, Z," Devil called my attention, and I halfheartedly focused on
          him as my mind raged with questions I already knew the answers to.
          "When he gets back, I'll talk to him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog stood upright with a frown. "And when you get back, we'll talk
          about that shit," He said, gesturing to the money on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," I said quietly as the soldiers pulled me out of the house. I
          didn't even fight to tell them to let me go and that I could walk on
          my own.
        </p>
        <p>I just had one thought on my mind.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >If I didn't think of perfectly constructed answers before Elio
            showed up, I would be wholly and royally fucked.</i

        <p>A LOT OF QUESTIONS I NEED YOUR ANSWERS TO! GO!</p>
        <p>
          Zahra completely freaked out, because this meant more to her, but were
          you expecting a reaction like that from her?
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil kissed Zahra in the heat of the moment, what was going through
          your mind when you read that?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog also went completely ballistic in this chapter, do you think there
          was another way he could have handled things?
        </p>
        <p>Chika is dead, who do you think killed him, and why?</p>
        <p>
          The soldiers referred to Devil as, Mr. Marino. Do you think Elio
          revealed that when he arrived at the compound?
        </p>
        <p>Also, Elio is letting them all go? why do you think that is?</p>
        <p>
          And finally, Elio has asked for Zahra to be locked up for
          questioning....how do you think that will play out?
        </p>
        <p>
          Random question: I heard a rumor about NASA saying the internet will
          be turned off in the whole world for months. if that were to happen,
          what will you do to occupy time in those months?<br />

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>I UNDERESTIMATED </b>the torture in waiting.</p>
        <p>
          It had a crippling effect that slowly ate at your nerves, building up
          uncountable goosebumps on your skin, especially when waiting to
          receive a judgment for a crime you know you're guilty of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was aware that this was Elio's game, making people wait so that they
          would imagine how the scenario would play out, bite their nails while
          thinking of what could be happening outside, who could be spilling out
          truths, fucking up your chance of survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          As things had—dare I say—progressed between me and Elio, his making me
          wait was the last thing I was expecting. He had told me countless
          times that he didn't like beating around the bush. If he had shit to
          ask, why didn't he just show up and ask me instead of playing with my
          nerves like this?
        </p>
        <p>
          I flexed my fingers, trying to stop them from shaking. I would have
          gotten over the events from the bus if I had been given enough time to
          relax before this fucking ambush. But the worry of whatever this
          questioning thing would result in worsened the state of my mind. My
          hands were still so fucking cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been here for almost 3 hours if my calculations were correct. I
          had no idea how long he wanted to make me wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I was glad I wasn't kept in that fucking oven. The moment the
          guards had taken me past that particular room, I sighed in relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where I was now looked like a prison cell. A fucked up empty version
          that was created to scare people.
        </p>
        <p>
          No window. A small bed without covers, a small table by the side that
          didn't hold a chair, dim white lights, faded grey painting around the
          walls, and a quietness that could cut you to the bone. But it was
          better than that other place.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my mind scattered around the place, I didn't think I could take
          in that much heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood up from the bed again, pacing the room length while massaging
          my wrist.
        </p>
        <p>Chika was dead.</p>
        <p>I didn't kill him.</p>
        <p>
          Unless he had enemies I didn't know about, his death was most
          definitely Elio's doing. And if Elio had reached him first, then I was
          fucked.
        </p>
        <p>
          My suspicions were correct; the original painting was in Mexico City.
          And going back to the root of this whole fucked up quest would most
          likely get me to the original painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arturo Garza had died, and the manor was the only property he hadn't
          sold off or turned into an asset. Though it was registered under a
          privately bodied institution tasked with maintaining the building by
          employing people to keep it alive, clean it, and organize tours and
          excursions for little children. The manor would be the first place to
          look if the original painting could be anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          How I never thought of this before was way beyond me, and I was to
          blame for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hadn't been focused lately, going off tracks, leaving stupid slips
          ups like getting kidnapped by the Koreans, and getting myself involved
          with Elio.
        </p>
        <p>At the thought of Elio, I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
        <p>
          It was no secret that I found him fascinating, a well-sculptured
          challenge I wanted to win. A challenge that issued me complicated
          feelings every night. One that had me become as crazy as using him as
          an anchor to build up my strength to pull out a damn wire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raked my fingers through my hair, pacing around and counting the
          minutes in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caring for the victim of my effortless teasing wasn't part of the
          challenge. Liking how he talked and walked wasn't also part of the
          challenge; staring at him from afar when he wasn't fucking looking was
          not written in the content list for the so-called fucking challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe my worry didn't entirely stem from the fact that he knew more
          than STREET did at the moment, perhaps it came from the fact that I
          allowed us to get so far with this thing between us, and now I was
          worried that it was most likely over.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was angry at how my stomach turned at the thought of him reverting
          to that blank wall that was too fucking blunt for his own good...not
          that we ever crossed that level.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I would be delusional if I denied the recent little shift in the
          dynamic between us. How he had grown to become comfortable in my
          presence, the way he would look at me, without hate or irritation, but
          like a person he was interested in. A person he could tolerate. A
          person he liked—as he confessed the other day—a confession I had
          ignored because it meant something I didn't want.
        </p>
        <p>
          It gave a name to the feeling that had replaced the delusion of a
          challenge. I wasn't here to catch feelings for anyone, not for Devil,
          and most definitely not for Elio. Maybe at some point in time, I
          thought I could put up with a fling that had a title with Devil, but I
          never really dwelled on it because I didn't want it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the same with Elio—except—it never felt like an overwhelming
          need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never in a million years, strapped to that chair, fate uncertain, a
          bullet to my shoulder, and a plea on my lips, did I think with a
          single thought of Elio, I would feel his gaze on me, his fingers
          on—and—inside me, his lips, marking me and creating still purplish
          pleasure bruises on my body.
        </p>
        <p>But here we are; my brain had been fucked. Not literally.</p>
        <p>
          My thoughts had gone soft on a man I wasn't even attracted to the
          first time I saw him. A man who was in the category of men I judged at
          first fucking glance, a man who could walk in here, any minute with a
          gun and my life in his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I groaned, feeling that sharp jolt in my stomach with the last
          thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling afraid wasn't something that happened to me regularly. The
          first time I felt fear in a long time was when we met. I didn't think,
          for the life of me, that they would find that anklet. I wasn't
          prepared for the ambush, and with Elio's reputation, I was confident
          that he would ignore the warehouse burning down with the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then they found it. And the tiny locket by the hook, and I was
          forced to meet him before I had a chance to prepare, forced to plead
          for my life and that of STREET's because I couldn't read or predict
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio Marino was like a shiny new toy that I didn't like but was stuck
          with and had to eventually...<i>like</i> because, despite his
          similarities to the previous toys I had discarded, he was built a bit
          differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe that was why I understood him when he told me that I
          complemented his being. He complemented mine too, and it freaked me
          out in more ways than one.
        </p>
        <p>It was a new feeling.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't like to be shoved into the unknown. Being in the unknown
          meant being uncertain, and uncertain situations made me uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should be somewhat glad Elio would be angry enough to call things
          off between us, but I wasn't. I didn't like the idea of me never
          getting to tease him, or touch him, or listen to his sarcasm, learning
          from it, and having him look at me in a way that made me feel
          different.
        </p>
        <p>I despised these feelings, but I couldn't help feeling them.</p>
        <p>
          He had given us the payment and passports to leave. It only meant he
          had found the original painting or knew where it was; either that or
          he just wanted to get STREET out of his hair after this mess we
          caused.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be fucking damned if I let him push me out of the narrative now
          that things were already beginning to make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat on the small bed again for about thirty minutes before standing
          up and pacing for another thirty minutes...four and a half hours, five
          hours...six...seven...eight.
        </p>
        <p>
          In those hours, my nerves flew right through the roof, rocking on my
          feet, leaning on the wall, groaning, cursing, biting my lips till it
          was swollen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waiting...waiting and fucking waiting like an animal praying for a
          knife to reach its neck to end the torture of waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hated the silence. It made me think of unnecessary thoughts, ones
          mostly centered on him—the last time we were together, how he had let
          me see him, help him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Countless times, he trusted me with his feelings because he felt like
          there was no harm in doing that. He knew I wouldn't judge. But I knew
          he was primarily free with that part of him because he wanted me to be
          free too.
        </p>
        <p>But that wasn't as easy as it sounded.</p>
        <p>
          My trust issues ran deeper than I could even fucking reach. In the
          world I grew up in, it was safer to hold on to your trust, never hand
          it to anyone else because they would most definitely break it, and
          then use you to the point that you would lose yourself, believing
          anything they said, you would mistake manipulation for love, you would
          be gaslighted every second of every single day into thinking
          everything that goes wrong in your life, was your fault.
        </p>
        <p>I had been naïve. Too trusting. Too kind.</p>
        <p>
          Now I liked to think that I had a stronger sense of reasoning, even
          though I knew, deep down inside me, that the foolish girl still lived,
          hoping that she could find someone who wouldn't break and ruin her as
          the first person did.
        </p>
        <p>
          The little girl who surfaced today, the one that made my fingers
          tremor and my head foggy, the one melting in forced anxiety. After
          gaining my ground, I pressed that girl further into myself, hiding
          behind my newfound strength. It had cost me a lot. It would cost me a
          lot, but the world didn't become what it was today because people were
          kind and open.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always prided myself on being goal-oriented, sticking to a path that
          made things go exactly how I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I had derailed from my path. I was compromised in the worst way
          possible, and—
        </p>
        <p>
          The door pushed open, and I gasped at the sudden sound it made as Elio
          walked in, snapping me out of my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>When I took in his appearance, I frowned.</p>
        <p>
          He looked...unkempt, hair a tussle on his head; shirt sleeves rolled
          up to his elbows, the hem untucked from his pants. Head dropped low,
          studying the file he held, brows drawn down in concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door closed by itself as he came to stand opposite me, a
          reasonable distance away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I apologize for the delay." He spoke into the silence. "Today has
          been...harrowing, and I suppose I have you and your..." without
          looking at me, he dismissively waved his hand as if trying to find the
          right word, "cohorts to thank for it," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't seem...angry. But there was an air to him that made my
          stomach churn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around his body, realizing he didn't carry a gun, so he
          didn't plan to kill me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I won't keep you long, as I have political and criminal activities to
          see to after I am done here; I only have a few questions for you and—"
        </p>
        <p>"Would you at least look at me while you address me?"</p>
        <p>
          The silence after I spoke was more deafening than the one that had
          been in the room before he arrived. It was almost as if his breathing
          had stopped as he stood ramrod. His gaze not shifting from that
          particular spot on the file, his grip tightening on it a little,
          barely noticeable, but I caught it, just the same way I noticed the
          shift in his false calm behavior.
        </p>
        <p>"It's obvious you're angry, which you have every—"</p>
        <p>
          "Stop talking." He still sounded calm, but that edge had changed from
          nonchalant to <i>trying to seek control</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Keeping your anger in and trying to be mature about it will only make
          things worse for you—"
        </p>
        <p>"Stop talking, Zahra."</p>
        <p>"You can't shut me up; you've tried a couple of times."</p>
        <p>
          Slowly, he closed the file and dropped it on the table beside him, and
          then he raised his head, shoving both hands into his pockets before
          his gaze locked with mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't hide how I sucked a breath in, how my nerves seemed to fly
          in different directions underneath my skin, seeing shelter from the
          burning heat in those eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The controlled anger in them had me almost bowing at how in check he
          was with his emotions—even though I knew he could explode any second.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you want, hm?" He asked. "You want me to hit you?"</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "If that would make you feel better, I can take a punch."
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched me, brows drawing down a little, not in confusion, but in a
          frown that told me how frustrated he was with me, how he didn't want
          to be here but, for some reason, had to.
        </p>
        <p>
          He momentarily looked away from me to a spot on the wall before
          shaking his head. "I was sitting on my flight today, thinking about
          what to do to you," he said, looking back at me. "I asked myself, what
          punishment could I give to this woman? I scraped off anything physical
          because, frankly, that would be too boring and a waste of time and
          energy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a retort at the tip of my tongue but held back as he took a step
          closer and continued talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And, then I thought...how about something mental—Something that would
          have her spilling all the truths she guards so fiercely, but I figured
          that would hurt me mentally more than it hurt you, and I was at my
          last straw, so I scraped it. I thought about it for minutes before
          deciding there was no point to it. I asked myself why I should dwell
          on something that might not matter in a few days."
        </p>
        <p>
          He took another step towards me, and I had to raise my head a little
          to look at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Somethings, Zahra, just do not deserve my attention, but then I had
          the burning need to get answers to my questions, and that's the only
          reason why you're here."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another retort pushed at me, but I knew it wasn't time to joke around
          and mess with him; he was barely hanging on a thread with his anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might be tough, but I knew when poking the tiger needed to be
          suspended.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You already know I plan to let you and your friends go. I just needed
          to know why you did some of the things you did."
        </p>
        <p>"Ask."</p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched at my tone, eyes sweeping between mine, withheld
          anger shimmering in the grey of his iris, pupils dilating and
          constricting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anything, I just wanted him to lash out, yell at me, and let out
          the anger brewing inside him; maybe then I would feel less...guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For days, you kept someone like Chika in a house with my brother; you
          staged a kidnap, fooled your whole team, and kept it from Angelo, whom
          I put in charge of STREET affairs; why?"
        </p>
        <p>The scream I did internally had me wincing physically.</p>
        <p>Fucking Saucy bitch!</p>
        <p>
          I gritted my teeth hard, wondering what Elio had done to Chika to have
          him reveal that information.
        </p>
        <p>"I—"</p>
        <p>
          "When you answer me, Zahra. You do not answer with a lie, a dismissal,
          or a half-truth. I only want the truth."
        </p>
        <p>I gulped down. No lie...No dismissal, No half-truth.</p>
        <p>I was screwed unless I told the truth.</p>
        <p>
          He might not carry a gun, but I won't doubt the ability of his hands
          to snap a neck. My neck.
        </p>
        <p>Fuck.</p>
        <p>
          I cleared my dry throat, stepping back a bit before answering. His
          eyes followed my every moment like a fucking hawk, praying for me to
          slip up so he could attack. Not today. I would surrender to fight
          another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine," I started. "we were behind on finding the painting, and I was
          agitated. I knew I had to do something, so I contacted some of the
          people that worked for <i>Martino</i>," Saying that name out loud had
          me shifting uncomfortably, wishing I could bring Chika back from the
          dead and kill him again for putting me through all he did today. "I
          asked them for help because I knew they were also looking for the
          painting, and I know how easy it is to bribe out information from his
          people."
        </p>
        <p>When he didn't respond, I took that as my cue to continue.</p>
        <p>
          "They told me about Chika, and then I contacted him; he was on the run
          because some people had already caught wind of Arturo having an
          adopted son; I offered him protection if he would help us get the
          paintings and tell us everything he knew. I swear to you that he told
          me he wanted nothing to do with the paintings and Arturo's business;
          he said the same thing to STREET. I was too focused on the information
          he would give that I—
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't listen when STREET told me it was a bad idea. A day before we
          set out to the school, I overheard Chika on the phone, talking to
          someone about gold...300 million bars of gold. I waited until he was
          done, and with the look on his face, I knew he didn't want me to hear
          that conversation, but then he told me that a new quest email was sent
          to everyone invited. Which I'm sure you knew but didn't tell us."
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't my goal."</p>
        <p>"I figured,"</p>
        <p>"Continue."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Arturo had probably asked whomever the motherfucker sending
          out these letters and emails was to release the information about the
          new catch. It turns out it wasn't 50 million pieces of gold; it was
          300. I decided to keep the new information about the email from STREET
          because I knew it might mess with their focus, and I staged a kidnap
          because I couldn't answer questions on how I learned about Chika,
          seeing as I don't want them to know anything about Martino, or that
          part of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I didn't tell Angelo because he would tell his team, and I didn't
          trust anyone with that information; a lot was riding on it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He remained silent after I finished talking—just looking at me, his
          thoughts hidden from his face.
        </p>
        <p>"And the risk you took, getting into that bus—"</p>
        <p>
          "I didn't think he was going to pull that. If I had known, I would
          have asked Upper and Milk to contact Angelo's people immediately."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's not right. According to what I heard, you still had a few
          minutes of coverage with the rest of your team when you got on the
          bus."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. But I am not dumb enough to call your people when shit hits the
          fan. I knew the media would be involved in no time; if your people had
          come to rescue us, your name would have been caught in the crossfire—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a sharp step toward me, crowding my space and increasing the
          pace of my heart. "Do I look like someone who cares about some
          crossfire? You put my brother's life in danger; I could have lost him
          today."
        </p>
        <p>"But you didn't."</p>
        <p>"I almost did!" His voice raised.</p>
        <p>"He's alive."</p>
        <p>
          "What if the bomb had gone off, hm?" His jaw clenched, gaze burning
          into mine. "What if something had gone wrong, and the bomb set off."
        </p>
        <p>"It didn't; I stopped it."</p>
        <p>
          "But what if you hadn't? What if you failed? One simple fucking wrong
          decision, Zahra. That's all it takes."
        </p>
        <p>"I know that!"</p>
        <p>
          "Do you!" He yelled back in my face, and I flinched back. "Because
          when you act without thinking like you did today, it begs the question
          of whether that was your plan."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed with a glare, "Yeah because I'm some sociopath who loves to
          kill little children and herself while she's at it, nothing unusual,
          just the Sunday fucking special." I turned to step away from him, but
          his grip came around my arm and pulled me back to face him in one hard
          tug.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't fucking walk away from me."</p>
        <p>
          "Listen here, motherfucker; I have had the worst damn day in all of
          this year combined, battling with stupid trauma while I tried to stay
          alive, the last thing I want," I gestured between us. "Is this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, sorry, Zahra, I genuinely apologize that you put yourself in a
          situation that had you battling childhood trauma. Do you want a
          shoulder pat?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I was vibrating with anger when I gritted out a "Fuck off." and tried
          to tug myself free of his hold. "Let me fucking go, or I swear I'll be
          the one doing the fucking punching."
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand dropped from my arm. "You think you were the only one who had
          a <i>bad day</i>? Do you know the detestable things I had to do today?
          The people I had to kill? The damage control I had to take care of
          from your immature decisions while fucking worrying about that bus
          blowing to bits."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shot him a sweet smile filled with malice. "I was only doing the job
          you paid me for."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Agh," He groaned, raising both his hands as if he wanted to strangle
          me, fist clenching and unclenching as he turned away from me, loudly
          trying to control his breathing, which shook with anger as he kept his
          distance.
        </p>
        <p>After a few seconds, he turned back to me. "Admit your mistake."</p>
        <p>I breathed out a strained laugh. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Say that your actions weren't the right one to take. Say that you
          could have done about a thousand different things to change the
          outcome of today; apologize for fucking making me worry about you and
          my brother."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, watching him before grounding my teeth together in a clench
          and standing taller. "I did what I thought was right, and as always,
          we survived."
        </p>
        <p>"That's not what I asked."</p>
        <p>
          "If you're looking to break me, you might as well get back out there
          and get a gun to finish me off because I stand by my actions. It might
          have been a wrong call, but as long as I survived, I know damn well
          that I didn't make a mistake."
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't like my response. It did something to him, something that
          had the anger leaving his eyes, replaced with a question.
        </p>
        <p>"Why are you really here, Zahra?" He asked calmly.</p>
        <p>"You brought me here."</p>
        <p>
          "I know I did." He said, with a tired frown, one that resembled
          disappointment. "But I didn't care when my people found the location
          of your studio apartment. When they saw the little device in that
          anklet, and they thought your team was as dumb as they came, leaving
          something as delicate as that behind, I didn't care what motive you
          guys had. At some point, I thought Elia wanted me to find him, but
          then—I got to know you."
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze searched my face, "I got to see that this wasn't Elia's
          doing. It was yours. I was wary at first, but I shoved it aside
          because I had my goal set, and whatever you and whoever you work for
          were planning to do to me and the empire wouldn't matter because there
          would be nothing left to take."
        </p>
        <p>
          My frown hardened. "I don't work for anyone, and if you really want to
          know, I'm only here for the gold."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We both know that is a lie, and I honestly don't care to know why
          you're really here; or if you choose to remain boneheaded and deny
          your mistakes from today, I just need to understand why you were
          fucking with me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused, the glare on my face vanishing. "What are you talking
          about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He regarded me with confusion and frustration. "Zahra, If all you
          wanted out of this was the gold, my shelter, and the protection my
          name provided, why were you playing with me?"
        </p>
        <p>I was confused. "Playing with you...what are you—"</p>
        <p>
          "You lied to me, told me you and Elia didn't have anything to do with
          each other. You knew I wouldn't have crossed that line if I knew, and
          you fucking lied to me, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gears were turning in my head very fast, spinning, spiraling. "What?
          No, what are you talking about? I didn't lie...there is truly,
          <i>most definitely</i> nothing there—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The kids from the bus had something very different to say about
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes widened. "Oh, oh shit, that was—Elio, they're kids, they see
          two people kiss, and they imagine they are both in—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You knew," he ignored my explanation. "you knew how rocky my
          relationship with Devil was, yet you lied. You made me touch you, and
          like you; you fooled me, for what? Hm? Because I shot you when we
          first met or because I tried to drown you?"
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "You ruined every fucking chance I had of ever building any
          relationship with him, and that's fine. It's also why I want you all
          gone. Ever since STREET arrived, my life has been inconveniently
          eventful."
        </p>
        <p>
          This was going downhill so fast that I couldn't catch the damn rope.
          "That kiss wasn't—it didn't mean anything; I promise you, it was
          nothing like that—"
        </p>
        <p>"I already made my decision."</p>
        <p>
          "That wasn't the deal," I snapped. "we were supposed to be here to
          find the original painting, the gold, and your stupid fucking flash
          drives."
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a step back. "I can handle my business if you want the gold
          that badly; I'll have people send it to your preferred location when I
          find it. By morning I expect you and STREET to be out of my compound."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio," fuck. "Can we just double back and talk about this? You're
          angry, I am angry, and we both can't be hotheaded at the same time
          while we try to find common ground."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"It doesn't have to be like this."</p>
        <p>"It does."</p>
        <p>
          I watched him, and he watched me. For seconds, minutes, I don't know
          how long we stood there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could say many things to fix this, clear his doubt about Devil and
          me, but I didn't know how to say them. I didn't know if I wanted to
          say them.
        </p>
        <p>But I didn't like this. Not one bit.</p>
        <p>
          When he spoke next, it was in the dialect. "You can mess with me all
          you want, Zahra. I will take it, but involving Elia, the only family I
          have? That is something I won't take."
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't like that."</p>
        <p>"I can't choose between you and my brother."</p>
        <p>
          I took a step closer to him. "It really wasn't like that, Elio. I
          wouldn't purposefully ruin your relationship with your brother; what
          the fuck would I gain from separating family when I don't even have
          anyone of my own, nor will I ever?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't care how it was, neither do I care what your intentions are.
          This thing between us shouldn't have happened in the first place, and
          unlike you, I am willing to admit when I have made a mistake."
        </p>
        <p>"That mistake being me?"</p>
        <p>He hesitated seconds too long before he said, "Yes."</p>
        <p>
          I looked away from him, biting inside my lips, feeling like someone
          had dropped a weight of emotional baggage on my chest.
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Right."</p>
        <p>
          I couldn't deal with this right now. I wasn't mentally capable of
          handling this.
        </p>
        <p>"When am I allowed to leave here?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Anytime you want," he gestured to the file. "That's the contract.
          Whatever clause I didn't fulfill, you can take it up with Angelo; he
          will pay for it."
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "I wouldn't want to apply force when you and your team do not leave
          the compound by tomorrow, so make sure to do the needful." He said
          without looking at me before he turned and left the cell without a
          second glance my way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I returned to the bed and sat down when the door closed behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One would think I would jump at the opportunity to be out of this
          cell, and many would think I did precisely that the moment he left.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no. I sat there for two hours, knowing there were a thousand ways
          this day and this conversation could have gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with the result at the end of the day...I knew I had taken the
          wrong path.

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>"THERE YOU </b>are." Casmiro's voice entered easily into my focus.
          I falteringly tore my eyes from the page in the
          <i>politics today</i> magazine I was reading, raising my head to find
          him walking towards the gazebo. His steps were careful, hand laying
          against his torso, while he climbed up the two stairs before settling
          in the chair opposite me. "I went to your house to find you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked down at the magazine, not deeming his state severe enough to
          check for complications. "You should not be out. You need to heal
          properly."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm fine." The man offered with a grunt as he relaxed his back on the
          chair. I could feel his stare, but I didn't want to talk, nor did I
          want to entertain any human company. His presence irritated me, and
          indulging him was not advisable, seeing as I wouldn't want to say
          something he wouldn't like to hear. "It's awfully quiet lately." He
          spoke.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't respond as I read a line for the third time.</p>
        <p>
          He cleared his throat. "You never got back to me on how your
          interrogation with the man whom you caught from the herd that attacked
          me at Turin—"
        </p>
        <p>"He is dead."</p>
        <p>
          There were a few seconds of silence before he spoke again. "How did it
          go."
        </p>
        <p>
          A mind-video of me slashing a throat, scanning a file, traveling three
          states away from Milan, slashing more throats, painting walls red,
          muffling screams, and carving out flesh, filled my vision but vanished
          with a blink.
        </p>
        <p>"Unsuccessful."</p>
        <p>"And you killed him just like that?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "So...How do you suppose we find the people responsible for the
          shooting at my racing company."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Word has been sent to our associates in Sicily; they will handle it.
          You need not bother."
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard him sigh. "I have been...meaning to ask." He started, taking
          my silence as a cue to continue. "It has been a week since STREET
          left. I asked my people, and they say you haven't properly addressed
          our search for the painting. May I know if they left because of the
          media chaos after the bus incident?"
        </p>
        <p>"What other reason is there."</p>
        <p>
          "We sorted out the media along sides some of our associates in
          America, and the painting is no longer of interest to the masses." I
          saw him shift in his seat from my periphery. "I think we should bring
          STREET back in. I still communicate with one of them, Upper. And he
          says they are close to—"
        </p>
        <p>"Casmiro,"</p>
        <p>"Yes?"</p>
        <p>
          "Your presence is a bother to me," I said, raising my head to regard
          him. "Do you mind leaving." It was not a question.
        </p>
        <p>
          He blinked at me, a frown pulling down his brows. "Did something
          happen?"
        </p>
        <p>"Casmiro," I closed the book. "Leave."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "Does my command mean nothing now. Have we grown too familiar that you
          do not understand a simple statement." Those were also not questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          His frown remained, and he didn't make any move to leave. "Now I know
          why nobody dared to say a word when I asked about you. You're in a
          mood. But we don't have time for your mood. The stakes are higher; we
          need to get moving if we—"
        </p>
        <p>"We leave for Mexico tonight."</p>
        <p>
          "Why am I just hearing this?" He asked, his whole form tight with
          annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>"Because I am just deciding it. Now leave."</p>
        <p>"Tell me what happened. Who pissed you off?"</p>
        <p>I groaned, regretting not bringing a cigar or a drink with me.</p>
        <p>"You are not going to leave me alone, are you?"</p>
        <p>
          "No. You're acting worse than you usually do; everyone is waiting for
          you to snap and working extra hard, so you see no reason to snap and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I made a mistake." I cut him off, watching how his frown morphed
          slowly into surprise. I knew that statement might have sounded so
          foreign to him.
        </p>
        <p>"You..." he drawled, not comprehending, "made a mistake."</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Can you elaborate? Shed more light?"</p>
        <p>
          "How comfortable are you with discussing matters regarding my
          brother."
        </p>
        <p>
          His stern eyes searched mine before he asked, "Why would you assume
          I'm uncomfortable talking about your brother."
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the magazine on the table between us. "You have not exactly
          been forthcoming since you learned of his existence; I believe before
          your accident, we weren't on talking terms."
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head, sighing. "I was angry you didn't tell me."</p>
        <p>"I did not tell anyone."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not anyone." He snapped. "I thought we were trusting each other
          now; I mean, all those years ago? Did you think I would hurt him if I
          found out?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I didn't want you to know because I never planned on seeing him
          again."
        </p>
        <p>"Would you have told me if I didn't find out?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          He was clearly displeased with my response. "Alright. Let's get back
          on topic. Who pissed you off."
        </p>
        <p>Going silent, I contemplated.</p>
        <p>
          Telling him what bothered me 24/7 for the past week would make it seem
          real. It would coerce the self-admission that I have been thinking
          about it...about <i>her</i>, and I didn't want to because my gut told
          me I made the right decision, but my head, mind, and whole being
          wanted to seek her out.
        </p>
        <p>It was unhealthy.</p>
        <p>
          I was aching to, once again, be in her presence, know what she was
          doing at all times, and make myself the only thing that could keep her
          attention. I was longing for the only woman I couldn't have. My
          addiction wasn't fading. This wasn't withdrawal; this was a
          full-bodied denial of my feelings and what I truly wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was this budding anger inside of me, one that made me feel
          uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was missing something I never knew I once lacked. Zahra had left a
          gaping hole inside me, and I was to blame for it.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio?"</p>
        <p>Casmiro's careful tone of voice shoved me out of my thoughts.</p>
        <p>"I was involved with Zahra. Romantically."</p>
        <p>I expected the silence that followed.</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's stare was blank for about a minute before haltingly; his
          brows drew together, and his lips formed a frown, thinning with a move
          that told me he needed me to repeat that statement.
        </p>
        <p>"You were what?"</p>
        <p>
          "I knew beforehand that she was involved with my brother, but she told
          me she wasn't, and I believed her because I thought she was telling
          the—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hold on, hold on," Casmiro sat up, hand supporting his torso, "Just
          double back for me; you fucked...you fucked that cunt?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The flare of withheld anger that flashed by my whole form in seconds
          had me pinning him with a glower. "Call her that again, and I will
          shoot you and make sure you die this time," I warned. "It was not a
          threat. I will kill you if you repeat what you just said."
        </p>
        <p>
          He waved his hands dismissively, a tight frown on his face. "You
          fucked her?"
        </p>
        <p>"Don't put it like that."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes widened as he gestured wildly with his hand. "How the fuck do
          you want me to put it?" He exclaimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not," I stopped, clearing my throat. "It <i>was</i> not just the
          sex. There was something else."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro frowned, blinking as if trying to understand what I was saying
          but failing to. "Something else like...you had her sign an NDA or some
          sort of—"
        </p>
        <p>"No, nothing like that. I meant. It wasn't just physical."</p>
        <p>
          He backed up. "Wait...emotional? Feelings? You..." The confusion on
          his face morphed into concern, a grimace, and then disbelief. "You
          <i>like</i> Zahra?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "You speak of it like it is some sort of fatal illness to
          like her."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry, I just don't see it. In my head—trying to picture you
          and—what—no—you're joking."
        </p>
        <p>
          Annoyance brewed around my chest, making it grow tight. "Why would I
          joke about this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know? To fuck with me? Make me think I'm in some coma
          hell...are you my fucking subconscious? Am I dying?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do not be unnecessarily dramatic about this. You were the one who
          wanted to know why I was in a mood."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, "Right, yes. I wanted to know, but I didn't think you would
          tell me you've been fucking—Hold on, when did this start?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Months...a few months now. Although it was a little back and forth at
          first and then." I sighed. "I won't disrespect her by telling you any
          detail; all you need to know is that we were involved until recently."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought you didn't like her? You tried to drown her, for fucks
          sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was before I got to know her. I could not understand why she
          made me feel things. I could not predict her. I still can't, nor do I
          want to. I only seem to know her better now."
        </p>
        <p>"Just because you fucked her."</p>
        <p>
          "Before then." I corrected. "She has this...charisma, very much alike
          to mine, and I was interested, and one thing led to another, and
          we..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right," Casmiro shook his head. "I am too sober for this
          conversation, and—"
        </p>
        <p>"You are not drinking."</p>
        <p>"No, I think I am—"</p>
        <p>
          "The doctor clearly stated you cannot drink alcohol until full
          recovery," I told him. "Repudiate that thought this instant."
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "How am I supposed to digest all you're telling me with a
          clear mind? For god's sake, it's just impossible. I thought you were
          celibate."
        </p>
        <p>I raised a brow. "Was I?"</p>
        <p>
          "I haven't seen you with a woman in so long—like years, and—just—of
          all the women out there, you choose the one who could be defined as
          suspicion if it were ever a person."
        </p>
        <p>"I cannot help who I like."</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know, E...I've never trusted that woman. I don't like her at
          all. I don't know why? I just don't."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm. I can imagine why."</p>
        <p>
          "No, no, you don't get me. The day I was attacked, Zahra and I got
          into this verbal exchange in the car on the way to the airport. It was
          heated. She threatened me. She told me to stay out of her business.
          The look in her eyes, her whole demeanor? Everything changed in that
          one second; I glanced her way. If I could read minds, I would have
          definitely caught her plotting something."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shook his head, pinning me with a stare that begged me to see
          reason. "Think about it, E, she threatened me, and then I'm being shot
          at, hours later? Can't be a coincidence."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I see the sense in what you are saying. But I asked her, she denied,
          and I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt."
        </p>
        <p>
          He worked his jaw. "She's using you. I am one hundred percent sure she
          doesn't feel anything you're feeling for her."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know that. But all of this was not why I told you about our affair
          in the first place. It concerns my brother—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right, she just randomly has the only living Marinos wrapped around
          her fingers."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ignoring that observation, the mistake I made was getting involved
          with her without checking to see if my brother held feelings for her."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's lips thinned. "So you messed up your relationship with your
          brother by sleeping with his girlfriend."
        </p>
        <p>"She told me they weren't together."</p>
        <p>
          "She's a liar, E. A skillful one. I think she was even trained to
          lie."
        </p>
        <p>"I am aware."</p>
        <p>
          He sighed. "That's why you had them off the case? Because you
          both—ended your uh...affair?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I needed Elia out of the compound. I needed Zahra out too. She
          was complicating things, messing with my goal, and I wouldn't say I
          liked that she kissed my brother. I didn't want to entertain the way
          it made me feel. It distracted me. It made me... angry at him. I am
          never angry at him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow." Casmiro breathed out, scoffing and shaking his head in
          disbelief. "I've never heard you speak of a woman like this; it only
          means you're not saying this because the sex was good. You really do
          like her, don't you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is now in the past. None of it matters. Once we leave for Mexico
          and find the painting and those flash drives, I would like to discuss
          something with you, regarding Elia, and some other minor things."
        </p>
        <p>He frowned. "Why not discuss it now?"</p>
        <p>
          "I want to be certain of my situation before I do. It is nothing to
          worry about, just future planning for yourself."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay..." He eyed me. "Why would we discuss my future, though."</p>
        <p>"Why wouldn't we? Do you want to be second to me all your life?"</p>
        <p>"I have never complained; I was trained for this job."</p>
        <p>
          "I know. But I also know you have been capitalizing on your racing
          business and the automobile one you haven't had the chance to work on
          because of the family business. I can help you draft out a starting
          plan, expand it into—"
        </p>
        <p>"What's happening?" He cut me off.</p>
        <p>"We are talking."</p>
        <p>"I know we are talking, but why are we talking about this?"</p>
        <p>
          I shrug. "I have been doing...a lot of thinking lately. Every
          individual has something they are very passionate about. But you were
          born into the family, so automatically, you have had to put your
          passion second. Let us change that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am completely contented with my passion being second. This is so
          random."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We will discuss it later," I said, looking up to see Angelo
          approaching, dressed in a sharp dark blue blazer and slacks with a
          file in his hand, looking like he just left his home and was heading
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Afternoon, Marino." He greeted before looking over at Cas, who had
          gone stiff. "They cleared you for movement?"
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro blinked. "What?"</p>
        <p>"The doctors, did they clear you?"</p>
        <p>
          The man in question cleared his throat, caught off guard by Angelo's
          presence. I knew he always liked to be prepared. "Yes. This morning.
          I'm good."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo nodded before turning to me again, oblivious. "I got the
          information you requested." He said, taking the chair by my side as he
          handed me the file. "Did a lot of digging; it was buried in archives;
          somebody went a great deal to hide it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My father wasn't the best at keeping things. If it were me, you would
          never have found it." I said, opening it and reading through. My chest
          tightened with each word I read from the file, realizing how
          detestable my situation was.
        </p>
        <p>"What is it?" Casmiro asked, sensing the shift in my form.</p>
        <p>
          I could tell Angelo waited for my answer, too, as he had been dying to
          know why I asked him to dig out my military admission file. The one my
          father never showed me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's information from my time in the army," I said, closing the file.
          "About a month ago, I had some flashbacks to my time in camp. It was a
          memory of me and my commander. I was in some sort of trance.
          Hypnotism, I suspected. I have only now confirmed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why would they do that?" Angelo asked. "Hypnotism is usually for
          soldiers who suffer from mental breakdowns after a war; you were
          okay."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. It started before any real mission was put in place. My father
          asked for special training for me when he found out—" I glanced at
          Casmiro, realizing my slip-up.
        </p>
        <p>"Found out what?" he asked.</p>
        <p>Angelo looked at me, probably wondering if I would say anything.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "He found out I had inherited my mother's mental illness."
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "It is hard to remember what exactly the full diagnosis was. I think I
          was made to forget some of it. But it was mild clinical depression,"
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro frowned. "What the hell—"</p>
        <p>
          "Which is not the case anymore." I lied and caught Angelo looking away
          from me. "I am okay. I have just been concerned about this hypnotism
          issue. I have no idea what memory is real or fake or if some of my
          thoughts are my own. It is concerning."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro sat up straighter, worry in his eyes. "We can undo it, right?
          Seek professional help—"
        </p>
        <p>"Hm. No. I don't have time for all of that."</p>
        <p>
          "I think Casmiro's right. You should undo it, get help, get a hold of
          your mind, and own your thoughts."
        </p>
        <p>"I am fine. All I wanted was confirmation."</p>
        <p>
          Angelo's frown became very personal. "Why are you so hell-bent on
          never getting professional help with literally anything?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My response was right at the tip of my tongue. "I am underserving of
          it,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo made a strained noise, "I am tired of hearing you repeat that
          every time—"
        </p>
        <p>"I do not need help."</p>
        <p>
          "Honestly, I'm beginning to wonder if you were made to think you don't
          need help." he shook his head before getting to his feet. "It's almost
          time for one of my meetings—"
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes didn't leave his face, which was etched with a frown. "We will
          leave for Mexico tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Noted." he straightened his blazer. "I will join early tomorrow. Have
          a safe flight." He said, nodding curtly to Casmiro and me before
          walking away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He knew about it, didn't he?" Casmiro's voice had me looking back at
          him. "You told him."
        </p>
        <p>"He found out."</p>
        <p>"But he knew," He frowned, "And I didn't."</p>
        <p>"It was not important, Casmiro, do not make an issue of it."</p>
        <p>
          He sat up. "An issue? You're not seeking medical help for something
          that could be detrimental to your health. I didn't know about it; I am
          your shadow; I should know everything about you."
        </p>
        <p>"You do."</p>
        <p>"But I didn't know this."</p>
        <p>
          "Now you do," I answered. "Besides, it is not of importance. I am the
          same person you have always known."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are not." He clarified. "At first thought, when you came back
          from the army, I assumed your change was because of all you had to do
          there; people are never the same as they were whenever they return.
          But something else changed."
        </p>
        <p>"This conversation is irrelevant."</p>
        <p>
          "It's not because I don't think you realize it. You became so much
          like Ricardo. The beliefs you once swore against were your motto. You
          trusted no one; you had these new methods of torturing that first
          scared the shit out of me. You just weren't the same."
        </p>
        <p>
          "How does your new light bulb moment help our current predicament."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It doesn't because we are not talking about that; we are talking
          about you, how to undo whatever those people did to you."
        </p>
        <p>I tilted my head, watching him. "What if I don't want to?"</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>"What if I like what they did to me?"</p>
        <p>"What if you were made to think that you like it?"</p>
        <p>"What if I like that I was made to think I like it."</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro shook his head. "I hate that there is no winning with you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is nothing to be won, just like there is no issue here. Hm? I
          do not need help, neither do I have the zeal to get one, or the time,
          for that matter. I am almost at the finish line, finding that
          painting, getting the ultimate power over everyone with power." I
          straightened in my chair. "That should be your focus right now,
          Casmiro. That and trying your best not to be obvious about your liken
          towards my ex-consigliere."
        </p>
        <p>His lips lifted in a snare. "Keep your voice down."</p>
        <p>I looked around. "He's long gone."</p>
        <p>"There are soldiers around, for fucks sake."</p>
        <p>
          "We both know they won't talk." I leveled him with a taunting stare.
          "We both know you want me to keep my voice down so you wouldn't have
          to hear me voice it out."
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I had successfully taken his attention off his concern for my
          health when he glared at me and said, "You are wrong."
        </p>
        <p>"Ah...am I?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. It's not what you think. I just wasn't prepared for his
          arrival."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>
          Angelo's family had been with the Marinos for decades, although Angelo
          himself was never around often when we were young. He stayed with his
          mother in Turin but visited the compound occasionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro had been irrationally obsessed with him. But he never talked
          to him. He Just stalked from afar. When Angelo took over his father as
          the consigliere, Casmiro made sure to keep his distance, and Angelo,
          well, didn't suspect anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, they conversed when necessary. They weren't friends, neither were
          they enemies; they were like coworkers in the same department. Except
          one was obsessed with the other, who was oblivious and probably didn't
          care if the obsessed one existed or didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't care. I could politely ignore it as long as I wasn't fixed in
          the middle and affected by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your helpless pining is beginning to border into pathetic territory.
          How long has it been? Since you were 14?"
        </p>
        <p>"Says the guy who slept with his brother's girlfriend."</p>
        <p>"Is that supposed to make me...<i>back off?</i>"</p>
        <p>
          "You know what? You were right; we are not supposed to be on talking
          terms." He got to his feet with a grunt. "I will leave you now."
        </p>
        <p>"I will appreciate that."</p>
        <p>
          He tsked before making his way out of the gazebo without irritating
          his injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him until he was out of sight, carrying the amusement from
          our earlier conversation with him.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "Evening Mister," The receptionist at the motel greeted me when I
          reached her. "We have the room cleaned as usual; everything is in
          place."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, slipping her a bundle of dollar notes. "Thank you," I said.
          "Did you, by chance, happen to feed him this morning?"
        </p>
        <p>The woman frowned. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Never mind," I told her before walking away, knowing she
          had cleaned, meaning he was fed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I reached the room, I shrugged off my coat, seeing his quiet
          figure on the chair, staring out the window like he usually did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked over to him. "Do you ever use the bed?" I asked, settling on
          the window sill, watching his frail form, looking as sickly as ever.
        </p>
        <p>My father sighed. "The cars keep me company."</p>
        <p>
          "There's a TV in the room to keep you company." I reminded him, but he
          didn't seem to acknowledge that. His gaze was just solely outside the
          window. "I would have come by sooner. But there was a little chaos; I
          had to handle it." I said, "You won't ask what it was about?"
        </p>
        <p>"You will tell me anyway."</p>
        <p>
          "Not really. I don't think I want to visit it. But there is one thing
          I think you should know, though."
        </p>
        <p>He dragged his droopy eyes to look at me. "What."</p>
        <p>
          "I know where the painting is. And soon, I will have those flash
          drives. Soon you will be out of here and get that death you so badly
          wish for."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You still want to burn down my empire; you are still vengeful." His
          face tried to form a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed. "After all these years, one would think you would register
          the fact that burning it all down is how we will end. Did you think
          your wife burned down that church with her and your other children for
          a show? She was showing us how it would all end. Your thirst for
          power, money, and status. The fire can take it all away."
        </p>
        <p>"I am disappointed." He said.</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"This was not what I wished for you, Elio."</p>
        <p>
          I took a deep breath and let it out as I spoke. "You did this with
          your own hands."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No. You did this. Your head was never going to be
          fixed. You want to end up like your mother only because you are just
          like her. Crazy. Delusional. Pathe—"
        </p>
        <p>
          My backhand connected with his cheek in a hard slap that had his head
          turning to the side at the impact. The sting biting at the back of my
          hand as I stood upright, my anger simmering. "You won't be seeing me
          for a while. Hope that will teach you a lesson on how to control that
          godforsaken tongue of yours."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You won't succeed." He wheezed out. "You don't have the spine to do
          it. To burn it. You are too weak; you would have done it if you really
          wanted to do it. That is why I am not worried. It won't work. You will
          fail."
        </p>
        <p>I clenched my jaw so hard that I felt pain.</p>
        <p>
          Slowly, tentatively, I leaned down, looking him right in the eye and
          reveling in the hate and fear I spotted in them as I spoke.
        </p>
        <p>"Why don't we wait and see." </p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>IF PATHETIC </b>were a person, it would be me.</p>
        <p>
          At first, I didn't feel this way; I buckled the guilt and told STREET
          that we were free and could get the painting without anyone's help. I
          ignored the heaviness in my chest, which had been there since I left
          that cell. After all, I never dwelled on what was; I always looked
          forward to what would be.
        </p>
        <p>Except, this time was different.</p>
        <p>
          I knew I had been compromised, but I didn't think it had gotten to the
          extent where I would be tucked into myself, sinking into my guilt and
          regret.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was on my headphones, music playing, starting and ending, with me
          not listening to the lyrics, sound, or artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to my side on the bed, the floor-to-top window showcasing the
          vast dark blue of the sea. Through my headphones, I could hear the
          dull hum around me, which told me we were above water, and I was
          missing out on all the fun just because I couldn't escape my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slipping my hand underneath my pillow, I pulled out the gun that had
          taken its permanent fortress under my head, one I had contemplated
          leaving behind but couldn't.
        </p>
        <p>My thumb finger slowly traced his initial on the gun. <b>EM</b>.</p>
        <p>Fuck.</p>
        <p>I miss him.</p>
        <p>
          I had never missed anyone. I shouldn't miss <i>Him</i>. We didn't have
          anything serious going on, did we?
        </p>
        <p>
          How could I miss someone who ignored me half of the time? Someone who
          told me I was a mistake? I knew I was a mistake, but did he really
          have to say it like that? Like he didn't mean it but had to say it so
          we would have no reason to see each other again?
        </p>
        <p>
          Couldn't he just say, 'fuck off, we are nothing, you are better than
          me, and you messed up but made the right choice; I don't want to see
          you because whatever tension between us has faded, and you are better
          off without me.'
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, knowing Elio would never say words like that.</p>
        <p>
          I might have hurt him, but I probably should have been more honest. I
          should have made him listen to me. I talked him out of turning his
          lights off; why couldn't I talk him into listening to me?
        </p>
        <p>
          A week of these thoughts filtering in and out of my mind, taking my
          focus away from why we were really on this damn cruise in the first
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I messed up, but I didn't need my mind and thoughts of him to
          remind me that I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was funny because a week ago, I didn't realize that I liked hearing
          his voice or liked his accent. I didn't realize he had different
          facial expressions when explaining something to me and being a smart
          ass. My mind had registered that he had a beautiful smile, but only
          now was my brain catching up to the fact that it wasn't only beautiful
          but addictive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never knew I used to say things to get on his nerves, so he would
          scowl to hide a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't realize that he had a little frown on his brows when thinking
          or that he liked looking at me—specifically, my hair. It was the first
          thing his eyes always latched on to before he drank in my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I probably didn't realize because I was staring at him, trying to see
          if there was a difference between the suit he wore the day before and
          the one he wore at that moment or if his lashes had grown longer than
          they were the day before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Odd how a week was all it took to make me admit that maybe it wasn't
          just his touch, the sex, or the fucking tension. Maybe it was
          just...him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe I was so high on him that I became insufferable to everyone
          around me. I knew I had to fix it since the man didn't return my
          calls, texts, or voicemails.
        </p>
        <p>But before then, I would have to tell Devil.</p>
        <p>
          He was one of the reasons Elio turned a 180 and ended everything
          before I had any fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could be a matter of getting Elio out of my system. I had a taste
          that wasn't enough, a taste that had me thirsting for more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or maybe I needed to stop being fucking blind and accept that it
          wasn't my thirst but my longing to have a meaningful or stupid
          conversation with him where he tried to prove me wrong in an argument
          by stating silly facts that I didn't give a shit about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things had been hushed from his end, and I wasn't even wondering why
          he wasn't making any moves to get the painting if he knew where it
          was. I only cared about him...what he was doing, how he was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did he give up on setting things right with Devil because of me? Did
          he really think I purposefully ruined them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Does he see me as a mistake; and when he said that, did he mean the
          sex or just me in general?
        </p>
        <p>Why am I overthinking this?</p>
        <p>
          At what point did I lose control of my feelings? The time in the
          bathtub? When we ate together? When he took me to his house in Turin?
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, slipping the gun right back underneath my pillow just as the
          door to my room pushed open.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had booked a suite on the cruise, five bedrooms, and a lounge. It
          was the silver suite, seeing as we didn't want to be wasteful and go
          for the gold suite that came with a pool, seven bedrooms, and a living
          room, or the platinum that came with a pool, a private club, a game
          room, ten bedrooms, a living room, lounge area, and kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog wanted that, but he thought better when he saw the bill to get a
          platinum suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed my headphones and turned slightly toward Milk, who stood by
          the door, dressed casually. "Hey, we're heading out of the suite to
          eat; you coming?"
        </p>
        <p>I plastered a small smile on my lips. "No, I'm good."</p>
        <p>
          She watched me with a look of worry. "You want us to get you
          anything?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm good, thanks."</p>
        <p>"It's food, Zahra." she clarified.</p>
        <p>
          I breathed out a small laugh. "Yeah, I know, I don't think I have an
          appetite; you guys go ahead," I sunk further into the bed. "Have fun,"
          I told her, trying to sound cheerful, but it came out half-assed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She sighed loudly and then threw her head back and yelled. "You guys
          go on without me and Zahra; get us food, we'll hang back!"
        </p>
        <p>"Got it!" Upper yelled back from somewhere behind her.</p>
        <p>
          "You don't have to do that," I was saying as she entered the room,
          closing the door behind her and kicking off her sneakers before
          walking over and getting on the bed with me. "Seriously, go have fun,"
          I said as she got under the covers and scooted closer, hugging me in a
          spoon-like cuddle from behind.
        </p>
        <p>"It won't be fun without you there."</p>
        <p>
          I groaned, but my appreciation for her staying behind caused a swirl
          of warmth in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't like sappy shit like this," I murmured, relaxing back into
          the pillow as her chin went to rest on my shoulder, and we lay there.
        </p>
        <p>"I like sappy shit; deal with it."</p>
        <p>I allowed a smile curl unto my lips.</p>
        <p>
          "You've been sad since we left the compound, don't think we haven't
          noticed. I gave you time and space to tell me or anyone of us
          yourself, but it seems you won't do that on your own."
        </p>
        <p>"I've not been sad." I tried to wave it off.</p>
        <p>"You've been eating once every day for the past week."</p>
        <p>
          I chuckled, falling deep into her body. "Just because I eat once daily
          doesn't mean I'm sad."
        </p>
        <p>"You never say no to food."</p>
        <p>I managed a shrug. "I guess I'm just having a bad week."</p>
        <p>
          "You can tell me, Zahra," she said softly, genuinely. "Whatever it is,
          I'll try to help you sort it out. Anything to get you out of your sad
          funk." She hugged me tighter, intertwining our fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Telling her didn't ultimately seem out of an option. If I was going to
          tell Devil, there was no way none of them wouldn't have found out
          either way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, I needed some Milk unhinged and unfiltered advice. I was
          contemplating whether now was the best time to tell Devil or not. I
          needed a boost of confidence, a vote of go-ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, the heaviness remaining in place as I turned so we could
          face each other but still cuddle.
        </p>
        <p>"Promise you won't freak out," I said softly.</p>
        <p>
          She pressed her lips together, eyes searching mine as she went
          suspiciously quiet for a few seconds before she spoke. "Honestly, it
          depends."
        </p>
        <p>"Come on, Milk."</p>
        <p>"I won't freak out." She sounded firm with a single nod.</p>
        <p>I let out a breath.</p>
        <p>"I think I like someone I shouldn't like."</p>
        <p>Her eyes widened instantly. "Devil? I thought it was over with—"</p>
        <p>"No, not Devil—"</p>
        <p>Her nose scrunched up. "Dog?"</p>
        <p>"God, no." I laughed. "Why the fuck would you think that?"</p>
        <p>She shrugged, "I know it can't be Upper, so—oh my God...Me?"</p>
        <p>I shook my head. "No, it's not you."</p>
        <p>Now she looked confused. "Then who?"</p>
        <p>I swallowed. "Devil's brother."</p>
        <p>
          Her brows drew further down together. "Devil's..." she trailed off,
          but then her brows shot up in surprise. "Oh." She said as realization
          brightened her eyes. "Oh..." but then confusion took over again. "Oh?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah. Shocker." I said, resting my head further into the pillow as
          Milk got on her elbow so she could look down at me.
        </p>
        <p>"You like Elio." She stated.</p>
        <p>"I think I do,"</p>
        <p>
          "You think? You've been moping around for a week because of him. There
          is nothing to think; oh my God, you like him. You like him? Why the
          hell do you like him? What has been happening? Why didn't I notice?
          Wait—that one time I came to your room and found only pillows arranged
          as you on your bed, were you—with him?"
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "What time?"</p>
        <p>
          She got upright. "Dog said you were probably at the roof, but I
          didn't—"
        </p>
        <p>I sat up. "Dog?"</p>
        <p>
          She breathed out. "I don't know when exactly this was, I can't really
          remember, but I came to your room, and you weren't there. Instead,
          there were pillows. So I brought Dog in because I thought he might
          know why you snuck out, but he told me you were at the rooftop right
          after he made me search for your stash of weed—obviously, we didn't
          find it. But damn—" a grin split across her face. "You're smooth."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at her. "Wow," I said, raking my hair back from my face.
          "Why didn't you ask me about it afterward?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She shrugged. "There wasn't really anything to ask—but hell, Zahra,
          that is not the point right now; how did it start? Do you think he
          likes you too? Why did it end?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "It was harmless flirting at first, but then well—wipe that
          fucking smile off your face."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm surprised," she cooed, shifting closer to me. "I mean, you like
          someone...I don't know why I like that you like someone; I just do.
          And hell—Elio Marino? That's huge! He's so fucking hot. Are you
          joking?"
        </p>
        <p>"I wish I was."</p>
        <p>
          An excited goofy grin touched her lips, "So, did you guys like..." she
          wiggled her brows. "How was the sex?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I groaned. "It was..." I trailed off and closed my eyes. I could still
          smell him, feel his touch, feel him...I didn't know when a sigh left
          my lips. "It was elite. So fucking elite." I peeled my eyes open. "I
          didn't remember my name for the first few minutes; I felt so soft
          afterward. You know when you have sex with someone, and you just feel
          soft everywhere when you finish."
        </p>
        <p>"Cum high," she said with a dreamy sigh.</p>
        <p>"There, that's the word."</p>
        <p>
          She did a little excited jump. "I had a feeling after that art
          exhibit. I could feel tension from the other end of our comm. I should
          have paid more attention."
        </p>
        <p>I shrugged.</p>
        <p>
          She must have sensed my sudden resignation. She tucked her hair behind
          her ear. "So what happened?"
        </p>
        <p>"He called it off."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"I kissed Devil. On the bus."</p>
        <p>
          She sucked in a breath. "I didn't know that." she said, "Upper doesn't
          know that; Upper cannot know that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, but It wasn't anything serious; he was just trying to help
          me. Elio found out, and he thought I was messing with him this whole
          time."
        </p>
        <p>A sad frown took over her face. "Did you explain?"</p>
        <p>
          "I tried to. He didn't wanna hear, although—this isn't my issue, I'll
          fix it. I need to know how to tell Devil before I fix it. I don't want
          anything to come back and bite me in the ass."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, that's true. He should know. If you plan to take things
          seriously with Elio, then...you have to. No secrets; secrets ruin
          relationships."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "He might get mad. Like, really pissed because he told me to
          stay away from Elio, and I did the opposite."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Devil's gone for Upper, Zahra. He might not care; trust me on this."
        </p>
        <p>"But he—"</p>
        <p>
          She held my hand in hers. "Why are you acting like a fucking chicken?
          The Zahra I know wouldn't give two fucks about what Devil would think.
          He doesn't own you, and you do not owe him anything. No friendship
          quota said you couldn't bone his brother. If you like someone, you
          should be with them."
        </p>
        <p>
          An odd kind of nervousness took over me. It was so out of character,
          so fucking stupid. "What if I don't know if I should be with them?
          Fuck, I sound so pathetic, like a girl who likes a boy. I hate this."
        </p>
        <p>She laughed, "It's normal, Zahra. You're blooming now."</p>
        <p>"Fuck off."</p>
        <p>
          "Right, right, do you want to be with Elio? You really want to fix
          it?"
        </p>
        <p>"I think..."</p>
        <p>"Give it to me straight."</p>
        <p>"I do."</p>
        <p>
          Her hand squeezed mine. "Then put a sock in it. Tell Devil, give him
          the middle finger if he tries to fault you for liking someone, and
          then we strategize on how you can get your man."
        </p>
        <p>"Don't get ahead of yourself there; Elio is <i>not</i> my man."</p>
        <p>
          "Sorry, just the high from the pep talk." She spoke. "But hey, I'm
          sure it'll be fine."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah..." I nodded. "Yeah...I'm overthinking it."</p>
        <p>
          "Exactly." She said, "I still can't believe we are having an actual
          conversation about a guy...we never do this."
        </p>
        <p>I smiled softly. "Yeah, I've never liked a guy before so...."</p>
        <p>"Did you call or text him since we left?"</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, reaching for my phone and pulling up my chat box for Elio's
          contact. "I texted several times, no response," I said as Milk
          collected the phone from me, scrolling down, her eyes widened as she
          kept on scrolling. "He hasn't blocked me yet, it's on delivered, but
          he never checks it. Do you know what that means?"
        </p>
        <p>"Uh..." she kept on scrolling.</p>
        <p>"What is it?"</p>
        <p>"I'm wondering why he hasn't blocked you."</p>
        <p>
          "What? Why?" I inched my head forward to peer at the screen of my
          phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          She dropped the phone on her lap, looking up at me and shaking her
          head. "You spammed him, Zahra; you keep spamming him. The last message
          you sent was from a few minutes ago. It doesn't spell cool."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But he didn't respond, and I got anxious, okay? When I text someone,
          and they don't reply, it just makes me all itchy, and it has been a
          week, and he hasn't blocked me, so that means there is still room for
          me to explain...or does it mean he doesn't find me worthy enough to
          block?"
        </p>
        <p>"You're overthinking it again. Maybe he's just busy?"</p>
        <p>"For a week?"</p>
        <p>
          "Maybe he doesn't check his phone, see? He hasn't opened them yet. So,
          I don't think there's anything much to worry about; you're good."
        </p>
        <p>"But I—"</p>
        <p>
          The door pushed open, grabbing me and Milk's attention as we turned to
          see Dog. "He's here."
        </p>
        <p>"Who's here?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>
          "The man who is in charge of Arturo's manor, the private institution
          manager, the Arabian philanthropist who is—"
        </p>
        <p>"We get it," I stated. "Shit. How's his surrounding looking."</p>
        <p>"He got a Platinum suite." Dog scowled.</p>
        <p>"That's not what I asked," I said.</p>
        <p>
          "He's not alone, some family members, fellow philanthropists in the
          big seats, hot as fuck women in their little waist chains and fucking
          sexy eyes underneath veils and face chains, and I think there's gonna
          be a dance performance at some private event in the suite, I don't
          know, but it's pretty elite, we need an in."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra can go in as one of the dancers," Milk blurted.</p>
        <p>
          I smiled sweetly at her. "That's awesome, Milk; it's totally okay to
          speak for me; I love you so much; you're the best," I said in a dry
          tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          She rolled her eyes. "I've seen you dance, you rock, and it'll get you
          out of your funk."
        </p>
        <p>"You saw me drunk, dancing on a table because I was out of it."</p>
        <p>
          "It was sexy as fuck," Dog voiced, leaning against the door. "I think
          I got a boner that time, all you need to do is give the target a
          boner, and viola, you get an invite to tour the manor, and you sneak
          us in or introduce us as your adoptive siblings because your father
          loved helping people. Man charmed, painting ours, map collected, gold
          ours. Easy as pie."
        </p>
        <p>Milk nodded excitedly.</p>
        <p>"How do we get into the private event."</p>
        <p>
          "Devil is working his magic, and Upper is assisting." Dog informed.
        </p>
        <p>"How long do we have till the performance?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>"I don't know, about an hour?" Dog answered.</p>
        <p>
          Milk smiled creepily at me, her hand raising to stroke my cheek as I
          inched back warily. "That's enough time to turn you into a Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>Fuck.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          It took Dog getting rid of the lead dancer and me entering the back
          room as a backup from another dance crew when the other two dancers
          were freaking out. Milk was with me, so we quickly did my makeup and
          got the lead dancer's dress and jewelry while the backup dancers
          filled me in on what they had planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no time to practice, and they assured me it wasn't that
          hard; they even showed a video of their practice and told me they
          would be more of a background setup because everyone would be paying
          attention to one thing or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like dancing. It wasn't a skill I learned out of personal
          preference. The times I had to do this were because I had to draw
          people's attention to my body and fetch money.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped my thoughts from moving past that point as I stared at my
          reflection in the mirror. The veil chain covered half of my face and
          my forehead, only my eyes on display, make up a little on the heavy
          side, but appropriate enough for this whole costume.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey," Milk's hand fell on my shoulder, "are you okay?"</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, getting to my feet, ignoring my stomach and half of my waist
          on display. "I'm good."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one would be paying attention. I took a sneak peek at the event;
          people are packed, and I don't think anyone is listening to the band
          playing. It's one of those background noises but visual."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay, I'm ready." I turned to the backup dancers, two girls who
          looked about my age, fixing each other's jewelry pieces. "You guys
          good?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes." One of them answered.</p>
        <p>
          "I was hoping Anita's stomach ache subsided before it was time," the
          smaller one said. "She practiced so hard for this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, poor Anita," I said distractedly, picking up my phone and
          sending another. <b>'Can we talk? Text me back' </b>message to Elio.
          It was delivered.
        </p>
        <p>I waited a few seconds for a response, but nothing came.</p>
        <p>
          Milk snatched the phone from my hand with a glare. "You would be a
          clingy girlfriend, and that was not what I expected you to be," She
          said. "It's pathetic."
        </p>
        <p>"I know. I'm just stressed."</p>
        <p>"Let's get through this first, okay?"</p>
        <p>I nodded. <i>Let's get through this.</i></p>
        <p>
          The place was packed, as Milk said; I was grateful for the dim
          lighting and the chatter of people around.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we got on stage, I allowed my body to get familiar with the
          environment, let my eyes roam the crowd, the men in free clothing,
          women in little clothing, and the air chill; you could tell only rich
          people littered the area, the smell of expensive perfumes, calculating
          smiles, expensive drinks in elite looking wine glasses.
        </p>
        <p>My eyes zeroed in on the target.</p>
        <p>
          Kareem Fadel. Late 50s. Rich to the nines, the philanthropist of all
          philanthropists. This man sought perfection, enchantment, and
          orderliness. He saw people for who they were, hence why he was who he
          was and still breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Word from the people was that he was kind-hearted; he shared his
          things as if the people he helped were family. It was admirable.
        </p>
        <p>And I had to ace this at the first trial.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey," I called to the two girls. "I'll give you both 1 million
          dollars each if you get off this stage and leave this to me?"
        </p>
        <p>I spotted the frown on their faces.</p>
        <p>"You have that kind of money?" one asked.</p>
        <p>"And more, if you want. Quick decisions. We don't have time."</p>
        <p>"You're not some assassin, are you?"</p>
        <p>"Do I look like I carry a fucking gun with me?"</p>
        <p>One of them shook their head.</p>
        <p>
          "Awesome. Are you leaving? Or no? It's either 1 million each, or I
          fuck up this dance and have you on Kareem's bad side. Time is
          ticking."
        </p>
        <p>
          They looked uncertain at first but then hopped quietly off the stage.
          I spotted the DJ frowning at them and then at me with confusion. I
          nodded for him to carry on.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes settled on Kareem again as the lights around the room started
          getting darker; I swallowed my nerves, about to look away, when
          something silver glinted beside Kareem.
        </p>
        <p>Rings.</p>
        <p>Familiar rings.</p>
        <p>
          My head snapped up a bit, and I caught his gaze from the small
          distance; just when the lights around the room turned a dark red, and
          a bright white spotlight centered on me, the intro to the Arabian
          sound started playing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio Marino was sitting there, right beside Kareem, brows drawn down
          slightly with what I could see as suspicion, confusion, and surprise.
        </p>
        <p>Shit.</p>
        <p>
          I collected myself with great difficulty, getting my head back on
          track as I attuned my body to the music and tore my gaze from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Background fucking noise, my ass; I could hear the chatters die down,
          heads turning my way, the music and me being the only thing catching
          people's attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I got out of this alive and unscathed, I would kill Milk. And I
          would enjoy it thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>
          My foul thoughts calm me as I let the music own my body, becoming a
          partner with every rising and falling note.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman who taught us this technique had said the waist movement was
          the power of the dance, but most importantly, you had to let the music
          talk to your body; I worked on my hand placement, twirling my wrists
          with the beat of the traditional goblet drums, the echoes of the
          flute, mixed with the luring of the oud, and then attuned my body
          until it became one and the same with the enchanting secrets of the
          music.
        </p>
        <p>
          I twirled my waist and lifted my hips to the language of the
          instruments, freed the muscles around my hands and neck, letting my
          ankles and pad of my feet get familiar with the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was no Milk, but a dance like this could break any tension in a
          room, seduce any man or woman who bore witness; it could touch souls
          that never bargained to be touched.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes on me had doubled in number, and I made eye contact with
          several people, loving the way wine glasses were stopped an inch
          before lips, too distracted by the dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sensual hypnotism was real, and it was a weapon I didn't wield often.
          But now I had Kareem's undivided attention and knew I had gotten us
          that invite.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted to Elio, once again catching his stare. This time, I
          didn't look away as I put on a show for him, going extra soft with my
          movements, my hands feeling up my hips to the deep in my waist, where
          he liked to touch me, then I dragged my gentle caress to the side of
          my breasts before moving up my neck where his lips had once made a
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes followed my hands, and I felt my skin heat up under his
          lustful scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          A smile curled onto my lips as I flattened my palm, dragging it up my
          neck to my chin as I twirled my head around, moving my waist in the
          other direction as we neared the end of the performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dancers had informed me that we were never to go near Kareem, but
          I knew my mission would be successful if he called to me right after.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the way he watched me like a piece of art, I should have
          absolutely no problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finishing lure of the music had my legs taking me around in a
          sensual twirl, aligning my hips movement with my wrist, stomach, and
          waist, slow and steady at first before I increased pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt like I was falling with the music. A possession I knew was
          contagious, contagious to the point that I wasn't ultimately surprised
          when my last move after the music came to a dramatic abrupt stop,
          slapped on a graveyard silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted to the entrance of the backroom to catch Milk standing
          there, jaw hanging as she looked at me, unblinking, entirely still.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single hard clap had my attention drawing back to Kareem, who was on
          his feet, clapping with a massive smile on his face, shaking his head
          as his eyes gleamed with astonishment; his clapping brought everyone
          out of their daze as they joined in with chants of appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>Kareem made his way over, extending his hand toward me.</p>
        <p>
          I placed my hand atop his too-soft ones, the wrinkles by his eyes
          pronounced as he kissed my knuckles. "You were <i>Beautiful. </i>It
          was an honor to watch you," He said as he led me off the stage, and
          another band started setting themselves up.
        </p>
        <p>"It was an honor to dance for you, Kareem."</p>
        <p>
          He laughed boisterously, hand to his stomach as he sat down and
          ushered me onto his lap.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze slipped to Elio, whose eyes turned purposefully away from us,
          his jaw clenched hard as he lit a thick cigar, placing it between his
          lips, cheeks hollowing as he sucked in the smoke like he wanted it to
          get into his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You flatter me," the man said with a grin, his hand moving up my
          hips, an action that seemed to grab Elio's attention. Those eyes
          finally rose to catch my gaze as he let the smoke out of his mouth.
          Thick and white, mixed with the atmosphere, was the same color as his
          eyes. "What is the name, beautiful?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra." I supplied, looking away from the man who I felt was seconds
          away from yanking me away from this position, away from this event. To
          kill me? Kiss me? Fuck me? His eyes said it all.
        </p>
        <p>All hope isn't lost.</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," Kareem pronounced with each intonation of the name, "I must
          say, you rival my wives. What would it take to wed you so you can
          dance like that for me every day? I have never seen a performance that
          spoke directly to my soul."
        </p>
        <p>
          I flattened my hand on his chest. "It would be most desirable to wed a
          man as generous as you are and a sin to deny such a proposal, but I
          already have someone who speaks to my soul, just like the music did."
        </p>
        <p>Elio looked away from us.</p>
        <p>
          Kareem smiled. "It is a shame. Your someone is fortunate; They should
          kiss the ground you walk on. If they don't, you should leave them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I laughed wistfully. "If only that were possible, Kareem, The man in
          question complements my being; you can't leave someone like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio raised his gaze, locking eyes with me from underneath his lashes,
          his face still wore no expression, but those eyes...the way he looked
          at me like he could see an apology in my stare. It made me feel warm
          all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          He broke the connection by looking down, lashes shadowing below his
          eyes, thanks to the lightning.
        </p>
        <p>So...maybe all hope was lost.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, I believe you haven't met my companion today," Kareem said,
          gesturing to Elio. "This is Elio Marino, the most genuine and generous
          man I have ever met."
        </p>
        <p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Marino."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." Elio supplied with what could be considered a nod if you looked
          clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kareem regarded him with a smile. "What did you think of the
          performance, Marino?"
        </p>
        <p>"Good."</p>
        <p>This mother—</p>
        <p>
          Kareem laughed, looking back at me. "A 'good' from him is like
          heaven's blessing. He is a man of few words."
        </p>
        <p>"I can see that. Thank you for your very kind words, Sir."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          He put the cigar between his lips again, indicating he was done
          talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kareem indulged me in a conversation about how he was excited to be on
          the cruise; he also invited me to all of his events here and within
          Mexico by the end of the cruise.
        </p>
        <p>I knew I had him wrapped around my finger.</p>
        <p>Mission accomplished—for that part.</p>
        <p>Elio didn't speak once, almost like we were non-existent.</p>
        <p>
          He only looked at me when I rose to get myself a strong drink at the
          bar. I had taken off my veil at a request from Kareem.
        </p>
        <p>
          It irked me that Elio pretended I wasn't there half the time. So I
          sufficed by getting myself something strong while receiving
          appreciative stares for my performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the shot the bartender placed in front of me and threw it down
          my throat. The tension in my muscles relaxed almost immediately at the
          burn from the alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra Faizan."</p>
        <p>
          The drink almost came back up my throat as my head snapped to the
          side, and the burn became hotter when my eyes took in the person the
          voice belonged to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bright, almost blue eyes stared back at me, a small crooked smile on
          his lips as he leaned against the bar, gloved hands like his cousins',
          holding a whiskey glass. He wore a dark grey long-sleeved shirt that
          pronounced his biceps, and black slacks, over solid thighs, a familiar
          form I did not expect to see here.
        </p>
        <p>A form I should <i>not</i> see here.</p>
        <p>"Vitale Conti," I stated.</p>
        <p>
          "That was quite a performance. To think you were holding out on me all
          those times."
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost like I could feel his eyes on me, I turned in Elio's direction
          to see him watching.
        </p>
        <p><i>This is not good.</i></p>
        <p>
          I looked back at Vitale, Martino's distant cousin, a year older than I
          was, intelligent, relentless, and not so fucking foolish. Which had me
          trying to figure out why the fuck he was here.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How is Conti these days?" I asked, even though I couldn't hide the
          discomfort in my body if I tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Surviving," Vitale said, bringing the glass to his lips without
          looking away from me as he took a sip. "How are you these days?" He
          asked after taking a drink, swirling the content on the glass with a
          precise movement from his wrists.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Surviving," I responded as he watched me with those calculating eyes.
          I looked around before settling my focus on him. "What are you doing
          here?"
        </p>
        <p>"What is everybody doing here? I'm having a good time."</p>
        <p>"Vitale." I voice warned.</p>
        <p>
          "I wanted to see you," he stated, dropping the glass on the table and
          moving closer to me. I inched back on instinct; the resemblance he
          bore to Martino always had a way of making me raise my guard. "I see
          some things never change," he said softly.
        </p>
        <p>"You shouldn't be here."</p>
        <p>
          "You shouldn't be here too. It has been years, Zahra. My patience is
          growing very thin."
        </p>
        <p>"Your statement has a tone that I do not like,"</p>
        <p>
          His hand wrapped around my arm suddenly, yanking me closer to him. "I
          am not your puppet." His grip tightened into a painful grasp. "I hold
          the other end of this fucking string, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing."</p>
        <p>"I am at my width's end with you. We had a deal."</p>
        <p>"And it's still standing."</p>
        <p>"Is it?"</p>
        <p>"Vitale—"</p>
        <p>
          "Problem?" Elio's voice had my heart almost flying out of my throat as
          Vitale let go of my arm but didn't take his eyes off me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a few steps back from him as I swallowed, looking up at Elio.
          "N-no problem,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale picked up his glass and then looked at Elio, the taunting smile
          back on his face. "We were just having a friendly catch-up."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze dropped to the reddening bruise on my arm and then to me;
          something cold and vacant reflected in his eyes as he looked back at
          Vitale, the whiskey glass in his hand, the sharp edge of the counter,
          and then Vitale's neck.
        </p>
        <p>How could one speak and show without speaking and showing?</p>
        <p>
          The smile on Vitale's face faltered, a frown pushing into it, probably
          sensing Elio was painting a picture with his stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale did not do well with threats. They were merely a challenge to
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this challenge might very well get him killed, and that will not
          happen. Not on my watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stepped closer to Elio. "It's fine; we were just catching up. We
          haven't seen each other in years." It wasn't a lie, but Elio didn't
          budge or take his eyes off Vitale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I focused on the foolish one who couldn't see his own life
          flashing before his eyes, "Vitale, <i>please</i>,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon me speaking, Vitale stood straighter. "I'll go explore the party.
          Nice seeing you here again, Zahra," and then he raised his glass to
          Elio with a slight nod and that damn smile. "Marino,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He brushed past after giving me one last pointed stare and saying,
          "Call me sometime."
        </p>
        <p>Elio's eyes followed him until he was out of sight.</p>
        <p>
          I let out a breath that had been clogging my airway. "He was Marti—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio raised a finger, stopping my statement without looking at me. "Do
          not...speak to me," he said, turning to leave, but my hand flew out to
          grab his arm as I moved to stand before him.
        </p>
        <p>"I want to speak to you."</p>
        <p>"I gave you a chance. Multiple times."</p>
        <p>
          "I know, but just give me another one; I'll clear everything up," I
          said, my eyes searching his vacant ones. "Please? A benefit of the
          doubt?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away from me, his jaw clenching like this very request was
          the last thing he wanted to grant.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you still don't want to speak to me after I explain everything
          that went on in that bus, I promise I'll back off." I pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few seconds, he looked down at me again, stretching the
          silence before he nodded. "Okay," he said, gesturing his head towards
          the entrance. "Come with me."

        <p>
          <b>SOCIAL GATHERINGS </b>and I were like enemies who would never find
          common ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was why I had asked Gemma to accompany me when we arrived at the
          cruise three days ago. I wasn't ultimately surprised when I decided to
          leave for Mexico upon a spontaneous decision to get Casmiro off my
          back. Still, it was mildly inexpedient because my preferred arrival
          time had been the day Kareem was arriving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo had joined me the day after I had arrived to give me the intel
          on Kareem; drop off his bags in one of the rooms, a furry black cat,
          Mimi, whom he dropped with me because he didn't want to leave her with
          a stranger, due to his mothers' unavailability.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had returned to Milan and then to Turin for in-house business but
          will hasten it up because, he said, and I quote. "The last thing I
          want to return to is a cat with a bullet in its stomach."
        </p>
        <p>
          That was a wise decision, but he wasn't aware Gemma was an expert in
          taking care of cats, he wasn't aware of Gemma at all, or Sailor whom
          she brought along and dropped in my suite the following day, so Mimi
          wouldn't be '<i>sad</i> <i>and</i> <i>alone</i>.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not understand her logic, but she seemed to believe what she was
          saying, so I let her handle it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo had missed Gemma by an hour, she went out to explore when he
          arrived, and I saw no reasonable use to divulge the information that I
          did not arrive alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma had been a little wary when I told her about the trip and asked
          her to accompany me. She also said, and I quote. "You're rich?" to
          which I responded. "I am comfortable."
        </p>
        <p>
          After which, she interrogated me about my job, and I supplied her
          with, "I am into business politics." And then I had to proof it to her
          by showing catalog upon catalog where my name had been mentioned under
          various business strategies for Milan, to which she had stared at me
          wide-eyed and asked. "Why the hell are you friends with me?" I ignored
          her statement politely, and we eventually ended up traveling together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro had wanted to come with me, but I had asked him to stay back
          due to his health issues—as per my clandestine discretion to remove
          his watchful eye from my actions, now that he knew about
          <i>my</i> health issues—The stubborn man fought me on it until I
          decided that if I needed him, he would be the first I would call.
          Although he had told me he would arrive either way if that call took
          longer than he liked. 'damn compound affairs, I would have my right
          hand hold the fort.' He had said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agreed because if things went as planned with Kareem, I would not
          need to stay in Mexico for that extended period, and if I was lucky
          enough, I might not get to mourn through the first morning in
          December.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time in years, I could taste the achievement of my goal.
          I could touch, see, and feel it. The thought satisfied me; it covered
          a need I didn't know I needed. It had me feeling lighter than usual.
        </p>
        <p>No distractions.</p>
        <p>No STREET.</p>
        <p>No Elia.</p>
        <p>No...<i>Zahra</i>.</p>
        <p>
          My thoughts halted to a stop...a meaningless head silence that sent
          the reality of my situation crashing down on me.
        </p>
        <p><i>No Zahra.</i></p>
        <p>
          I finished the bourbon in the glass, pouring myself another. I could
          feel Kareem's stare, but I didn't look over. Gemma hadn't accompanied
          me to this event; she was at the other axis at some party she had been
          invited to by strangers she claimed were her people. So, I had to live
          through this gathering with alcohol and cigars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The things I had to do to get what I wanted. It would only make the
          final moment worth it. Endurance built anticipation, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I must say," Kareem started, "When I invited you, I didn't think you
          would show."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Hm."</p>
        <p>"Why did you show?" He asked, curious.</p>
        <p>
          "There are two cats in my suite; it was either me throwing them into
          the ocean or coming here."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kareem laughed like my words were coated in pink fluff. "You have
          pets."
        </p>
        <p>"No. My...friends have pets."</p>
        <p>
          "The things we do for friendship." He mused aloud. "Are your friends
          here tonight?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "Why didn't you bring them? This party might be elite, but it is open
          to friends of my friends."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "I will bring them to the next one," I said, even though I
          had no intention of coming to the next one...
        </p>
        <p>
          Kareem sighed satisfyingly as I watched him look around with a big
          smile on his face, taking in the crowd of people all gathered around,
          carefree like the rest of the world didn't matter—only this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had felt that way several times, but the scenario always featured a
          book or the woman I never hoped to see again. Once this deal with
          Kareem is implemented, I will ensure no one else got to the painting
          before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after I had completed my goal, I would arrange for the gold to be
          sent to STREET on my behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mexico," Kareem said, "There's always this air of liberty in it. The
          night is always alive, and the people's smiles are so contagious it
          could make any sad man smile." He said, a wistful look in his eyes. "I
          am glad I came. Thank you for approaching with this deal."
        </p>
        <p>"It benefits the both of us."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," Kareem grinned. "The Garza manor is not inviting because it is
          ever refurbished and painted. It was the man who lived there, the
          people who cared for it. The love and the smiles on their faces when
          they maintain it, the children who wander the halls and get awed by
          the artworks and sculptures, family portraits and endless stories."
        </p>
        <p>"Indeed."</p>
        <p>
          "When I reviewed your plans, I was filled with joy; I knew I had to
          look into it. I knew Arturo would want that. And coming from you, whom
          he spoke highly of; who was I to turn down your proposal?"
        </p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          Kareem's grin turned into a small smile. "I see a brightness in you,
          Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him. The sudden change in the dialogue direction took me
          off guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You look surprised." He chuckled richly. "I know a good person when I
          see one. I am not blindsided by what you do or what your business
          truly entails, politics is a dangerous field, and you would have to do
          equally dangerous things, but I see past that. Just the same way
          Arturo had seen it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I wondered what that man had told this one about me. But I didn't want
          to ask. I did not truly desire to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are set for great things, Marino. Your name should be more than
          what it is." The man said, looking at me like he was looking through
          my soul, seeing the person I barely recognized anymore. "You should be
          setting paces, examples; if you can just touch upon that part of
          yourself, you will do good work."
        </p>
        <p>I indulged him by nodding, hoping he was finished talking.</p>
        <p>
          "Ignore the rumors here and there about you. Only you know who you
          truly are."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded yet again.</p>
        <p>
          "If there is anything you need, even if it is my prayers, give me a
          call, or an email, I will answer."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          He grinned at me, refilling his glass as I looked around, his words
          playing inside my head, clashing with every intention I had for
          myself; it made me feel open, uncomfortable...I did not like it, and
          the reason was still a blur to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed the change of lights around, the music that had been
          playing, reduced in volume as my gaze sought something new to focus
          on, some form of distraction—I stopped my search when my attention
          settled on the stage where three people climbed on, dressed in
          traditional Arabian attires...
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody was paying attention, not even Kareem, as he talked to someone
          other than me, who had managed to catch his attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus was drawn to that stage, my mind a mist into itself as I
          studied the women getting into formation, the atmosphere already
          beginning to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tether in my body drew my focus to the one in the middle. That
          height. That skin tone. That waist. That aura. It couldn't be
          possible...I frowned, watching closely...It couldn't be her. I knew my
          mind was prone to playing tricks on me, supplying false images and
          troubling memories, but it wasn't too late into the night; I wasn't
          trying to sleep naturally; I was awake, barely intoxicated.
        </p>
        <p>And she was here.</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes, accentuated to form a dept that spoke directly to the
          unsuspecting atmosphere around her, scanned the room like it was an
          opponent she wanted to conquer.
        </p>
        <p>
          How I recognized her with that veil was proof enough that I had been
          swimming with an inept delusion, telling myself that the last I saw of
          her was actually the last I would ever see of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why I was surprised? I couldn't precisely pinpoint. There was this
          curl of excitement and wary in my stomach, so tight that I had to
          battle with the expression I delivered to anyone who could see me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched the way she took a step back, her exposed, thin but curvy
          waist swaying with her movement as she summoned the attention of the
          women behind her. I could tell she was saying something, and the frown
          on the faces of her companions spoke volumes of their discomfort with
          what she was saying.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't last long because they seemed to agree on whatever she had
          proposed, and they were getting off the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched how she slowly gathered her confidence, looking in my
          direction but not at me. Kareem was her target for the night. Not me.
          She didn't know I was here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The urge to get up and silently leave pulled firm at every gut feeling
          my being could muster. However, my curiosity and my barely controlled
          obsession with watching this woman do remotely anything had my grip
          clenching around the glass. I remained grounded in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was muddled as to why she was here and surprised as to why she was
          on that stage, dressed in a way that brought a different kind of heat
          to the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took only a slight shift in her gaze to catch my stare. The way
          those bright brown eyes took me in with surprise and shock affirmed my
          assumptions about her not knowing I was there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light around us dimed, and a bright spotlight was placed on her,
          giving me one of the most beguiling sights my eyes had ever gotten the
          pleasure to see.
        </p>
        <p><i>Wow</i>.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra was standing there, glowing, in all the glories known to be
          bestowed onto a human being...
        </p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>
          That explanation seemed too measly compared to what I was seeing...she
          was otherworldly; she deserved to breathe the same oxygen as gods and
          deities alike.
        </p>
        <p>The woman before me was too good to be in this environment.</p>
        <p>My daze quickly turned into a budding anger.</p>
        <p>
          The moment she took her eyes away from me, I looked around to see she
          hadn't only caught my attention but everyone else's, women and men,
          young and old, and she barely even moved, barely even blinked; her
          presence was enough to demand the attention of many.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the song started to play, I focused on her once more; I watched,
          astonished and taken with the way she seemed to blend in with the
          music, the stage the instruments, she owned every bit of this moment,
          and it felt like my lungs had finally succumbed to my ill will.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she moved, her hands working in sync with her waist, my mind, at
          this very moment, registered the fact that underestimating Zahra was
          like a sin one shouldn't ever commit. I was convinced she could
          do...anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way she moved. <i>The way this woman moved—</i>Seducing the music,
          teasing everyone in this room without touching them.
        </p>
        <p>I was amazed, dazed, aroused, proud, contented.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't have the luxury of looking anywhere else. I felt missing a
          second of this would seem like missing a vital bone required for easy
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her body spoke languages my mind's reasoning failed to comprehend.
        </p>
        <p>
          My lust was mixed with admiration and jealousy at the realization that
          not only me bore witness to this addictive poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poison—<i>God</i>—the poison was in the way she danced; one hip
          lift echoed in waves like a siren sound, a blessing, and a curse...My
          little witch didn't come to bewitch; she came to speak; and listen; I
          did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost like she sensed my thoughts—those eyes locked with mine, taking
          her time with her movement, adding a bit of fervor that increased my
          need for her. Those beautiful fingers felt up her hips to her waist, a
          silent message for me as she subtly reminded me how it felt to touch
          her like that, but her cruelty was a crime I was more than willing to
          forgive.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes followed her movement, and my fingers ached to touch her; my
          body burned with need, and my cock hardened with obscene arousal, one
          I wanted to abolish but, at the same time, sate.
        </p>
        <p>I was buried deep in lust for this woman, and I didn't care.</p>
        <p>
          My eyes didn't leave her even after the dance finished, and Kareem,
          alongside everyone else, clapped like they had just witnessed and
          experienced the same thing I had.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched as Kareem walked over to her, taking her hand as he led her
          towards me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's grand laughter over something Zahra might have said had me
          turning my head away.
        </p>
        <p>
          My growing anger flared up a little at the knowledge of Zahra sitting
          on his lap...<i>before</i> me.
        </p>
        <p>The utter disrespect.</p>
        <p>
          I grounded my teeth together, holding myself back from the vivid
          thoughts trying to dig their way into my brain as I proceeded to light
          a cigar, placed it between my lips, and sucked in the hotness until I
          felt the heat inside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I had no reason to feel this way, I knew I had put a stop to
          our little compromise, but it didn't erase how attached I had grown to
          her or the jealousy biting at my reserve inconveniently.
        </p>
        <p>I should leave.</p>
        <p>
          But I couldn't. Not with her still here. Unprotected with different
          eyes turning our way, intentions clear in their gaze. I'm aware she
          could protect herself, but that doesn't erase the fact that she was
          one of the most careless people I'd ever met.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You flatter me," at the sound of Kareem's voice and a movement from
          the corner of my eye, I turned to see his hand settling on her hip.
          She made no move indicating the movement unsettled her, and I couldn't
          help but look up, finding those eyes already on me, taking my reaction
          as I blew out the smoke I had sucked in, detesting every second of my
          stay here. "What is the name, beautiful?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," that voice I hadn't heard for a week met my ears in a
          caress—the urge to grab her off his lap, pull her out of this damn
          event, and forget why I called things quit, tugged at me, but I kept
          silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, I must say, you rival my wives. What would it take to wed you
          so you can dance like that for me every day? I have never seen a
          performance that spoke directly to my soul."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>This</i> conversation was beginning to make my anger evident on my
          face. Who in their right mind would make a proposal like that? More so
          to somebody, you do not know?
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her flatten her hand against his chest, and I had to remind
          myself that Kareem was old enough to be her father, and I needed him
          for other business.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then Zahra responded to his proposal: "It would be most desirable
          to wed a man as generous as you are and a sin to deny such a proposal,
          but I already have someone who speaks to my soul, just like the music
          did."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was quickly reminded of how easily she had me fooled by her
          relationship with my brother. I remembered why I broke things off, and
          I looked away from them, already deciding to leave; her safety wasn't—
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is a shame. Your someone is fortunate; They should kiss the ground
          you walk on. If they don't, you should leave them."
        </p>
        <p>
          She laughed like she was thinking of that someone. "If only that were
          possible, Kareem, The man in question complements my being; you can't
          leave someone like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there was a subtle tightness in my chest, remembering how I
          said those exact words to her. I looked towards them again and found
          her gaze on me, eyes for the first time, showing a little bit of
          vulnerability, a silent plea that showed she was talking about
          me...but this was the last thing I wanted; everything was going as
          planned.
        </p>
        <p>This was a distraction, one I couldn't afford. Not right now.</p>
        <p>
          I looked down, blinking back my focus on what mattered. It wasn't my
          heart; it wasn't my need. It wasn't my lust. It wasn't her smile. It
          wasn't her voice. It wasn't her presence. It wasn't <i>her</i>.
        </p>
        <p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Marino."</p>
        <p>
          My focus zoned into their conversation, and I realized I must have
          been introduced.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm," I said, barely lifting my head or reaching her gaze.</p>
        <p>"What did you think of the performance, Marino?" Kareem asked.</p>
        <p>"Good." I devalued.</p>
        <p>
          I tuned out the rest of their conversation, only muttering an
          acknowledgment when Zahra spoke to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she stood up to leave, I watched to see if she was leaving or if
          any of the STREET members were around the area to stay with her, but
          the woman had gone to the bar to get a drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loathed how eyes tracked her movement like she was a specimen they
          couldn't wait to get their hands on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could do things to those violating eyes belonging to men and women.
          The gore the results would bring. Food to my deranged soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I turned my eyes away from people looking at her, I found one of
          them already making a move to talk to her...they exchanged a few
          words...but her stance, her composure, something was off.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she glanced my way, it wasn't a glance for 'help me,' but a
          glance for, 'this can't be happening.'
        </p>
        <p>Whoever that man was, she knew him.</p>
        <p>
          She looked away from me and then back to him; I watched them for a few
          seconds before breaking contact when Kareem moved to shake my hand and
          thank me for coming to the event. And then, after a few exchanges, his
          attention was needed at another axis in the event, and he left.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I turned back in Zahra's direction, what I saw had me frowning.
          The man was grabbing her arm with a gloved hand, and she looked
          uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know how I'd been sitting watching them one second and was
          already halfway towards them the next.
        </p>
        <p>"Is it?" The man bit the question at her.</p>
        <p>"Vitale—"</p>
        <p>
          "Problem?" my voice cut into whatever conversation they had been
          having, making Zahra flinch. The man dropped her arm. But his eyes
          were still locked on hers while she stepped back, looking as
          comfortable as I felt with this man still breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "N-no problem." She <i>stuttered</i>, her cheeks flushed, her previous
          composure completely deformed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched the man pick up his drink. He was about two inches shorter
          than me, but when he removed his gaze from Sport, and looked at me,
          his stare was leveled, unflinching, unafraid, like he had been
          expecting my arrival. "We were just having a friendly catch-up."
        </p>
        <p>
          I tore my gaze from him and looked at the arm of the woman beside me,
          the bruise from his hold tainting her skin, tainting my control,
          tainting the shred of humanity I had brought into this event. I didn't
          hear or see anything or anyone; my focus returned to the man.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a thousand ways—<i>more</i> than a thousand ways I could
          kill him here and now—something quick, something sharp, something
          <i>painful</i>. The image slashing through my head tickled my brain;
          the anger flowing through my veins removed all rational thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly Arturo's manor didn't matter, suddenly I didn't care about
          burning it all, suddenly my goal in life was to kill this man, and I
          wouldn't be okay until I did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know what was happening; I knew Zahra was saying something to
          me and then to Vitale, who unfortunately turned his gaze from me—when
          I didn't get out of my head, even after he raised his glass in mock
          salute, said my name and walked away, I knew the deed had been done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him walk away, knowing there was no way he was getting out
          of this cruise alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he was out of sight, I got out of my head just in time for
          Zahra's voice to reach my head.
        </p>
        <p>"He was Marti—"</p>
        <p>
          I raised a finger, not bothering to regard her. "Do not..." I forced
          out. "Speak to me," I said, turning to leave, but her hand reached out
          to grip my arm, and she was in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regretful but determined eyes searched mine. "I want to speak to you,"
        </p>
        <p>"I gave you a chance." I reminded her, "Multiple times."</p>
        <p>
          A small breath left her parted lips. "I know, but just give me another
          one; I'll clear everything up." She said, sincerity lingering in her
          stare. "Please?" her voice softened, getting straight into my head. "A
          benefit of the doubt?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away, fighting my head, my gut, my heart, and my damn mind at
          the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you still don't want to speak to me after I explain everything
          that went on in that bus, I promise I'll back off," she added.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I wasn't strong enough to deny her this. All I had to do was
          remain passive; no matter what she said or revealed, I wouldn't
          acknowledge it. I couldn't afford any form of distraction for what I
          had planned.
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Okay, come with me."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          When we got to my suite, I looked around for the cats but couldn't
          find them, it appeared they were tucked somewhere around, and I
          appreciated that. I was in no mood to acknowledge their presence or
          answer questions.
        </p>
        <p>Zahra walked in, and I closed the door behind us.</p>
        <p>
          "Well—fuck, the platinum suite is fire," Zahra said, and I watched her
          take in the suite with awe. "Rich people do get away with everything—"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't have all night," I said.</p>
        <p>
          She turned around, startled at the sharpness in my voice as she sucked
          in a breath, and shifted on her feet, showing nervousness. "Wouldn't
          you, um—want to sit down first?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "Awesome, we're <i>doing it</i> standing." She grinned like she had
          made a joke I was supposed to understand.
        </p>
        <p>I stared blankly.</p>
        <p>
          "Get it?" her grin faltered. "Doing it...standing? Like doing...it."
        </p>
        <p>Blank stare.</p>
        <p>"No?" her smile died as she cleared her throat. "Okay."</p>
        <p>I waited for her to speak.</p>
        <p>
          She sighed, fingers going through her hair, "Right, okay...um, first
          off. That guy from before was Vitale...Conti. We sort of grew up
          together back in Sicily. Not like grew up—grew up, he was the only
          person close to my age who didn't treat me differently after Martino
          took me. He was the only one I could relate to. I haven't seen him in
          a long time."
        </p>
        <p>"I did not ask about him."</p>
        <p>"No, I—I know you didn't. I was just...telling you."</p>
        <p>When I didn't respond, she swallowed, shifting on her feet again.</p>
        <p>
          "You got it all wrong the other day. I wasn't playing with you,
          messing with you, or trying to ruin your relationship with Devil. I
          was even supposed to talk to him before this, but you—were here so..."
          Her teeth clamped down on her bottom lip as she stumbled on her words,
          "Devil and I kissed, yes, but it didn't mean anything romantic at all.
          I had a—I had a panic attack, and he did it so I would calm down. If
          he hadn't, I wouldn't be here today."
        </p>
        <p>That wasn't a lie.</p>
        <p>
          She squared her shoulders, looking away from me like she didn't like
          any bit of this conversation, "I was...<i>wrong</i>, I made a mistake,
          a temporary lapse in judgment, and...and I'm sorry for putting Devil's
          life in danger, and...and for making you worry." She said, sneaking a
          careful glance at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sincerity in her eyes rocked me to my feet. She was being honest;
          she was apologizing. She was doing all I wanted from the moment I
          started growing interested in her.
        </p>
        <p>To disregard this just or my goal felt...wrong.</p>
        <p>
          When I didn't respond yet again, I could see a twinge of defeat in her
          eyes, but with the breath she let out, I knew she was about to reveal
          more information she had never disclosed to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I've been put to the test before. When I was younger, a year after
          living with Martino." She swallowed. "There was a bomb, and he—he put
          children there in the—in a building. He, um—he asked me to diffuse the
          bomb." She paused, contemplating on if she should continue or not. Her
          hand moved to her cheek to rub off an itch I was sure wasn't there. "I
          thought it was just regular training, until—until I saw the bomb and
          the kids...they were scared, crying. It was, it was terrible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martino was behind me, trying to guide me, but I was too scared. A lot
          was riding on it. If I failed, I would—I would kill them; if I didn't,
          I would save them; I <i>wanted</i> to save them. But—I was too scared,
          too slow, too weak. And the bomb went off. I didn't hear their cries
          anymore but the s—the smell afterward...I couldn't sleep for days, I
          couldn't eat or think, I had nightmares, and Martino he...he didn't
          really care that I wasn't okay."
        </p>
        <p>
          She let out an unsteady breath, looking at me with a strained smile.
          "You want me to be very honest with you, Elio?" she asked, taking two
          steps closer to me until we were just a step away from each other. "I
          am terrified. I am constantly fucking terrified. I put up this strong
          and impenetrable wall around myself; I make it so hard for anyone to
          trust me. I have these issues so fucking deep inside me, this anger
          that makes me a stranger to myself, and I hate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just want the make-believe life with my team. I really
          <i>truly</i> want to leave all this behind me; I want to go where
          nobody knows me, or my name, or the things I've done, but..." she
          gulped down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I might have left Martino, but he never left me. He's here," she
          gestured to her head, "He's in my head, in every fucking action I
          take. I am often reminded that I am who I am today because of him, and
          it messes me up. That man took—he took, he took, and he took so much
          from me, and now I'm just..." she lifted her shoulder, dropped it,
          "empty. Filled with so much hate, so much inferiority, so much
          malice."
        </p>
        <p>
          She was so sincere that her words didn't have to be deciphered before
          it made sense to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You want me to tell you why I always want control, why I never bend?"
        </p>
        <p>I didn't respond.</p>
        <p>
          "It's because I'm not allowed to. I don't have the...luxury of being
          <i>free</i> with my emotions. They've been used against me before, so
          I try as much as possible to stop that from happening again. I protect
          myself and my heart." Her eyes looked into mine. "This thing I'm
          doing, telling you all of this...I don't...I don't do it. I don't want
          to do it, but..." she shrugged with a cautious smile. "You're worth
          it."
        </p>
        <p>My resolve melted, but I didn't speak.</p>
        <p>She sighed. "Just tell me how I can fix this."</p>
        <p>"Why do you want to fix it?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know? Because—I thought asides from us...asides from the
          physical aspect of our relationship, I thought we were friends?"
        </p>
        <p><i>Friends. </i>I didn't want that.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, "I have heard all you've said, I understand the position you
          might have been put in on that bus, and I apologize for the mental
          stress I might have caused afterward, but I still fail to understand
          what you want from me."
        </p>
        <p>
          She blew out a breath like I had been making her work out for hours,
          and then she took the final step closer to me, and I could feel her
          warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You," she stated. "I want you; I want your body, your fucking
          weirdness, just you...all of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          A warm, gentle glow settled inside me, but I locked my jaw as I said,
          "At this point, you're picking out my own words and throwing them back
          at me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, come on, Elio!" she snapped, and it took all my resolve not to
          smile. "I am doing the best I can here; I want to swallow my own
          fucking tongue for even saying all of this shit to you! You're a
          fucking asshole who looks like he wants to kill me half the time, but
          I've known you for months, and you have wanted to kill me for months,
          and you ended up fucking me instead and telling me you like me but
          still want to slit my throat, and here we are!" she breathed out.
          "Here I am, doing the same while trying not to decapitate you for
          making me talk too much."
        </p>
        <p>"Thought you liked talking."</p>
        <p>
          "You know what? Fuck you, and fuck this." she walked around me
          quickly, already opening the door to leave, but I was faster, my back
          pressed to hers, and my hand raised to slam the door shut before she
          could even open it fully.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my palm still pressing on the door, a few spaces above and beside
          her head, and my body still locking hers between me and the door, I
          gave her a tiny space, and she turned around sharply with a murderous
          glare. "If you know what's fucking good for you, you would Let me o—"
        </p>
        <p>I caught her remaining words with my lips.</p>
        <p>
          And it took the warmth from her mouth on mine, the thundering hard
          gripping and tightness in my chest, the nerves compelling feeling up
          my spine to my stomach, and the goosebumps arising on my skin for me
          to realize one mind rocking clarity of what I had just done.
        </p>
        <p>I had broken my last rule. <br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>
          Elio was kissing me, and my limbs, my fight, my last fucking resolve
          had melted with that single buzzing connection. I was standing, but it
          didn't feel like I was standing; my brain cells felt nonexistent, my
          bones were no longer erect, and breathing...<i>what even is that? </i>
        </p>
        <p>Was I breathing before he pressed his lips to mine?</p>
        <p>When was the last time I was conscious? Where the fuck am I?</p>
        <p>
          I felt his hand come to hold the side of my face—gentle— as if he was
          afraid he would break me—and then, he pulled away, and I couldn't see;
          I could breathe air back into my lungs, even with how rapid my heart
          was racing, but for some reason, I couldn't—
        </p>
        <p>Oh, wait.</p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes, catching those intense grey of his stare, now dark
          and filled with so much emotion that had my stomach flipping without
          warning, watching me like I was his most prized possession—like I was
          the reason for his existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might be exaggerating it, but goddamn, if that wasn't the message
          his eyes sent. It was too much for me to handle; it was contagious—too
          contagious that I wanted to push him away and bolt out of this room,
          out of this cruise, out of fucking Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my feet were pinned to the ground, my heart was beating in the
          same rhythm as his, my body was warm all over, and I was a fucking
          goner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If my disgusting behavior with texting him didn't show me how down bad
          I was for this man, this kiss just ripped the veil from my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I vowed never to do that," he said, thumb stroking down my chin to
          the pulsing vein in my neck. "I vowed to never kiss you or anyone ever
          again."
        </p>
        <p>"Why?" I asked my voice barely a whisper upon itself.</p>
        <p>"You didn't like it the first time I did it."</p>
        <p>That was enough to bring a frown to my face. "I never said that—"</p>
        <p>"Your actions afterward spelled it."</p>
        <p>
          Watching him carefully, I brought my hands to his firm chest, feeling
          his heart slam against his chest and then my palm, so fast, so strong,
          so alive. I got on my toes and snaked my arms around his shoulders and
          neck, my eyes searching his. "Did you lose your ability to spell?"
        </p>
        <p>"I don—"</p>
        <p>
          I lifted myself with a small jump, his shoulders supporting my
          movement as my legs went around his waist, and on reflex, his strong
          arms caught me in a secure grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I loved it, Elio," I confessed, my hold tightening around him. "I
          loved it so much it scared the hell out of me."
        </p>
        <p>
          His grip on my hips tightened, "<i>You</i> scare the hell out of me,"
          he whispered against my lips.
        </p>
        <p>"I know," I gulped, "this is not good."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded in agreement, "Is it bad that I want it anyway?" he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered from his eyes to his lips, "No...because I want it
          too,"
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a silent agreement between us that made me feel like I was
          levitating. I wasn't the only one feeling these all-consuming
          emotions; I wasn't the only one confused by it; we were in it
          together, so I joined our lips, and he kissed me back, indulging me by
          parting his lips while my tongue found his—I knew there was no way in
          hell I was denying myself the bliss that seemed to come with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers softly moved into his hair. One of his hands held me
          steady, and the other rubbed up my back to the back of my head, inside
          my hair, keeping me in place as he moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't look, too riled by every zap from places our bodies brushed
          together, but I knew he was carrying us away from the living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without breaking the kiss, he opened a door and closed it, settling me
          on my feet while my hands left him, and he broke away; I was removing
          the costume I wore until I was bare-chested, while he was pulling his
          shirt over his head, and within seconds he was kissing me again, his
          hands exploring, touching, feeling, supplying me a feverish effect I
          never thought my body could produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips left mine to my chin, kissing down my neck as his hands
          helped me out of the thin material of the skirt and chains around my
          waist; while I undid his fly, his need for me prominent against his
          slacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You almost killed me out there," He breathed against my ear, voice a
          fever's whisper away from sounding like he was shivering. "I have
          never felt so many emotions at once; it was exhilarating."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled. "So it wasn't...'good?'" I rephrased his word from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. It was brilliant. I wish you could see how I feel, Zahra," his
          hand fell to my waist and then over my hand on his fly as his eyes
          locked with mine. "Words are too little to describe it."
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was still lost, staring at him, he helped me by zipping down
          and taking off his slacks before following through with his briefs and
          giving me a view of his thick, veiny, erect length. This man was
          perfect in every sense of the word; sexy, charming, dark...I didn't
          know I had a type until him, but would I even consider him a type? He
          was a rarity, one I was lucky enough to have this effect on.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stepped back slowly, watching me like he was trying to soak in the
          view of me, like he was trying to plaster every curve, every scar, and
          every imperfection to his memory.
        </p>
        <p>"Go bare for me," he rasped. "I want to see you."</p>
        <p>
          I would have never done that. Give him control. But I've always had it
          all my life; one night, letting go wouldn't hurt to try.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't take my eyes off him when I took off my underwear, which was
          my last piece of clothing; a chill traveled down my spine as he slowly
          looked at me, from my legs to my thighs to my stomach, my shoulders,
          and my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't lie and say I wasn't vulnerable at this moment. Everything
          was on display for him, every pain I'd received, every memory I had
          held with a tight fist, every fear I'd felt, every slap, every blow,
          every cut, and every burn.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there was no judging in his eyes; nothing changed into a negative
          light; he just looked at me like he always had, but this time, it
          carried a more profound weight, like he was reading me, affirming to
          himself that this body—<i>my</i> body—would be it for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe I was reading wrong or too in over my head, but there was
          nothing unserious about this moment—and scared didn't come close to
          how I felt; terrified was more of the word I would use.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come here," he said softly; I shifted a little on my feet, and the
          moment I started stepping forward and into his reach, his arm curled
          around my waist, pulling me to his body, his cock pressing against my
          stomach as he took a kiss, shutting my airway, stopping my heartbeat,
          igniting my need.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wetness between my legs gave way for the aching thump from my clit
          to torture me; my nipples were hard against his chest, the piercing
          intensifying the painful pleasure; a moan left my mouth when he lifted
          me and carried me to the bed his teeth biting my bottom lip as he laid
          me down, with him atop me, his cock right at my entrance, a little
          teasing brush of him against my slit pulled another moan from my
          throat, and a groan from his.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was driving me crazy, but he was still kissing me, his tongue
          rubbing, lips sucking; he was taking his time, wanting us to taste
          alike. His hand went down to lift my left leg while I took the liberty
          to lift my right, giving him enough room to rub his cock against my
          slit up to my clit—it felt so good my heart was about to burst out of
          my chest. He didn't enter me; it was almost as if he was trying to
          coat his length with my wetness while he kissed me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sucking and licking and rubbing and teasing, building up my
          anticipation, leaving me a wet, needy, and moaning mess; the buildup
          around my clit was criminal, the room was in the average
          temperature—the man wasn't fucking me, but I was sweating, I was
          delirious, not existing as myself, he was owning me now, pushing me to
          the edge but not letting me go.
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips left mine, traveling down my chin to my throat, but he didn't
          stop his hips' movement; the sound of my wetness getting familiar with
          his cock was setting my stomach ablaze. It was dirty, it was intimate,
          and I was feral with a need for him to be inside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I won't tell you you're beautiful," he whispered against my burning
          skin, "I won't tell you you're perfect; you already know that," he
          licked and kissed back up my throat, his eyes, a sexy smokey grey,
          filled with lust and admiration, stared at me. "You already know that
          I know that," he whispered, swallowing, adams apple bopping up and
          down. "What I will tell you, though, is that I see you, and I
          appreciate you sharing this part of yourself with me." he kissed the
          left side of my lips, "I will cherish it," he moved his lips to the
          other side, "Keep it," he kissed my nose, "Adore it," he placed a
          lingering kiss on my lips before breaking it and completing, "And
          worship it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't let me digest his words before he pushed into me with a hard
          thrust that shoved a breath of his name from my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          He kissed me as he pulled out and gave another hard thrust, and my
          hips lifted with it, my back aching at the sensation that traveled
          through every vein in my body, every hair on my skin rising in
          attention. Without seeing myself, I knew I was flush with need, just
          like the man above me, a fucking painting of pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          He fucked me like he was trying to stamp in every word he had just let
          out of his mouth, like he wanted me to believe him. His pace increased
          from hard, slow paces to hard, faster paces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a mess of moans, his name a chanting from my lips, his grunts
          and little deep moans a drive to my ego; I memorized each sound, how
          low his tone was—like he could barely contain himself, like he was on
          a brink.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of his cock pumping into me was my official damnation. I
          would never want anything or anyone else like him or this.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tight build formed in my stomach, and I wanted to drag this out, I
          didn't want to come, but it was apparent he had something different in
          mind because his lips covered a nipple, and his hand went to my clit,
          rubbing at the swollen bud. At the same time, he fucked me at a pace
          that could be considered inhumane—and I was coming, writhing, fucking
          convulsing as the feeling blinded me, took my senses, and threw them
          out into the ocean; the orgasm could have lasted forever because while
          his pace slowed, his hand still worked on my clit, the silver coldness
          of his rings making my thighs quiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          My trembling fingers went around his wrist to stop him from further
          stimulating me, but his other hand removed my hand, intertwining our
          fingers and pinning them to the space above my head.
        </p>
        <p>"You disrespected me," he breathed, slipping out of me.</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Earlier tonight?" his eyes searched mine, "Sitting on another man's
          lap in front of me, letting him touch you..." two ringless fingers
          drove into me in a violent thrust, and my walls clamped tightly around
          them immediately, "In front of me."
        </p>
        <p>"K-Kareem?"</p>
        <p>
          "And Vitale." He whispered against my lips, his fingers thrusting
          harshly in and out of me, sending overwhelming sensations to my nerve
          endings, my toes curled, "Kareem will be spared, but Vitale..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm...fuck," I moaned, clamping my teeth down on my bottom lip, my
          head pressing further into the pillow, back arching from the bed as
          his fingers found my G-spot, and he made sure to hit me there with
          each thrust.
        </p>
        <p>
          His thumb finger flicked my clit in pace with the thrust of his index
          and middle finger, hand squeezing mine against the mattress in a firm
          hold. "I will skin him alive and make it last the exact hour, minute,
          and second that bruise lasts on your arm."
        </p>
        <p>
          He pumped faster, wilder, the sloshing sound of my wetness filling up
          the space between us.
        </p>
        <p>Dirty, so fucking dirty.</p>
        <p>
          My breathing came out in a breathy gasp of moans, my stomach
          clenching, my thighs twitching open and close around his body, which
          he somehow used to maneuver my thighs to remain open, my eyes rolled
          to the back of my head, and I was coming, and coming and coming all
          over his fingers. There was no biting my tongue to stop the short
          scream that left me as the wave took over my body, so suddenly, my
          other hand dug fingers into his shoulder. I was trying to push him off
          and, at the same time, pull him in.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt so good; I didn't want it to stop, his thumb rolled against my
          clit, and my hips twitched in a pleasure shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was coming down from my high when he removed his fingers, pressing
          himself down to whisper in my ear, "I like the way you come undone,
          Querida." He softly kissed my earlobe, "But we're not close to being
          done." He said, and there was a wickedness to his voice that made my
          stomach jump. "You touched Kareem on his chest. In front of me." he
          said, "You danced liked that in front of everyone, strangers and
          acquaintances alike."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That wasn't my fault." I managed out but didn't recognize my own
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know..." he said, raising his body so he could look at me. "You're
          free to enchant people with your charm and aura all you want, but you
          do not do it in front of me."
        </p>
        <p>My lips tilted upwards, "Why? You get jealous?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm," he nodded, brushing the head of his cock on the sensitive flesh
          of my clit; I shivered. "The feeling of jealousy is inconvenient."
        </p>
        <p>"De verdad?"<i> Really?</i></p>
        <p>
          "<i>Si</i>, <i>Zahra</i>," he responded, pronouncing my name with its
          actual traditional intonation. "On your stomach, now."
        </p>
        <p>
          He lifted himself, and though I was fucking done, and my thighs were
          weak and aching, I couldn't do away with the excitement inside me, and
          I also wanted him to experience his existence shatter around him just
          like mine had done a few minutes ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I turned over, brushing my hair back from my face, getting on my
          knees when his hands came around the globes of my ass and up my waist
          as he pushed me down, one of his hands going to the back of my head,
          pushing it down against the pillow, not too hard, but just enough so I
          couldn't move, or look at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart thundered, my body buzzed, and I was anticipating. Waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both his legs came beside my knees as he supported them, relieving me
          of the stress of keeping them up with half my stomach, my whole chest,
          and my head pressed to the bed, and my ass, slightly to the air, back
          arched perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt him behind me, his length between my ass cheeks while his hand
          rubbed up and down my slit, tantalizing me, making me forget that this
          was the first time in a really long time that I was going into this
          position for any man, this was the first time doing this out of my
          free will.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands gripped the sheets as he positioned his cock at my
          entrance—fuck, I wasn't sure I still had another orgasm in me to give,
          but I could feel a dull throbbing in my clit, a tiny flipping in my
          stomach; I was still getting wet, glistening for him, by his effect,
          his grip on my hair, the hotness of his skin on my thighs—when he
          slowly entered me, I pressed my eyes close, a whimper falling from my
          lips as I clenched around him. He was so damn deep inside me, so
          fucking thick and warm, so good; he felt so good I wanted to cry.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand caressed my waist before holding me firm, pulling back a bit
          and thrusting into me again, dragging out another moan and a grunt
          from him. His pace was fast and slow at first, his pelvis slapping
          against my ass, the sound making the pleasure I felt erotically
          painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to come, but I knew I couldn't—I dug my teeth into my lips as
          his pace grew faster, his cock stretching my walls, going deep,
          hitting me where I always came undone, sending waves of pleasure up
          and down my spine, causing a small tear out of my eyes which fought to
          even stay open.
        </p>
        <p>
          His cock was like sugar, too fucking sweet to comprehend. He was too
          much that I couldn't bring myself to complain because I liked it; I
          liked him, I liked the pleasure and the pain that he supplied me, I
          liked the way he handled me and owned me, I liked it too fucking much.
        </p>
        <p>
          His grip tightened on my hair, and my nipples brushed against the
          mattress, a stimulation of its own making.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh fuck, oh fuck..." Words like sobs were leaving my lips, and his
          name was falling from my tongue like water. I was pulsing, my eyes
          filling up, my heart racing as I felt it, another orgasm tightening my
          stomach, driving in a shiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Zahra,"</i> he breathed my name like he was worshipping every
          syllable with a moan. Drawled to show how much he loved being inside
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was falling deeper and deeper as his pace grew harder and faster,
          falling sloppy and shorter. I knew he was close—and after four hard
          thrusts, hot cum coated my walls, triggering another orgasm from me,
          the third one tonight. Even with his support, my thighs gave out, and
          my breathing became gaspy and windy; I was weak everywhere, my bones
          were no longer bones, and sleep clouded my vision as he slipped out of
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt his lips on my neck. He turned me over, his palm running up my
          stomach, past the swell of my breast, and then the side of my face as
          he brought his lips down to mine.
        </p>
        <p>I kissed him back just as softly as he kissed me.</p>
        <p>"You did very good." He said, wiping the sides of my eyes.</p>
        <p>"I think you broke me," I said with a lazy but sated smile.</p>
        <p>His thumb brushed against my bottom lip, "A good kind of break?"</p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>He smiled—or I think he did; sleep was within my reach.</p>
        <p>
          He dropped to my side, but his elbow remained on the bed, propelling
          himself up, fist to the side of his head while his other hand came to
          my stomach; he dragged his knuckles slowly to the side. The softness
          in his touch gave me goosebumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          When his fingers settled on a scar I knew all too well, I shut my
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Who did this?" He asked. "Someone cut you?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, training. Vitale. I was 16, and it hurt like a bitch," I
          chuckled softly, and his fingers trailed to another one; I knew what
          it looked like, a small round scar from a burn; it mainly looked like
          my skin now, but odd.
        </p>
        <p>"What about this?"</p>
        <p>
          "15, the man I was sold to...I didn't really last long as a sex worker
          before I was sold...roughly two years."
        </p>
        <p>"How did it happen?"</p>
        <p>
          I kept my eyes closed. "He always came on some nights—mostly he would
          just want me to blow him; he didn't have sex with me, well—until that
          night...when he was done, he lit a cigarette, asked me to stay there
          while he blew it to my face for some sick reason, and then he pressed
          the lit end on my skin and said it was a mistake, he thought he kept
          the ashtray somewhere close." I said, "I only winced, even though it
          burned."
        </p>
        <p>"And this man, what was his name?"</p>
        <p>
          I managed a shrug. "It doesn't matter," I said. "Martino killed him
          the day I was rescued," I sighed. "It was the first time seeing a
          massacre of that magnitude."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's hand brushed the surface of my skin, "Did Martino cause any of
          these scars?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A sad laugh took over me. "He would never hurt me...at least not
          physically. He's mostly responsible for the emotional and mental scars
          no one can see...well, except you for some weird reason," I opened my
          eyes a little, watching him watch me with a serene gaze. I smiled and
          added, "Some weird supernatural, gut feeling reason,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio raised a brow, going silent but still teasing my skin with his
          fingers; I closed my eyes, relaxing into the feeling as he spoke
          again, voice deep and soft.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you want to know something?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I can't be the only one doing the revealing thing," I said with
          a smile.
        </p>
        <p>"It is not much of a revelation, just an observation."</p>
        <p>"I'm all ears."</p>
        <p>
          "Do you recall when you assumed I had the genes that do not exist? The
          serial killer one?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yup, when you proceeded to say words I've never heard before?"</p>
        <p>"Hm. I figured if there were genes like that, I would have it."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned slightly but didn't open my eyes. "Why do you think that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have peculiar thoughts on occasions where I shouldn't have peculiar
          thoughts. It sometimes shocks me, and sometimes it makes me
          feel...more alive. Sometimes I would have a strong urge to go through
          them, to hurt someone because I like something about... them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes slightly, just enough to see him; his face was still
          relaxed, no frown, no smile, just calm.
        </p>
        <p>"Like a serial killer's victim type?" I asked.</p>
        <p>He nodded.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't know why I asked what I asked next, but I wanted to
          understand what he was saying. "What would be yours?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mostly women," he stated. "With good hair. I feel like they would be
          my target." His gaze met mine and held. He didn't say anything for a
          while, and I didn't say anything too; his hand lifted, and his fingers
          fell into my hair, gently feeling the texture, his voice softening as
          he said, "Does that scare you, Zahra?"
        </p>
        <p>"To be honest, yeah, A little...bit," I answered.</p>
        <p>
          He removed his hand from my hair and swallowed, and I could see that
          he was blocking whatever made him feel like he could reveal that to
          me. "That was not my intention; I won't repeat it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no, it's—it's uh...it's okay; I want to know what goes on in that
          head of yours, even though it's weird—but as long as you haven't—you
          know..."
        </p>
        <p>"Killed a woman because of her hair?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah..."</p>
        <p>
          "No, I haven't. I won't. I will never. It's just that sometimes the
          thought—comes and goes."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Have you ever had that thought with me?"</p>
        <p>
          "No." He said. "I didn't like your hair at first glance. But your
          friend, though—"
        </p>
        <p>"Milk?"</p>
        <p>"Hm. She has beautiful hair."</p>
        <p>
          I didn't know why I laughed. "Noted; I'll ask her to stay away from
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand fell to my stomach again, rubbing with the pad of his fingers
          and grazing with his knuckles. "You do not have to do that; I won't
          hurt her."
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes again, trying to snuggle into him. "I know. I'll hurt
          you first before you think twice about it."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then it went comfortably quiet between us for a few minutes; I was
          already drifting off before he broke the silence.
        </p>
        <p>"Shower?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Hm, no," I mumbled.</p>
        <p>"Hm, yes," He corrected.</p>
        <p>I groaned in protest.</p>
        <p>"Don't worry, I will hold you."</p>
        <p>I gave a weak snort. "I can hold myself,"</p>
        <p>"Oh yeah?"</p>
        <p>
          My heart skipped a beat at how his voice dropped with those two words;
          I raised my head a little and peeked at him to see him hovering, lips
          curled slightly upwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head fell back on the pillow, "Fuck me, you really are something,
          Elio."
        </p>
        <p>"Come on,"</p>
        <p>
          But my eyes were already closing; even as I got lifted from the bed a
          moment later and he took us to the bathroom, I still held on to
          him...I felt so fucking sore, and I wasn't sure my legs were ready to
          start working again.
        </p>
        <p>
          All through the process of cleaning up, with him making me brush my
          teeth and dry my hair, I was in a half-dazed state. When I was back on
          the bed, with fresh clothes that were sizes too big for me and smelt
          like him, I felt like heaven was within my reach; I snuggled into the
          pillow with a contented smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          He joined me without a shirt on, just sweatpants. He didn't make a
          move to lie down entirely. It was as if he wasn't planning on
          sleeping,
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm just gonna..." I started with a mumble. "I'm just gonna sleep for
          like...two hours...and then...I'll go...no spending...night."
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand brushed my hair from my face, his warm knuckles brushing my
          cheek, "Want me to wake you?" he asked softly.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah...sure."</p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          His 'okay' sounded so far away...very far into a dark, echoing
          place...and I was out in seconds.
        </p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>LOUIS ARMSTRONG </b>was singing 'What a wonderful world' when I
          opened my eyes, yawned, and stretched my hands above my head, my legs
          taking that cue to stretch too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blinking my vision clear, my hand went under the white duvet and
          underneath the white shirt I wore; as I rubbed my stomach and looked
          to the side at the open window. I caught the bright day, the clear and
          blue waters, and the sky brightened by the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, looking away and above me. I stared for a full minute
          before looking around at the empty room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sounds of the music echoing from the walls, relaxing jazz, dreamy
          and soft—it made my thinking slow, gave the atmosphere a smooth edge
          that had me feeling like I was in the first scene of a mystery
          thriller, and I was that character who opened the film by dying.
        </p>
        <p>The first meaningless victim.</p>
        <p>
          Goosebumps traveled up my skin as I looked at the other side of the
          bed. Clearly, I was the only one who had slept here last night. Elio
          had probably stayed till I was deep in sleep and then left.
        </p>
        <p>I looked out the window again.</p>
        <p>"Shit." I sat up.</p>
        <p><i>He didn't wake me.</i></p>
        <p>
          I threw the covers off myself and got off his bed and out the room,
          rubbing my eyes as another yawn left me, the music growing less
          muffled when I reached the living area, stopping short after I spotted
          Elio by the bar area, sat on a bar stool, the side of his head leaning
          on his fist, while he stared blankly at the half-filled whisky glass
          he held.
        </p>
        <p>
          His shoulders were slumped in a move that showed tiredness. He didn't
          sleep all through the night. Obviously, and he didn't take anything to
          help him either.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppressed a sigh and then started walking over toward him. He
          didn't look my way once; even when I reached his line of vision, his
          eyes didn't leave the glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey." I greeted, seeing the slight dark circles underneath his eyes
          and a white bandage around his knuckles like he had sustained some
          injury
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He responded, still not looking at me. Body here, mind
          elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>"You didn't wake me like I asked."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          I stared at him for a bit, my head still asleep, between my legs still
          sore from last night's...activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right," I said with a firm nod. "I need coffee to deal with this," I
          gestured to him. "Whatever this is. Where's the kitchen—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Left." He cut me off, still not looking at me. It was like he wanted
          me out of sight so he could stare peacefully at the whiskey glass.
        </p>
        <p>"Why are—"</p>
        <p>
          A knock on the door cut me off as my gaze moved to its closed frame.
          "You expecting someone?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised his head and then glanced at the door before responding.
          "No."
        </p>
        <p>The knock came in again. "You're not gonna answer it?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          He looked away from the door and then at me before his gaze moved to
          the door and back to me again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Answer it," he said, pressing a button on a small remote beside him,
          stopping the music.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "Do I look like your fucking butler?"</p>
        <p>
          "With your hair like that, you wouldn't pass as room service, so, No,
          you do not look like my butler."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gave him the middle finger with a sweet smile before walking past
          him towards the door and swinging it open with one hand while the
          other pushed my hair back from my face.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned at the stranger I locked eyes with.</p>
        <p>
          A frown had her brows dropping as she looked at me, too; bright blue
          eyes shone with confusion.
        </p>
        <p>"May I help you?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Uh..." her gaze darted to a space behind me, her eyes widening a bit
          in question, and I snapped my head back to see Elio watching, face
          pointedly expressionless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back at the blonde girl, I shifted to block her view of him,
          giving her a pointed stare. "Yes?" I pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was...uncomfortably pretty. There was a shine to her that made me
          want to frown. Barely clothed, she had a bright blue short, unbuttoned
          and unzipped, showcasing her bright blue bikini thong, which matched
          the bra that barely covered the swell of her breast. Her blonde hair
          was pushed up in a ponytail, curly strands falling around her face
          like she woke up with the word perfect tattooed to her aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Um...I'm sorry?" She squeaked out. "I think I got the wrong door; I
          was—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wrong door?" I stated, confused. "You're just allowed to wander into
          a platinum axis reserved for private use, and you got the wrong door?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked at me, but my frown didn't let up. "Um...well, I—I
          have—uh—uh, Topographical disorientation." she stopped, probably
          seeing the confusion in my eyes. "I have directional issues; it would
          shock you how many times I end up somewhere that I—you know, didn't
          initially want to go?—I—I don't even know why the guards at the front
          didn't stop me—um...dumbblondemoment?" she rushed out the last three
          words, supplying me a half-assed laugh, and taking a step back while I
          squinted at her. "I will leave you now, and um—go...go find the right
          door."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then she bolted out of sight. I tilted my head while I closed the
          door slowly before turning to regard Elio, who was finishing the last
          of his whiskey, completely unbothered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was weird?" I voiced. "Is there really such a thing as
          toro-whatever she said?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced my way for a brief moment before going to pour himself
          another round, ignoring me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to acknowledge that or the girl with a screwed-up
          direction sense, I made my way to the direction he had gestured to,
          another yawn leaving me as I padded barefooted into the large kitchen,
          grabbing a mug without really looking around and then proceeded to the
          coffee—
        </p>
        <p>
          My soul left my body alongside the scream that escaped my throat. It
          was so loud as I jumped and kicked something warm and soft that had
          brushed my feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a glance for me to catch the black furry animal by the side,
          very still with a low warning growl, its fur standing erect all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          My instinct told me to remain in place, but my legs were already
          working ahead of me; I bolted right out of the kitchen and the
          creature, hot on my tail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I was still screaming, still in flight mode, as I spotted Elio
          on his feet, approaching with a frown on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What happened—" He didn't complete that statement because I was on
          him the next instant, my hands falling around his shoulder, my legs
          around his waist, inching up as he stumbled back with the impact of me
          jumping on him.
        </p>
        <p>His arms came around me protectively.</p>
        <p>
          "There's a fucking cat, a fucking panther, I don't fucking know, but
          its—"
        </p>
        <p>"Stopped."</p>
        <p>
          My heartbeat ran five paces per second as I turned my head slowly
          backward for a second to see the cat standing still in front of us,
          swollen with anger, it was too still, bright eyes watching, waiting
          for a movement, an excuse to attach, to chase, and I was breaking out
          sweat even though I had climbed up him in panic.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Relax," he gently rubbed my back. "Your heart is beating so fast. Are
          you really that scared?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away, dropping my head on his shoulder. "No—I mean—yes b-but
          just, don't fucking let go of me."
        </p>
        <p>"I will have to let go eventually—"</p>
        <p>
          I tightened my hold around him, knowing if it were possible, I would
          climb up his head just to—His grip loosened, and he moved to drop me
          down; the deep purring sound grew a little louder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I gripped his shirt, tightening my legs around his waist, refusing to
          let go. "Please, please, please don't let me go, I beg you."
        </p>
        <p>"You'll be fine."</p>
        <p>
          "No, no, no, <i>fuck</i> no, I swear to God, Elio, if you let me go, I
          will stab you until I ruin a vital fucking tissue; I am not bluffing."
        </p>
        <p>
          He chuckled, bringing his lips to my ear, "This is a surprise." He
          said, his tone low.
        </p>
        <p>"How do we get rid of it—"</p>
        <p>"You can't; She lives here, for now."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned, scared even to move. "What the fuck? You have a fucking
          cat? Why do you have a fucking cat?"
        </p>
        <p>"She is not mine; that is Mimi. She's Angelos'"</p>
        <p>
          My grip still tightened around him. "I don't give a fuck who her owner
          is; I just need her to stop looking at me like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hold on," Amusement laced his voice, "you can shoot people in the
          face, enchant a whole room filled with strangers, make me a subject to
          you, stop a bomb on a moving school bus, and the thing that scares
          you, is a... cat?"
        </p>
        <p>I gritted my teeth. "Gloat all you want; just don't drop me."</p>
        <p>
          He patted my back reassuringly. "I am not gloating; I am just
          surprised. You keep surprising me at every turn."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Glad I serve as your constant element of surprise, but that cat is
          not backing down from wanting to attack me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio shifted slightly. "We just need to distract her, that's all."
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed. "How do you suppose we—"</p>
        <p>
          He made a cat call sound, and something furry came running out of the
          kitchen store room, ginger and huge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I inched further up into his hold. "Oh my God, there's another one.
          There's another one."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't see him, but I could hear the smile in his voice. "They are
          harmless, Sport."
        </p>
        <p>"It chased me."</p>
        <p>"That's because you ran from her, screamed, and scared her."</p>
        <p>
          Elio stepped to the side, his hold still strong around me. I watched
          as the ginger cat came behind the black one, watching us too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, the black cat—Mimi, had stopped growling, but it still
          watched us as Elio moved towards the kitchen until we were completely
          out of sight of both cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          I released the breath I had been holding, willing the pace of my heart
          to be calm.
        </p>
        <p>"Am I free to let you go now?" Elio asked.</p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, releasing my hold on him as I managed a slight
          nod, unable to meet his gaze when he settled me atop the kitchen
          counter, his focus entirely on my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing my lips together, I succumbed and looked at him because I
          wanted to get the shame over with once and for all. "What? You don't
          have your own embarrassing fears?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "If I have an embarrassing fear, I am yet to be acquainted with it."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, whatever. I'm only human."</p>
        <p>"A human who fears cats."</p>
        <p>
          "So does a lot of people in the fucking world, get over it. And it's
          not like I fear, <i>fear</i>them. It's just—they're too soft, and
          there's just something about their eyes and—and how they just look at
          you like they can see your fucking soul. This one just scared me;
          that's why I ran. Otherwise, I just stay clear, even if I'm in the
          same environment as them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio nodded, "Good to know. I will take note of that." He said.
          "Although, I must admit, seeing you in that state was amusing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know you get pleasure from my suffering; that's a non-spoken fact."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "Yes. I do derive pleasure from your suffering." He
          accepted with a serious expression. "But this particular action of
          yours was pretty entertaining and cute. I never thought I would
          associate you with that word."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him and opened my mouth to give a comeback, but nothing
          came out, so I just sat there and squirmed.
        </p>
        <p>"You said you wanted coffee?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Yeah, I did, but this little incident has done the job."</p>
        <p>"I see." He stated. "Would you still like me to make you one?"</p>
        <p>
          I raised a brow at him and laughed, "You know how to make coffee?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes," he didn't appreciate my underestimation. "I do."</p>
        <p>"Okay...sure, go ahead."</p>
        <p>
          He turned to the coffee maker, and I saw the ginger cat approach,
          leaning against the wall while it leaked its fur.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is there any other animal you do not like?" Elio asked as he worked
          his way with the coffee machine,
        </p>
        <p>"No...I don't know; I haven't seen a lot."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          "What about you?" I asked, watching his back muscles work as he fixed
          my mug under the coffee maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I haven't seen a lot too. But I suppose I would neither like nor hate
          them if I saw them. It is always neutral with me."
        </p>
        <p>"Everything is neutral with you."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          There was silence after that, just the sound of the machine working;
          he glanced my way at some point, asking me how I preferred to have my
          coffee. When I supplied him with the answer, he turned back to
          continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he was done and dropped the mug beside me, he leaned on the oven
          opposite the counter, watching me as I took a sip.
        </p>
        <p>It was...good. Not as great as Upper's, but perfect.</p>
        <p>"Is it okay?"</p>
        <p>I gave him a thumbs-up as I drank while he watched me.</p>
        <p>
          Feeling calm from the shock of the earlier event, I dropped the almost
          empty mug by my side and decided to break the silence and understand
          why he didn't take his eyes off me, not even once.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were calculating, assessing, like he wanted to broach a topic,
          but he wasn't sure how to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>"So...why didn't you wake me?"</p>
        <p>
          "I was about to, but then I entered the room and saw you were sleeping
          soundly; I didn't want to wake you. Sleep is vital."
        </p>
        <p>"Says the guy who didn't get any."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. You know why I can't go to sleep. I want to, I get tired and
          sleepy, but then I try to sleep, and it doesn't come. It's too loud in
          my head some nights."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed. "I thought you had pills that you took?"</p>
        <p>"I wasn't in the right mind to take them."</p>
        <p>My gaze fell on his bandaged hand. "How'd you get that?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at it and managed to take it away from my view. "An
          accident." He supplied.
        </p>
        <p>"An accident from..."</p>
        <p>
          "An accident." He repeated, straightening suddenly as he walked
          towards me, his hands separating my thighs, and he stepped between my
          legs, placing hands on either side of me. I sucked in a breath at his
          sudden proximity. "I want to discuss something with you," he said,
          eyes searching mine.
        </p>
        <p>My throat went dry. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "I assume you are well aware that I am very straightforward, and I do
          not like being unclear with something this important to me."
        </p>
        <p>I felt a brick in my guard come up. "Yeah?"</p>
        <p>
          "Good." He stated, ignoring the way my voice had sounded. "I have
          never been with any woman intimately more than once. You are aware
          that you're an exception, Yes?"
        </p>
        <p>"Uh...I mean, it's not a—it's not a big deal."</p>
        <p>
          He frowned slightly. "It is. I have broken my rules and laws for you,
          I have gone back on my word, I have changed plans for you."
        </p>
        <p>I shrugged, "The pussy is good, you gotta admit."</p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>"Fine. I'm listening."</p>
        <p>
          "As I said, I do not like being unclear with something this important
          to me." his throat worked, and his eyes fell to my mouth for a brief
          moment before looking back at me again.
        </p>
        <p>My chest constricted.</p>
        <p>"I would like to start a relationship with you," he stated.</p>
        <p>
          My lips parted, jaw hanging—I knew it was coming, I knew the kind of
          person he was, but I didn't...ah fuck...this isn't going to be pretty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You want..." I trailed off a bit, discomfort turning my stomach.
          "To...to date me..." I stated before adding, "Me." for clarification.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "Wh—" I stopped, breathing became a bit...not so flowy as I tried to
          grasp how the conversation had gone from manageable to this. "Elio—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "This affair won't continue if there is no title to tie it by, Zahra.
          I do not do affairs and secret rendezvous."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I don't do relationships; I have never done relationships, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>"So have I. It would be a first for me too."</p>
        <p>
          "Why would you want a relationship with me—what would you gain from
          it? I don't understand why you would—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I like you, ve—a lot. And just yesterday, you said you
          returned my feelings, so...two people with a connection like ours can
          either grow or dismiss it. I'm asking to grow it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him for a moment, sighed, and shook my head. "I—This is—I'm
          not—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "All I want is to title what we're already doing; I am not asking for
          something new or something we're not already doing, in case you
          misinterpreted."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know what you're talking about; it's just—I can't—there's no easy
          to put it—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Something dimmed in his eyes as he pulled back slightly from me.
          "You're rejecting me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No...I mean yes...I mean, I don't—I am not into labels and commitment
          and all of that serious shit."
        </p>
        <p>
          He drew away from me ultimately. "So you planned to be with other
          people while with me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I got down from the counter, "That's not—" I swallowed. "I don't
          know."
        </p>
        <p>He frowned in disappointment. "You don't...know."</p>
        <p>I was saying all the wrong fucking things.</p>
        <p>
          "Elio, this is sudden, okay? I know you don't do unlabeled things, but
          I've done unlabeled things all my life, and I can't—I don't know yet
          what I would be getting into if I said yes."
        </p>
        <p>There was silence after that.</p>
        <p>
          He nodded slowly. "What you would be getting into," he repeated under
          his breath as if he was digesting my words. I could see the gears
          turning in his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Okay, so yes, I am not saying all the right things at the
          moment; you caught me off guard; I need—I need time to think—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand if you want to reject my proposal." He stated. "It is
          probably for the best that you reject it. That was forward of me."
        </p>
        <p>"No, it wasn't. I need to think it over a little."</p>
        <p>
          "The last thing I want to do is discomfort you, which I seem to have
          done. We should stop while we're not that ahead."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, are you even listening to a word I'm saying? Give me time to
          talk to a third party, to talk to Devil, and think some more. I need
          space with my own head. I already clarified that I wanted this, and I
          won't let a label thing ruin it. I just need to understand it. That's
          all."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>"Don't fucking 'hm' me right now. Communicate with actual words."</p>
        <p>"I don't know what to say." He responded.</p>
        <p>
          He had told me on that rooftop how all his meaningless encounters had
          only lasted that one time it happened. I knew somewhere at the back of
          my mind that I wasn't a meaningless encounter; he showed me that last
          night—hell, he's been showing me in a lot of ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had known this man for months, hated and was irritated by him half
          the time; even now, he still irritated me a bit, and he was not above
          a straight punch to the nose if he misbehaved, but—the only difference
          between then and now was that I understood the way that brain of his
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, he was probably thinking he should have left things the way
          they were, but then again, even if he had left things the way they
          were, I already knew—he had told me when we were high out of our minds
          on that rooftop, how much he respects women, and the reasons why he
          had never been with them more than once.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was an exception, and I knew him wanting to make things extra
          serious was a given, but I didn't think it would feel so overwhelming,
          so scary to the point that I wouldn't know what to do or say to avoid
          hurting his feelings or make him think I didn't care enough, I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't just the sex. But I needed time. At least to talk to Devil,
          clear things up, and tell him all that had been going on. Hell—I'd
          suffice for telling all of STREET if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I should go," I said. "I'll come by later after I think it through.
          You should try to get some rest."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          I offered a tight smile, about to sidestep him when I saw the two cats
          just by the entrance, watching us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at him. "On a second note....would you mind walking me
          back to your room to change into my own clothes and then to the door?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the cats and then at me. No expression. No amusement.
          Just blank. Thoughts, unable to be read as he responded again.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>He wasn't angry. He was just...upset. I could salvage upset.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "Where the bloody hell have <i>you</i> been?" Upper asked as I walked
          in, a coffee cup in his hand, voice groggy, eyes dark from lack of
          sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why do you look like you didn't get any sleep?" I asked, closing the
          suite door. He was wearing an oversized sky-blue hoodie with sweat
          pants, hair all angles of messed up, nose a different shade of red.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I fell overboard, drank too much, got a mini fever all through the
          night, almost puked my intestines out, and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Made out with a <i>girl.</i>" Dog said with a smug smile, appearing
          from the corner as he grabbed another cup of coffee in the coffee
          holder.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What?" I asked as Milk walked out of her room, wearing a bathing suit
          and sending a wave my way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was nothing," Upper sent a glare Dog's way, but Dog didn't see it
          because his eyes were on Milk, who looked like she was getting ready
          to head out. "The girl wanted to make her boyfriend jealous; she
          walked up to me and asked me to kiss her; I told her I was gay, and
          she said, even better, and then she was sucking my face."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh..."</p>
        <p>
          "And where are you off to?" Dog asked Milk with a frown as he leaned
          on a wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was tying her hair up in a ponytail as she glanced his way with a
          grin. "While you guys were whoring away, I got invited to a pool party
          by some cool guys I met last night." She spoke. "They own a gold
          suite, and it is <i>incredible</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog's frown deepened. "So...you're just gonna fuck off to a strangers
          space because, 'oh hey, they think I'm pretty, and they're pretty too,
          why not go to the pool party hosted by people I don't know because I
          have great tits and I also think they're cool.'"
        </p>
        <p>Milk's brows shot up. "You think I have great tits?"</p>
        <p>"Somebody, shoot me." Dog said with an exasperated sigh.</p>
        <p>
          Milk snickered as Devil came out of his room, freshly showered,
          looking more responsible than anyone else. "Z," he said with a frown,
          eying me from head to toe. "Where the hell have you been?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew out a breath, now or never. "Okay, before Milk leaves for the
          cool people's party, can we all gather for a mini briefing?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's brows furrowed in confusion, and I knew she was curious about
          what this briefing meant. She would have told them the mission had
          succeeded, and Kareem had called me to join his table.
        </p>
        <p>
          They settled around the lounge area, Milk and Upper on a bean bag,
          Devil on the arm of the couch Dog had taken. I stood before them like
          I was about to give a speech. "As far as yesterday went, I think we
          already got that invite from Kareem. We talked, and he invited me and
          anyone I wanted to bring to events here and outside the cruise...so we
          can score ourselves a private tour to the Arturo manor with a little
          talking."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," Upper said. "Milk told us how you fucked everyone without
          fucking them."
        </p>
        <p>I glanced at Milk, who shrugged.</p>
        <p>
          "That's a...really odd way of putting it, but yes, the dance was a
          success. It got us what we wanted, at least...it got us to the right
          path to what we want."
        </p>
        <p>"That's a good thing, yeah?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes...except, we're not the only ones after Kareem's attention."</p>
        <p>
          "There's always a bloody obstacle," Upper complained. "Can't we just
          break into the manor, a clean sweep?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We already registered that would come with a 20% success. It is
          heavily guarded with several civilians that could be caught in a
          crossfire, and our best way, is through a tour, under disguise." I
          told him.
        </p>
        <p>"So, who's the fucking obstacle?" Dog asked</p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat. "Marino's people. They know about the manor.
          Also, Elio was seated right next to Kareem, and they seemed to be
          close, so, yeah, we have big competition."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right." Devil nodded, a confused look in his eyes. "That doesn't
          answer the question about where you were; we were worried. Did you go
          with Kareem?" Devil asked with a frown. "You know you didn't have to—"
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head. "No...I uh...I didn't go with Kareem."</p>
        <p>Milk's eyes widened in realization.</p>
        <p>Dog's gaze narrowed on me.</p>
        <p>Upper raised his brow.</p>
        <p>Devil was confused.</p>
        <p>
          I blew out a sharp breath, bracing myself as I blurted. "I went with
          Elio."
        </p>
        <p>The silence after I said that was palpable.</p>
        <p>Upper's coffee cup stopped midway to his lips.</p>
        <p>Milk's lips formed an 'o'</p>
        <p>Dog's eyes widened as he whistled.</p>
        <p>Devil...was confused.</p>
        <p>"I beg your pardon?" He asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I was with Elio; I spent a night in his suite. Not that it's any of
          you guys' business, I just wanted to let you know that I might be
          sleeping with the enemy, but it doesn't mean I am compromised."
        </p>
        <p>Milk shook her head slowly.</p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ," Dog breathed out.</p>
        <p>"I knew it...back in Turin. The matching outfits." Upper stated.</p>
        <p>I blinked. "That was pure coincidence, but yeah."</p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck?" Devil voiced, his face scrunched in confusion and
          disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "I didn't see the need to tell any of you because it wasn't
          serious then, but now—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you fucking serious, Z?" he snapped, cutting me off. I could feel
          the anger vibrating off of him. "My brother?"
        </p>
        <p>"Devil—"</p>
        <p>
          He shot to his feet, rushing towards the door as he gritted. "I'm
          gonna fucking kill him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before he could pull the door open, I rushed past him to stand between
          him and the door frame, "Devil—"
        </p>
        <p>"Get out of my way."</p>
        <p>"Give me a minute to explain."</p>
        <p>
          "Explain what." He fumed. "He always manages to fucking step on my
          toes; now he's done it with you? And you—"
        </p>
        <p>"He didn't do anything I didn't want, Devil."</p>
        <p>
          That made him stop, his eyes searching mine, "What?" he breathed out
          the question.
        </p>
        <p>"Let's talk in my room, okay?"</p>
        <p>"Z—"</p>
        <p>"I promise I'll explain everything."</p>
        <p>
          When he didn't respond, I cautiously took his wrist and led him
          towards my bedroom, shooting the rest of STREET an apologetic tight
          smile before we disappeared behind the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would deal with Dog and Upper later; Devil was the priority right
          now.
        </p>
        <p>He removed his wrist from my hold, watching me with apprehension.</p>
        <p>
          "I didn't know it would get serious between Elio and me...it was just
          supposed to be a one-time thing—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You promised you would stay away from him. You fucking promised me."
        </p>
        <p>"I know."</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, "No, you don't." he said. "You don't fucking know.
          He could hurt you, Z."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know...but I also know he wouldn't...you know that too, but for
          some reason, you're choosing to hate him and blame him for something
          he's not completely at fault for. I started it. He was very reluctant
          because of you—"
        </p>
        <p>"Apparently, that didn't last."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Where exactly is your anger coming from? Is this because
          you don't like him or because you love me—which can't be the case
          since Upper? —I need to understand you."
        </p>
        <p>
          He went silent, confusion in his eyes as he heaved a breath and looked
          up like he was trying to find the answer to my question.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a while, he walked past me to sit at the edge of the bed, his
          hands brushing down his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the space beside him, angling my body towards his. "I didn't do
          it on purpose. I wanted to stay away; I did. I just couldn't." I told
          him. "You and I are not together like that anymore, and fuck it, if I
          were to be a bitch, I would point out the fact that you fucked around
          with Upper when we were together."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me with a confused frown. "You <i>literally</i> just
          pointed it out."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, well...maybe I am a bitch."</p>
        <p>
          He scoffed, looking away from me while shaking his head. "I don't
          know, Zahra, this is just so fucking weird. I mean, Elio?" he looked
          at me again, "How did it start?"
        </p>
        <p>"Do you really wanna know?"</p>
        <p>
          He blinked. "No. No, please don't tell me. I just—what did you mean by
          serious? What exactly is going on?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Half the time, I don't know what's going on. It just happened, and I
          was too deep before I could back away. But I promise he didn't hold a
          gun to my head and force me to like him or something. It's mutual,
          actually."
        </p>
        <p>"You like him?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah..."</p>
        <p>
          "But you're not the kind to do commitment. And Elio, if I remember
          correctly, he doesn't do your kind."
        </p>
        <p>"No, he doesn't."</p>
        <p>
          "So..." he trailed off, shaking his head, "I can't believe we're
          having this conversation now. It's unbelievable."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Trust me; I feel the whiplash every day," I spoke. "It's kind of like
          you said with Upper, how you felt whenever you saw him; it's kind of
          the same way I feel...not that intense but it's there nonetheless."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive him for what he did to
          you. How can you like someone like that? He's not a—he's a lost cause,
          Zahra. You ought to know that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't say shit like that, D; he broke things off with me because of
          you; he cares about you more than anything in this fucking world; I
          know you have your differences, but if you would just talk to him for
          a change—"
        </p>
        <p>"You're fucking brainwashed," he said.</p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "So that's it, you've given up on him because he tried to
          drown me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not just that. He's hurt you on multiple occasions, he—can't you see
          that this is some part of his fucking play? How can he just turn a one
          fucking eighty from wanting to kill you to fucking you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It wasn't one-eighty. There's a lot you don't know about us or how
          this started. I only told you guys because it's not something I want
          to hide and because I respect you as my best friend. I don't need your
          approval to be with who I want to be with."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know you don't need my approval. But he's my brother. He's not a
          good person for you. He might be all niceties now, but once you fuck
          up, there will be a bullet in your head. He's just like his fucking
          father."
        </p>
        <p>Exasperated, I sighed. "Devil...I think you should talk to him."</p>
        <p>His eyes searched mine. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "I think you should talk to Elio. You blame him for a lot, and you're
          wrong about literally everything. The longer you two keep walking on
          eggshells around each other, the longer you continue to hurt each
          other unnecessarily."
        </p>
        <p>
          The look in his eyes could define reluctance and confusion. "I don't
          understand."
        </p>
        <p>
          I leveled him with a stare. "Remove me from the equation, remove my
          relationship with him...remove the fact that you're angry at him for
          hurting me all those times. And focus on your actual relationship with
          him. Focus on how you felt before he tried to drown me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away with a tight frown, his jaw clenching and unclenching.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't hate him, Devil. You're just angry at him. You're angry
          that you pushed him away, and he didn't try to fix it. You think he
          doesn't care because he never shows it, and just like him, you left it
          that way; you're stubborn, he's stubborn, but at some point, one of
          you has to be the bigger person." I said and then added. "Personally,
          I think you should be the bigger person; then you get bragging
          rights."
        </p>
        <p>
          His head dropped in a small laugh, and then he looked at me. "Why are
          you like this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I will always root for you, D. I might like him, but you
          still come first to me."
        </p>
        <p>"Really?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, really—really, as in if a house was on fire and the two of you
          were stuck there, and I could only save one person, it would be you,
          no questions asked."
        </p>
        <p>"And you're certain his intentions with you are genuine?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"What about yours?"</p>
        <p>My stomach dipped. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Your intentions. I know there's always something up your sleeves," he
          watched me. "I'm trying to make sure this is not one of them because
          if it is and you hurt—"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't have ill intentions."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes watched, brows furrowed, stare intense, and just like that,
          it felt like I was staring at Elio; this very moment took me to the
          times when it felt like Elio was trying to look into my soul to fish
          out a lie in my truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          After he found what he was looking for, he nodded. "I don't know if—if
          I'll stop finding it weird...ever, you'll have to give me time, Z.
          This is not what I thought I would hear today."
        </p>
        <p>"Of course," I swallowed, "Will you talk to him, though?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know. I—I need time to think. To digest this."</p>
        <p>
          And I nodded, watching him rake his fingers through his hair,
          wondering what was going through his head, what kind of assurance he
          had seen in my eyes...
        </p>
        <p>
          While somewhere at the back of my mind, I was fighting a battle with
          myself. Confirming all of this and telling STREET of my involvement
          with Elio meant I had accepted his proposal to give us a fucked
          up—very unnecessary label—mentally.
        </p>
        <p>And I shouldn't...</p>
        <p>I really fucking shouldn't.</p>
        <p>
          Whilst not having ill intentions with him, there was no way I wouldn't
          end up hurting him at the end of the day. I shouldn't be selfish; I
          shouldn't eat my cake and fucking have it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I had never been known to be selfless when it came to something I
          really wanted.
        </p>
        <p><i>So...selfish it is. </i></p>

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>I STARTED </b>seeing my mother 13 hours ago.</p>
        <p>
          At first, I was aghast. She was so real, indubitably present. She
          carried along the feeling of being in an environment with another
          person. When she looked up at me from her position on the couch, my
          world stopped, rotated, and stood in place. The black dress she wore
          was the same one I had seen in that video footage before she had
          bathed herself in petrol and set the whole church on fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had closed my eyes for about five minutes, standing utterly still.
          When I opened them again, she was gone.
        </p>
        <p>That was the first time I had ever seen her.</p>
        <p>
          That was the second time I realized I was no longer in control of my
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the thousandth time I had told myself I shouldn't be here. I
          should hurry up. Finish this once and for all. Stop wasting time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was conjointly at that moment, and that single thought, that I
          realized I wasn't as focused on that idea as I once was. It was the
          first time I indeed acknowledged that I was stalling, not because I
          hadn't finished what I wanted to do, but because I thought I had a lot
          to look forward to. To anticipate. I thought there was enough reason
          to want to live, to change my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the entire night after being with Zahra, battling with my own
          mind, mumbling pros and cons that refused to keep themselves inside my
          mind, slamming my fist into a mirror because I hated what my
          reflection showed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A confused man. Unfocused nonsense. An indecisive entity. A man who
          couldn't even do what he truly wanted. A man who couldn't end the life
          he had craved to end since he watched his family burn. A man who hated
          himself because he had these thoughts, this weakness, eating at him
          from the inside out. A self-inflicted parasite. Abnormal. Wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          My depression had arrived with a vengeance after seeing the woman who
          birthed me.
        </p>
        <p>I needed to sleep.</p>
        <p>
          Four days of sleepless nights was not something I let fester. But four
          days of sleepless nights with depression and hallucinations? I knew I
          needed a total knockout—a shutdown, something that would take me out
          for days on end. But I couldn't do that—I didn't trust myself enough
          to proceed with it, so wearing myself out was the most appealing
          option.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought out alcohol. Cigars didn't wear me out; they made me active.
        </p>
        <p>So I drank, put on feel-good music, and waited.</p>
        <p>
          That was until Zahra had woken up, and I had tried my best to block
          out her presence because I could already feel my body relaxing into
          the atmosphere, the alcohol, and the music.
        </p>
        <p>But I should have known better.</p>
        <p>
          Her scream from the kitchen had taken away my hours of progress to
          find solace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly I was more in tune with my environment; the alcohol stopped
          making me tired; it made me active.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interruption, though, didn't irritate me. It surprised me. I was
          amused. My mood was lifted, and for those moments, holding her close
          to me while she asked me not to let her go, I forgot exactly why I
          couldn't sleep, why I was depressed. It felt good, <i>she</i> felt
          good, and I felt the instant regret of not wrapping my arms around her
          after she slept, of not tapping from that peace that seemed to make
          her body sink into the bed in sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to. I really did. But I also didn't want to overstep my
          boundaries; she once said she was opposed to...cuddling.
        </p>
        <p>
          And before I had taken a dive for the worst, I had been thinking of
          ways to change that opposition, to make the idea more acceptable to
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking her to be in a relationship became the best solution. But
          seeing the way that action had brought forth a negative response, how
          uncomfortable she had been with the mere thought of committing to me—I
          felt angry—wanted to tell her she had no choice because she had made
          me fall for her, she had made me question everything I wanted for
          myself, the least she could do was indulge me, and not dismiss me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, I saw how she fought for words, how her eyes had shined in
          discomfort and horror like being with me that way was as atrocious as
          signing a death sentence. I realized I had been too forward. I didn't
          think it through; of course, she wouldn't want that.
        </p>
        <p>Who in their right mind would want that?</p>
        <p>
          After she had left, I continued my drinking and put on some music
          again—I turned it off an hour later when my head started to pound—and
          I stopped drinking soon after when my stomach started to reject it. I
          felt the alcohol trying to come back out of my throat, and suddenly
          the room became too cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reduced the temperature of the air conditioner, turned on the
          heater, and then realized I didn't reasonably need the heat because my
          skin began to burn.
        </p>
        <p>I was hot, cold, and uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>The pounding in my head was worse than before.</p>
        <p>
          I felt like I could sleep now, but I couldn't help the discomfort I
          felt; despite me having to have turned the temperature in the room
          into something bearable, I was still so cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to have another warm shower—after I did, I opted to find
          something heavy to ward off the cold—a thick black hoodie sweater with
          thick sweatpants.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dried my hair thoroughly because the wet strands irritated my eyes
          and neck, a clear sign that it was due for another cut.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind drew a blank line when I tried to remember the last time I cut
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I was all done, I settled on the bed, but with a tiny sniff of
          the pillow, my mind took me back to last night—to Zahra, who had
          rejected me and was now waiting to think about it so she could twist
          the knife further in by rejecting me again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my nose into the pillow and breathed in like the creep she
          had once referred to me as.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lay there for minutes and then grew uncomfortable with the view of
          the vast ocean; the pillow became as hot as my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat up with a groan, my hand falling to my side to keep me steady
          upon the sudden lightness in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grabbed the pillow, got up from the bed, walked to the dresser,
          pulled it open, picked up my phone, turned it on as I walked out of
          the room, and returned to the living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I settled the pillow on one of the long couches and lay there instead,
          pressing a remote to reduce the room's lighting.
        </p>
        <p>My body felt too heavy to carry when I tried to move.</p>
        <p>
          I needed medicine, something to dull the headache. I couldn't
          administer it myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bringing the phone to my view, I squinted with a wince at the light,
          and I quickly moved to reduce the brightness before going to my
          contact list.
        </p>
        <p><i>Five names. </i></p>
        <p>
          I clicked on Angelo's name, which immediately went into voice mail.
          Unavailable to answer the phone. I tried again...and again...same
          result.
        </p>
        <p>
          My throat grew too dry, and my head ached. My breathing was getting
          loud, my breath as hot as my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clicked on Casmiro's name next, but it immediately said unavailable.
          There was no point in trying it again because he wasn't here to
          provide immediate aid—but then again, he could help alert someone
          nearby—I tried calling again. Not available.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes with a tired groan before reopening them. My gaze
          fell on Zahra's name...I contemplated it...thoroughly. She had left
          here a couple of hours ago...she was on the cruise. She was closer,
          and I wanted her here. Although she had taken away my first chance to
          relax, I did not want her to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clicked on her contact name, and it was silent for a few seconds
          before an automated voice came in.
          <i>"Sorry, you are not allowed to call this number."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The line cut immediately. I frowned at the phone, redialing it, and
          the same automated voice came in, repeating the same sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clicked on the message icon next to the call one, which brought me
          to view the numerous messages I had ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sent her a 'hello,' And instead of a delivered notification to pop
          up under the text, it was a 'not delivered' with a bright red
          exclamation mark next to the text.
        </p>
        <p><i>She...blocked me. </i></p>
        <p>
          I pressed my lips together, biting my tongue. My fingers trembled on
          the phone as another wave of coldness hit me.
        </p>
        <p><i>I shouldn't have said anything. Stupid idiot. </i></p>
        <p>
          I left the message page and swiped right on her contact name, my thumb
          hovering on the delete icon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want to click it. But it was the right thing to do. She had
          made it clear with this action where she truly stood.
        </p>
        <p>I felt sicker than before.</p>
        <p>
          Was the thought of being committed to me really that scary? Had I been
          mistaken when she confessed to me the day before?
        </p>
        <p>But she was so sincere...</p>
        <p>I sighed, swiping back.</p>
        <p>
          I dialed Gemma's number afterward, and it didn't ring before it said
          busy, which meant she was on another call. I waited a bit before
          trying again, and it clearly stated.
          <i
            >"The person you are trying to reach is on another call at the
            moment; please try again later."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>I closed my eyes, releasing a hot breath from my heavy chest.</p>
        <p>"Why are you surprised, my love."</p>
        <p>I froze.</p>
        <p>
          The voice was right beside me, stressed and winded, soft and warm,
          familiar, too daringly familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes and turned my heavy head to the side. She was seated
          at the center table, facing me.
        </p>
        <p>My mother. Again.</p>
        <p>My stomach turned, and I clenched my jaw.</p>
        <p>
          "You thought they would answer?" A soft laugh left her. "They never
          answer, Elio, and neither will they ever. Not everyone is like you."
          she smiled. "You have to know that the only people who ever truly
          loved you are just an action away if you would just take that step."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. It was pained; I knew that because I felt it in my chest.
          Tight and choking.
        </p>
        <p>I turned my head.</p>
        <p>
          "You don't like seeing me." she stated, and her voice sounded sad. "It
          shows in your beautiful eyes that you don't. Is that why you won't
          come to me? because you hate me?"
        </p>
        <p>I closed my eyes.</p>
        <p><i>Not real. </i></p>
        <p><i>Not real.</i></p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry, Elio. I know it will take you forever and more to get
          over what I did. But you have to understand...no...I know you
          understand. You want to do it too, burn it all, just like I did. You
          know exactly how I felt. I had to do it, just like you must."
        </p>
        <p>"Please leave me alone," I said softly. "Please."</p>
        <p>
          "I was never there for you, Elio. You were always there for me; you
          never left me alone; why would I leave you now that you need me the
          most? Look at the place; it is empty; you're so alone in this world;
          it saddens me to see you suffering; I want to be here for you."
        </p>
        <p>"No." I croaked out. "You're not real."</p>
        <p>
          "I am as real as you want me to be, Elio. You have no idea how long I
          have been waiting for you to let me see you like this, " she said,
          sounding so pleased. "There's something I have always wanted to tell
          you."
        </p>
        <p>"Please go away." I could barely hear my own voice.</p>
        <p>"But you wanted me here."</p>
        <p>"Mamá, por favor, déjame en paz." I breathed "Por favor."</p>
        <p>"You called me here; I am the one who answered."</p>
        <p>
          I was being tortured; her voice was torture; her presence was torture.
          This is so unfair.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio, I am here."</p>
        <p>
          I pressed my eyelids tightly together. "I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
          I'm not crazy." I chanted.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio,"</p>
        <p>"I'm not cra..."</p>
        <p>
          I felt a shadow over me, her hand on my cheek, so soft and tender.
        </p>
        <p>"My love, open your eyes."</p>
        <p>
          When I did, I flinched sharply with a gasp at the melting face above
          me. Her face was burning; her smile was slipping, her skin was
          falling, eyes drooping. I can't breathe, I can't think, I can't—
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes snapped open, my breathing hard, my phone in my grip against
          my chest, the screen blank.
        </p>
        <p>I had dozed off...that was a dream.</p>
        <p>
          I subtly looked around me. The living room was empty. Too empty. Too
          quiet. Too eerie. Too lonely.
        </p>
        <p>For a sliver of a moment, I felt...scared.</p>
        <p>
          Sinking further into the couch, I brought my phone to my view again,
          and without thinking, I clicked Elia's name, the last one on the list.
          It started ringing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew he wouldn't answer; he didn't know the number after all, and it
          was careless to accept calls from unknown numbers; he should be—
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hola," </i></p>
        <p>
          His voice filled my ear...it was carefree, like he had been laughing
          and picked it up while distracted. He sounded familiar and not
          familiar. There was a bit of noise in his background: water, music,
          laughter.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hello, who is this?" </i>his voice came in again.</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, trying to clear my throat, but it felt like a brick was
          on my chest, stopping my airflow.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hey! Make your fucking shot!" </i>a male voice yelled at him.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Who's that?"</i> A female voice that sounded much like the one who
          rejected me hours ago came through.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Don't know, wrong number, I think, where were—" </i>The line
          disconnected.
        </p>
        <p>
          I drew in a breath, fighting to keep my eyes open as I dialed the
          number again.
        </p>
        <p>It rang three times, and he picked up. <i></i></p>
        <p><i>"Yes?" </i>he drawled. Irritated.</p>
        <p>I opened my mouth to speak, but his voice cut me off.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Breathing at the end of the line is not on trend anymore, so
            whoever you are—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Elia."</p>
        <p>
          He went quiet. And all I could hear was the noise and music in the
          background.
        </p>
        <p>After a good minute that felt like an hour, he spoke.</p>
        <p><i>"Y-yeah? What do you want." </i></p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry to bother you. I did not mean to call, but I—I don't have
          anyone else."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was nothing from him in the first few seconds, but he spoke.
          <i>"What happened?" His voice had a new edge</i>, one that sounded
          urgent, and the other end of the line was shaky like someone was
          running or walking fast with the phone. I was too disoriented to
          decipher it.
        </p>
        <p>"I need...help."</p>
        <p>The line disconnected the moment I spoke.</p>
        <p>
          I groaned out a sigh, giving up as my phone dropped from my hand. I
          relieved my eyes of their stress and closed them again, allowing my
          body succumb to the tiredness.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          I was brought back into mild consciousness when I felt a hand on my
          forehead. The hand was soft, small, and warm, and a familiar
          smell—like my pillow, but stronger, nearer—filled my nostrils.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck, get some Ice, D. He's burning up."</p>
        <p>The sound of fast retreating footsteps was what I heard next.</p>
        <p>
          "I thought you said he was okay." A female voice cut into the silence,
          and I heard some other footsteps.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He was when I left this morning. He was perfect, in fact," The
          hand—Zahra's hand came to my cheek. "Elio?" she called softly. "I
          think he can hear us; he's frowning."
        </p>
        <p>"So, not dying then." Another voice cut in.</p>
        <p>
          Her finger stroked my cheeks, a shadow over me. "Hey, can you hear
          me?" she asked like she didn't want anyone else in the room to hear
          her asking me this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, do you think he took something?" The female voice asked again,
          soft, concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No Milk, he had been drinking...whiskey, and he looked tired too, but
          he wasn't this hot."
        </p>
        <p>"He still looks hot to me,"</p>
        <p>
          "Jesus Dog, I didn't mean that kind of hot—I meant hot as in, sick
          hot—like temperature over the sky roof hot—"
        </p>
        <p>"I know what you meant; just messing with ya."</p>
        <p>
          Some touched my feet like they were feeling for something. "I think he
          has a fever, a bloody strong one; he's cold on his feet."
        </p>
        <p>Zahra's hand covered mine. "His hands too."</p>
        <p>
          Someone clapped, and my head banged. "It's nothing that can't be cured
          with fever soup."
        </p>
        <p>"What's a fever soup."</p>
        <p>"It soup that cures fever, it goes without saying, Milk."</p>
        <p>
          "The way you put it sounded like it's a soup that causes fever and not
          cure it." Milk responded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why the fuck would I imply that? He's already playing catch with
          fucking fever, so when I say fever soup, it should have automatically
          clicked in that pink brain of yours that I meant the one that cures
          it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is there one for causing it?" The one with the British accent spoke.
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking hell, I'm friends with idiots."</p>
        <p>
          "No, actually," Zahra spoke up. "With the way you put it, it just
          sounded like you have one for curing fever and one for causing it..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're also a fucking idiot, Zahra; you just know how to package it."
          Dog groaned out. "Anyway, it's one of my father's secret recipes; his
          grandfather passed it on to him. It was created when my great-grans
          Olga was on the brink of death from fever, and he made a soup and
          brought her back to life, fever gone. Then he made people from the
          church get it for an outrageous amount of money. My great grans died
          two weeks later."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't hear anything else after that. The silence stretched into
          seconds, entering a minute before...
        </p>
        <p>"I really hope Marino didn't hear that." Upper spoke.</p>
        <p>"Me too," Milk seconded.</p>
        <p>
          I squeezed Zahra's hand in mine, and she squeezed back before saying,
          "Nah, he didn't; he's passed out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I found ice and a small towel," Elia's voice entered the room again.
        </p>
        <p>"Permission to use the kitchen, Devil?"</p>
        <p>
          "Why the fuck do you need my permission?" His voice was closer now,
          and right after he spoke, I heard a squeeze of water, and something
          cold and soothing was on my forehead.
        </p>
        <p>"Uh, you're the brother?"</p>
        <p>
          "Dog, will the soup help?" Zahra spoke up, stroking my forearm through
          the hoodie sleeve.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Guaranteed, tested, and 5% out of a hundred, trusted, but he's young,
          so...I don't think he'll die in two weeks."
        </p>
        <p>"What?" Elia snapped.</p>
        <p>"You have Elio's permission." Zahra cut in.</p>
        <p>
          There was a slight snort sound. "<i>Girlfriend</i> speak for
          <i>boyfriend</i>, I see."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not like he can speak for himself; get to the fucking kitchen
          and stop fucking around." Elia groaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Or maybe I could just leave and fuck my way around this cruise
          because someone can't seem to appreciate when a friend is doing
          something for their sudden brother who he doesn't like, but has to
          help, because he doesn't want him to die like my great grans Olga,
          bless her soul." Dog muttered.
        </p>
        <p>There was a second of silence before Elia cleared his throat.</p>
        <p>"Please. Dog. Help. Me."</p>
        <p>
          "Maybe a little less strained, something forthcoming, from the heart—"
        </p>
        <p>"Dog for the love of God." Zahra gritted out.</p>
        <p>
          "Fine, just because Zahra mentioned God, and I love God, so, yeah,
          I'll help." He said, and I could hear the smugness. "Milk, you want to
          be useful?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, coming."</p>
        <p>"What about ingredients?" Upper asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm sure it's all there, I checked the catalog for the platinum
          suite, and the stay-in ingredients I saw will do the trick."
        </p>
        <p>"Good."</p>
        <p>Footsteps were retreating.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh my God, there are cats!" That came from Milk. "Awww, he has cats?"
        </p>
        <p>"Shit," Zahra cursed.</p>
        <p>Elia sighed with a small laugh, "Wanna get off the floor?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, please, help me lift him."</p>
        <p>
          There were shuffles, shadows shifting, hands on my shoulders as half
          my body was lifted off the couch, but I was back down soon after,
          except this time, my head wasn't on the pillow; it was on soft
          thighs—Zahra's thighs.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks, the black cat almost clawed my eye out, and I'm not
          exaggerating. They hate me."
        </p>
        <p>"You give off anti-cat behavior. And...they sense bad energy."</p>
        <p>
          "Well, thank you, Upper, that's an accurate observation nobody
          needed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am delighted to have been the one to provide the observation,"
          Upper responded. "Anyway, I know little about the kind of medicine one
          can take to ward off a fever, and the mad headache the poor lad must
          be experiencing."
        </p>
        <p>"You do?" Elia asked, hopeful.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, I took care of myself for a couple years before uh...well yeah,
          and there were some medicines left for me should in case I suffer a
          fever; I could stop by the medical wing and see if they have some of
          those things?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'll come with," Elia said. "Fuck, I don't want to leave—"</p>
        <p>"It's okay; I'm here," Zahra reassured.</p>
        <p>A shuffle, "Okay, you'll call me if anything happens or changes—"</p>
        <p>"Sure, hurry before Dog is done in the kitchen."</p>
        <p>Footsteps were descending, door opening and closing.</p>
        <p>Zahra sighed, and the cloth left my head.</p>
        <p>
          A moment later, it was back, but colder. Her fingers entered my hair,
          stroking softly.
        </p>
        <p>I let out a much steadier breath.</p>
        <p>
          "You're not sick because I didn't give you a response earlier, are
          you? Because that's just fucking embarrassing on your part, and I
          might just change my mind and say no. I'm not about to be dealing with
          this shit every time we fight." She said for only our ears, "And we're
          going to fight every time; I'm a fucking handful; I'm not above
          stabbing or shooting you in the foot even though you make me feel all
          mushy inside; I'm a crazy bitch."
        </p>
        <p>I groaned.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, that's right, groan all you fucking want; you're stuck with me
          now, Dad."
        </p>
        <p>"Please..." I fought out of my dry throat. "Shut up."</p>
        <p>
          "You know exactly what to do to get me to shut up. Get well right now,
          and go back to being healthy because you scared the shit out of Devil,
          and I do not like panicked Devil; it makes me panic, and I hate
          panicking. Why the fuck didn't you call me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I cracked my eyes open slowly, catching her frown almost immediately.
          "You blocked me," I told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't—" she stopped, then her brows went up, eyes widening. "Oh,
          shit, yeah. I did that a while ago because, you know...I wanted to be
          the one to do it first before you did it. You know? Always get the
          upper hand, which by the way, I have the upper hand in this
          relationship, and I have all the control, and you don't have shit. I
          am running this whole game, this whole fucking show, me, you don't a
          say, you get bupkis out of this, zero, nada."
        </p>
        <p>I slowly blinked at her.</p>
        <p>
          "Hold on," she lifted herself a little but held the side of my head
          steady as she settled back down, her phone in her hand.
        </p>
        <p>Her fingers worked on the screen.</p>
        <p>
          "There, unblocked. Not sorry. I can be petty sometimes, and I own my
          pettiness." She cleared her throat. "That's also something you'll have
          to get used to."
        </p>
        <p>"Just say no...it's okay."</p>
        <p>
          "I already said yes. And I told STREET. Too late to back out. If
          anyone is backing out of this relationship, it's me; you don't get to
          call things off, only I have that right; if you ever feel like you're
          tired of me, tell me subtly, and I will end the relationship. For now,
          I'll just give you a set of things you should look out for."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "Hide your credit cards...just hide them...no matter what you do, keep
          them away from me. I'm a thief, and Aladdin has nothing on me. Also,
          you should always respond to my text to avoid me blocking your number
          again in the future, always pick up my calls, and be kind to me, or I
          might just end up killing you...by mistake, and I won't regret it
          because let's be honest, I don't really like you that much."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not done. You can't fall sick; you can't ignore me or whatever
          that shit you did this morning was. You should talk to Devil; you
          should make Cassie stay away from me; you should keep Angelo's fucking
          cat from me; you should—"
        </p>
        <p>"Kiss me."</p>
        <p>"That...was not what I was gonna say,"</p>
        <p>"I know. I'm asking you to kiss me."</p>
        <p>"Oh."</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, turning it briefly towards the kitchen, before
          looking back down at me, bringing a hand to the side of my face as she
          leaned down and softly pressed her lips to mine, her hair tickling my
          ear, falling on either side to frame my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The life force in my chest responded almost immediately her lips
          closed around mine. I felt her somewhat panicked breathing come down;
          I didn't know she was on edge before her whole body relaxed. She was
          giving in to me, to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          She broke away. "Fuck—I think we would need a written agreement on
          this control shit."
        </p>
        <p>"If that's what you want, I'll arrange it."</p>
        <p>
          She kissed me again, letting it linger a moment, but then broke away.
          "You taste like alcohol." Her finger brushed my chin. "How much did
          you have to drink?" she asked, concern lining her brows.
        </p>
        <p>"A lot."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "I wanted to sleep. It's getting so hard to...to sleep these days."
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, her hand feeling my neck. "Hopefully, something Upper gets
          is strong enough to knock you out, or I could just—knock you out, a
          quick blow to the side of your head, you'll be out like a sack of—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my hand, palmed her face, and pushed her head back away from
          me, closing my eyes and muttering, "You are terrible at this,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She chuckled, removing the cloth from my forehead and pressing it back
          later.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey," I called, my eyes still closed.</p>
        <p>"Yeah?"</p>
        <p>"You told my brother about us,"</p>
        <p>"Yup, told everyone."</p>
        <p>"Then why is he here?"</p>
        <p>"You called him."</p>
        <p>"I know. He doesn't...hate me enough not to answer?"</p>
        <p>
          She sighed. "He came running here as soon as the call dropped and had
          us all panicked for a minute. Had me worried 'cause I thought someone
          had tried to kill you or something—with the way he reacted...and well,
          maybe I uh—asked him to talk to you?"
        </p>
        <p>That had me opening my eyes to regard her. "Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "There was so much unnecessary animosity between you two. And I had a
          part to play in that, but aside from that, you're all each other have.
          I would kill to have my own family, like blood relatives who are
          actually related to me by blood in a not so fucked up way. You two
          have that; I just tried to open his eyes a little so it wouldn't be
          hard for you to...to talk to him. I was going to come back here after
          some party we were at and try to talk to you too, even though I know
          it's not my place to do that—"
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you,"</p>
        <p>She nodded slowly, "Yeah, sure,"</p>
        <p>
          "No," I said, feeling a calm wash over me. "Elia is the most important
          person in my life...I will forever be indebted to you, Zahra, for
          talking to him, for being there for him when I wasn't."
        </p>
        <p>Her lips thinned in a close-lipped smile, "Yeah...of course."</p>
        <p>I stared at her for minutes longer, unable to shift my gaze.</p>
        <p>
          Barely satisfied, I closed my eyes again, relaxing into her warmth
          before letting drowsiness retake me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was woken up a moment later, my state of mind in a blur, as I was
          forced to sit up and drink whatever concoction Dog had prepared. It
          had me sweating, even after I had taken the drugs Upper and Elia had
          brought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia had spoken directly to me, asking how I felt, and I responded
          with a nod, to which he let out a relieved breath.
        </p>
        <p>A moment later, someone suggested putting on a movie.</p>
        <p>
          Something called Titanic, and there was a little argument about it; I
          didn't really pay heed to it; I was trying to relax and sink into the
          feeling of Zahra distractedly and discreetly drawing circles inside my
          palm while she hauled insults at Dog, insults that sounded so crude I
          wanted to shield my ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How the fuck do you watch Titanic while you're kind of in the middle
          of the ocean?"
        </p>
        <p>"It makes it feel more real."</p>
        <p>"No, that shit is scary,"</p>
        <p>
          They were all bringing back my headache with their back and forth, but
          I kept quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were junks everywhere, the room wasn't empty, I could no longer
          hear the loud quiet, it was no longer lonely, and when they all agreed
          to watch the movie, it was quiet again and comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know how long it was, but it was a long time because the big
          screen began to display a sinking ship after a lot of scenes, and Milk
          was already crying; everyone had a solemn look in their eyes,
          including Zahra who had a sad frown on her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Me; I did not like what I was watching on the screen. I did not like
          the chaos or the screams from the actors; I did not like the music in
          the background. I did not like the death and the hysteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision blurred, and in my head, all I could hear, all I could see,
          was the fire, the screams from my siblings and my mother, the chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, relaxing back on the couch and letting my head rest
          on Zahra's shoulder, begging for sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for once, I didn't really have to beg; it came...though it took
          its precious time; but with the quiet noise in the background, the
          warmth from Zahra's shoulder and her hold against my hand, I drifted
          off to sleep, and allowed the days trauma slip out of me.

          <b>"YOU ARE </b>foolish boy! How you go to ocean and not take blood
          test first! You want to die? You want to be fish food?" Gran Louisa
          exclaimed, her face zoomed in on the screen of Gemma's phone, and her
          eyes filled with worry and concern for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thing called <i>genuine care</i>...It felt strange, different,
          and overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had utterly neglected and underestimated the progression of things
          after STREET came into my life. It used to be Casmiro and Angelo I
          worried about because I was satisfied with Elia's hatred for me, but
          now it wasn't just them; now it was Elia, Zahra, Gemma, Gran Louisa,
          Casmiro, Angelo, and maybe even STREET if I were to give it a stretch.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I never knew I would catch a fever, Gran Louisa," I told her with an
          apologetic look.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Nonna, he was so healthy when we got here," Gemma said from her
          position on the couch beside me, Sailor against her chest, Mimi
          sleeping by my side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can you tell when death will come? No. You have to prepare to make it
          go before it come. Fever is bad. Fever kill Gaida child at age 16.
          Remember Giada from church, the Gaida who wear lipstick every day?"
          she said, her lips pursed as if to drive her point home.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, Nonna, but Elio is better now. He had some friends over, and
          they took care of him. His new girlfriend was here too!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Gran Louisa's eyes widened, a shocked gasp leaving her. "You have
          girlfriend now, Elio?"
        </p>
        <p>I turned my head to pin Gemma with a stare, and she beamed at me.</p>
        <p>"Answer now!" Gran Louisa yelled.</p>
        <p>"Yes, that is...hm," I cleared my throat, "correct."</p>
        <p>"Let me see! I need to know if she deserve pretty man like you."</p>
        <p><i>I don't deserve her.</i></p>
        <p>
          "She left," I told the anticipating woman, "They had an
          <i>event</i> to attend on the cruise."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gran Louisa nodded. "Okay, bring girlfriend home when you leave Ocean;
          I will cook for her and ask her important question."
        </p>
        <p><i>Home.</i></p>
        <p>I almost smiled as I nodded. "Okay."</p>
        <p>
          "I will go now; I have church. Gaida is making cookie for us, it will
          not be good, but I have to prepare for lie. Poor Gaida."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma laughed, shaking her head. "Okay, Nonna, talk to you later."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bye-bye." She responded with a wave while her hand came close to the
          screen as the call ended.
        </p>
        <p>Gemma sighed as I handed her the phone and let my head fall back.</p>
        <p>
          "Now I have to contrive a way to tell her my<i> girlfriend</i> would
          never be available to see her."
        </p>
        <p>
          The culprit angled her body to face mine, but I didn't turn my head to
          look at her. "Never Say Never, Justin Bieber knew what he was talking
          about when he sang that song."
        </p>
        <p>"I do not know who that is."</p>
        <p>
          "I know you don't; I'll be surprised if you did." She said, laughter
          in her voice. "My main focus now is when and how you'll introduce us.
          The first time we met, it wasn't really great, and now she knows my
          face but doesn't know who I am; so before she sees me again with you
          and jumps into conclusion, you—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will introduce you both," I cut her off, turning my head to her,
          "When I am positive, she won't kill you, and then me."
        </p>
        <p>Gemma blinked at me. "Wh-what?"</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra is... quick-tempered. I made a mistake by not telling her who
          you were when she first saw you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma nodded, her teeth closing on her bottom lip. "Right, you're
          right. You might need to lay it on slow so she doesn't
          misunderstand."  She blew out a breath. "God, she was—she was
          intimidating. Not in a welcoming way, but I know there's a softie in
          there." she grinned, poking my arm and wiggling her brows. "She likes
          you."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, narrowing my eyes and looking away. "Nothing special."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh please..." her tone turned sharp, "spare me the false modesty and
          self-degradation. You are the most likable person I know."
        </p>
        <p>"You are naïve, Gemma."</p>
        <p>
          "Probably, but I have that good people tingle. I know when I see a
          good person."
        </p>
        <p>"I advise that you check the tingle. Might be broken."</p>
        <p>
          She laughed, and I shook my head. Appreciating the fact that I could
          carry out that action without my pain
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra and STREET had stayed till the morning, but then they had to
          leave for some casino bet they made...I did not want to know more or
          indulge them in their thieving activities, but Zahra had stayed an
          hour longer, and Elia had told me he would stop by later for a talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I had been pretending that I wasn't overthinking what that
          talk would entail.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I didn't know what I wanted or where I stood with
          everything I wanted to do. My goal was not to settle with Elia; it was
          the opposite. But that didn't extirpate the inconvenient fact that I
          wanted to talk to him, rebuild our relationship, and have him look at
          me like I was his family, his brother, his protector, his friend. I
          missed that...
        </p>
        <p>But.</p>
        <p>Right, and wrong swung tennis balls back and forth in my head.</p>
        <p>Settle or ruin.</p>
        <p>Happy or Sad.</p>
        <p>Peace or Chaos.</p>
        <p>Build a heart or break one.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Gemma's voice brought me out of my head. "On a serious note,
          I'm happy for you. First relationships are always tough, but they're
          the most amazing; it all feels new, and the person looks like the sun
          when you see them," she spoke like she remembered her experience. 
          "But I know you'll be great. She's very lucky; you're a really good
          guy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned my head to her again and gave an appreciative nod. "Thank
          you, Gemma."
        </p>
        <p>"Of course," she grinned. "How do you feel now?"</p>
        <p>"Good. A lot stronger than I did yesterday."</p>
        <p>
          Gemma had arrived after Zahra left, although she had texted to ensure
          the coast was clear first.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been worried when I informed her through text to avoid my
          suite because I had company due to a fever. When she arrived, she told
          me she must have been on the phone with Luigi when I called.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then she told me how Luigi had been sending her pictures of
          himself in a penthouse—to brag—according to her.
        </p>
        <p>When she showed me the pictures, it was with a scowl on her face.</p>
        <p>
          She and Luigi had a brother-sister-like relationship, constantly
          bickering and teasing. Apparently, just as Gran Louisa had named me a
          family member, she did the same with Luigi. Although I didn't care and
          would probably not like to know about anything regarding Luigi or
          anyone else if I was being honest, I now had some obligation to
          listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father would have hated this, me associating with people outside of
          the family and the business. But they made me feel almost normal; I
          would not change that for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being with Gemma and hearing Gran Louisa say, 'Bring Zahra home' like
          I had every right to be there, warmed my chest and broke my heart—this
          was a helpless situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A situation where help was within reach, within grasp, where everyone
          wanted the same thing for me...
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Get some help, Elio, see a doctor, Elio, consort a specialist,
            Marino, I think you need a therapist, I think you need help.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolutely delightful. I knew I needed help; I knew I would get worse.
          This was how it started with my mother, the little mumblings, loud
          thoughts, hallucinations, lucid dreams, repetitive movements,
          repetitive words, self-harm...how she would claim to hear voices, how
          she lost interest in the things she loved doing, her lack of showing
          emotions—the total apathy, the fear—the same one I felt yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
          That fear had been small but so deep, so meaningful that it sent a
          chill down my spine, although I couldn't be sure if it were the fever
          or if it was my body showing me symptoms—I honestly couldn't be sure
          of anything these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was even worse that I knew this—I knew I needed help, but that
          voice—those words...<i>I am undeserving of it. I don't need help. </i
          >They kept playing in my head whenever I even dared to consider the
          idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted it, but that want had never been strong enough to bring forth
          a need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until Angelo pointed out that I might have been made to think I didn't
          deserve the help, I began to look at things in a different light.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father had been so against me getting professional and proper help.
          He didn't want to hear it or think about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had always been yelling at my father, telling him my mother needed
          help, and getting that for her was the right thing to do...but
          suddenly, I couldn't apply that same vigorousness to myself.
        </p>
        <p>I don't know if I want to.</p>
        <p>I don't know what I want.</p>
        <p>I don't know who I am.</p>
        <p>
          I don't know why my thoughts are breaking up or why the urge to speak
          them out loud seemed like the most relieving thing in the world—
        </p>
        <p>
          "Marino!" Angelo's voice from the entrance, and the door closing
          behind me, broke my thoughts and got Gemma's attention. "I got your
          text; I brought in all your pills and refill—oh—" I turned to see
          Angelo standing a few feet away, a surprised frown on his face.
          "Uh...fuck, I never mean to always interrupt, but if you could give me
          a heads-up next time so I wouldn't barge in and interrupt you
          with...someone else?" confusion dragged his brows down even further.
        </p>
        <p>"Hello, Angelo, meet Gemma; Gemma meet Angelo; we work together."</p>
        <p>
          Gemma had a stunned look in her eyes, her jaw was hanging, and she had
          wholly loosened her hold on Sailor as she bent slowly toward me,
          taking her eyes off Angelo. "You didn't tell me he was hot," she
          rushed out.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You didn't tell me he was freaking hot; you didn't tell me he was
          swimming with hotness. Are you insane not to have prepared me for
          that?" she whispered loud enough for both me and Angelo to hear.
        </p>
        <p>"I did not think it was important."</p>
        <p>
          "You evil being! I am about to make a complete fool out of myself in
          front of probably the hottest man I have ever seen—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can—I can hear everything," Angelo pointed out, and Gemma snapped
          up straight with a broad smile that almost made her ears fall off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her get off the couch, standing like she couldn't bear to
          sit down when he was in the room. "Hi, yes—I knew you could hear me,
          and I know my face is a tomato, ketchup? Depending on the level of
          redness, it could be a strawberry milkshake—those pinkish-red ones
          with the cute little ice cubes inside and the beautiful straw that
          come with the cup. And I don't know why I am talking about strawberry
          milkshakes or milkshakes at all because there is no milkshake here. I
          tend to embarrass myself a lot..." Silence stretched until she added
          "Ha!" for good measure or a closing statement. I couldn't tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo blinked, flustered. "Hi, Gemma; a pleasure to meet you. I'm
          sorry about barging in—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh no, no, no, nothing like that; Elio and I are buddies, we roll
          with the flow of friendship, and uh...there's nothing—you didn't
          interrupt anything at all, we were just talking about friends things,
          you see."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo nodded. "Friends..." His gaze shifted to me. "Oh..." and then
          he looked back at Gemma, "He has mentioned you."
        </p>
        <p><i>I have?</i></p>
        <p>"He has?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah...a long time ago." then his gaze fell back to me, "This is
          Gemma, yeah, the one you got the phone for?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma's lips fell open. "What? You bought your phone because of me?"
        </p>
        <p>"You wanted me to text you," I stated.</p>
        <p>
          "Awww," Gemma's face softened. "that is so cute and sweet. I will
          forever treasure this information."
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed a stretch of seconds to go by, unsure of what to say before
          I settled with an "Okay."
        </p>
        <p>
          She beamed, looking back at Angelo. "Nice to meet you too, Angelo;
          Elio has said so much about you, and Mimi, God, she's such a doll."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched a smile come onto Angelo's lips. "Isn't she? Is that yours?"
          he gestured to Sailor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yup, she's mine." Gemma quickly picked him up with a grin as Angelo
          approached, dropping the bag he brought in front of me before
          collecting Gemma's cat, cooing.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, she's heavy and soft, wow."</p>
        <p>
          "She loves to be spoiled, and my Nonna made it a habit to take extra
          care of her."
        </p>
        <p>Mimi perked up from beside me before she started meowing loudly.</p>
        <p>
          "Attention seeker one minute and a stranger the next," Angelo said,
          handing Sailor to Gemma as he bent to pick Mimi, kissing her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good. Now that we are done with meeting the cats and the people, can
          you explain to me why there are so many pill bottles?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo dropped his cat down again. "There are only four. Two of them
          are just the dosage you need to take before bed tonight; I'll hold on
          to the rest cases until I get back."
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you," but then I frowned. "Where are you going again?"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, I heard there were some mountains not far off. I booked a boat
          from the cruise alongside others who wanted to check it out, just
          sightseeing. Are you interested?"
        </p>
        <p>"No. I'm expecting someone."</p>
        <p>He frowned. "Who?'</p>
        <p>"My brother."</p>
        <p>
          His brows rose up. "Oh. That's good." He looked pleased. "That's
          great." He said, nodding the same way Gemma was nodding now.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, I suppose."</p>
        <p>"And I suppose she knows too?" he gestured to Gemma.</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>Angelo nodded, "Just how close are you both again?"</p>
        <p>
          "Met the grandma close," Gemma supplied. "But like, not in a seek her
          hand in marriage kinda way...more of in a friends kinda way."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's great," Angelo looked at me, surprised but happy. "Glad you
          took my advice."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Hm."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh uh..." Gemma spoke up. "if you need company to check out the
          mountain, I'd love to go."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo smiled at her. "Of course, but we have to go now. We have just
          minutes to prepare."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma dropped Sailor with an enthusiastic nod. After Angelo took the
          rest of my pills with him and Gemma kissed my cheek goodbye, they left
          the apartment.
        </p>
        <p>I was alone again, but it didn't feel as distant as yesterday.</p>
        <p>
          Pulling out my phone, I went to Zahra's message space, seeing the
          failed message still alight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, and a sound went off on my phone, a message from her
          popping up in the chat box.
        </p>
        <p><b>Zahra: </b><br /><b>Hey, what's up? </b></p>
        <p>Almost like my mind had called her into texting me. I responded.</p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Hello.</b></p>
        <p>Her response came after a few seconds.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Zahra:</b><br /><b>How are you feeling? Do you need anything?</b>
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. Confused.</p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Who is this?</b></p>
        <p><b>Zahra: </b></p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Some random dude who kidnapped this phone's owner and tied her up
            below deck because I have a nasty grudge to pick with her.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Okay. Good luck.</b></p>
        <p><b>Zahra:</b><br /><b>It's me, you fucking asshole. Wtf?</b></p>
        <p><b>Zahra:</b><br /><b>Goodluck? </b></p>
        <p><b>Zahra:</b><br /><b>Who the fuck says that?</b></p>
        <p>The messages popped in three consecutive times, with no break.</p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Hello, Zahra.</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>Me: </b><br /><b
            >I replied based on your earlier response. Regarding your question
            about how I am doing, yes, I am all right. Thank you for checking
            in, and No, I do not need anything.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I sent that and waited for her response, but nothing came afterward. I
          sat there in silence, waiting...waiting—I scrolled back to her first
          message and read through, and then through my responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did I miss something? Should I add one of the yellow round faces? Was
          my response too formal? How do I make it informal? What—
        </p>
        <p><b>Zahra:</b><br /><b>Ok. </b></p>
        <p>
          I frowned...tempted to ask who this was again. Instead, I typed out
          something else.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Where are you?</b></p>
        <p>Her response took two minutes, thirty-nine seconds.</p>
        <p><b>Zahra:</b><br /><b>Room. </b></p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Have you returned from the casino?</b></p>
        <p>This time it took longer, three minutes, forty-eight seconds.</p>
        <p><b>Zahra: </b><br /><b>Yh.</b></p>
        <p>
          Guessing that was supposed to mean yes, I sent in another response.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>All right. </b></p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Are you occupied at the moment?</b></p>
        <p>Six minutes, twenty seconds.</p>
        <p><b>Zahra: </b><br /><b>Yh.</b></p>
        <p>
          I sighed, knowing I had probably said something wrong along the way.
          Then again, I wasn't well versed in making or keeping conversations
          and did not know how to turn off formalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also saw no reason to apologize for doing nothing wrong, so I
          reacted with a thumbs up and left her chat box, getting the non-spoken
          message that she didn't want to talk to me.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe she was indeed busy.</p>
        <p>
          Or maybe I was making excuses. Perhaps I should go to Angelo for
          advice on what to say and what not to say. I needed to be more
          knowledgeable. This was new. This was fragile. This was another first
          I knew nothing about.
        </p>
        <p>This is me overthinking it.</p>
        <p>
          I released a breath, looking around the space slowly, my feet tapping
          the ground repeatedly, my fingers tapping my thigh, the quietness
          growing too loud, the emptiness swallowing me whole, my ears becoming
          dull...and suddenly, I was on my feet. I walked to the bar table,
          opened a cabinet, and removed a cigar box.
        </p>
        <p>
          I placed one stick between my lips, lit the end, and took a long drag,
          long enough that I could not drag in more smoke.
        </p>
        <p>I let the toxic cloud circulate my system and—</p>
        <p>
          Someone knocked, and I flinched in a startle, forgetting I wasn't
          breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          On cue, I entered into a fit of coughs, dropping the cigar on the
          ashtray as I pounded my chest with my fist, coughing with a wincey
          sound, barely registering the smoke escaping my nose and mouth. My
          vision blurred as I tried calming down, taming the cough, and taking
          proper breaths.
        </p>
        <p>The knock came in again.</p>
        <p>
          I took in my breathing little by little, gasp after gasp. The coughs
          calming. I blinked my vision clear, making my way towards the door,
          clearing my throat, and getting a bit of control on myself again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened the door, and Elia stood there, looking up from his shoes and
          directly at me; his face morphed into instant concern. "What is...why
          are your eyes red?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cigar. Cough." I clarified, opening the door wider before turning and
          returning to the living room. The sound of the door closing, and his
          footsteps, following me was what filled the silence. "Want anything to
          drink? You can help yourself. I have verities," I said, settling on a
          single couch while he settled on another with Sailor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, I'm good." He said, finger grazing his jaw as unsure gaze looked
          around.
        </p>
        <p>"I—"</p>
        <p>"You should quit."</p>
        <p>I stopped short, frowning. "What?"</p>
        <p>He raised his gaze. "Smoking. It's not good. You should quit."</p>
        <p>I did not take my eyes off him as I said, "It helps me."</p>
        <p>"Killing you while it's at it."</p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, uncomfortable. "You said you wanted to talk."
        </p>
        <p>
          He brought his palms together, intertwining his hands. "Yeah, I do."
          He answered, "Listen, I don't wanna revisit the past and pull up old
          wounds." He swallowed. "I know things have been rocky, and all our
          conversations have ended up in me hitting and disrespecting you and
          saying shit that I don't mean...I'm sorry if my words hurt you; I was
          angry."
        </p>
        <p>My brain picked apart his words.</p>
        <p>
          "Was?" I stated in question. "Does this mean you're not angry
          anymore?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He pressed his lips together. "I don't know." He stated plainly. "But
          I know I don't want to fight anymore."
        </p>
        <p>"You don't want to know why I broke my promise?"</p>
        <p>"It's not going to change anything if I do."</p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head. "You don't want to confirm if I am indeed
          responsible for the death of my mother and siblings."
        </p>
        <p>He paused, watching me with a battle in his eyes. "Are you?"</p>
        <p>
          Silence stretched into minutes, and then I shrugged, leaning back.
          "Might have not started the fire, but it doesn't mean I'm not to blame
          for it."
        </p>
        <p>"What does that mean?"</p>
        <p>
          My eyes searched his. "When I let you go, Elia, I let everyone go.
          When I let you down, I also let everyone down. My mother, Marianna,
          Lorenzo." I said, looking away from him. "I let myself down. I lost
          purpose; I lost a lot...but I had hope that I would come back and see
          them again. I would meet you again, apologize and get on my knees if I
          had to. But then I got out, got back...and it was all ashes. Hours too
          late. Minutes too long, doing absolutely nothing while standing by my
          father's side. If I had—done things differently,
        </p>
        <p>
          Stand up to my father, put a bullet in his head, and told him I didn't
          need to join the army to keep my mind in check; maybe things would
          have been different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Days after they died I...I replayed possible scenarios on how things
          could have gone differently, how I could still keep them alive," I
          looked back at him. "Keep you here. I have regretted my actions every
          day till now. I deserve to pay for the pain that caused you, my
          mother, Maria, and Enzo.
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels wrong to be respected, loved and praised because I did
          nothing worthy of being respected, especially by you. So, you do not
          have to apologize for that. I deserve it and worse."
        </p>
        <p>"No, it's—"</p>
        <p>
          "Let me finish," I told him. "I am happy that you decided to talk to
          me and give me a chance. But I also want to let you know that it is
          completely okay if you do not want to give me a chance; you don't have
          to. If you are angry, be angry; if you feel like hitting me, do not
          hesitate. Feel what you want to feel. Do not spare my feelings."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, "That's not what I'm trying to do." He said, "I
          meant it when I said I didn't want to fight anymore, Elio. I want—I
          know everything can't automatically go back to how it used to be,
          but—we can try to fix what we can. You're my only family, and
          regardless of the past, I still worry and care about you. Just the
          same way you do for me."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." I nodded. "And if I'm not mentally available at all times?"</p>
        <p>
          "You don't have to be. I'm a grown-up; I have my own shit to deal with
          now. I just want to clear the air."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "And Zahra? Am I to assume you have no concerns with
          our...recent relationship?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His mouth opened and closed, and his hand moved to his neck as he
          spoke. "It is weird; I'm not gonna lie, but—I see it. You care about
          her, and she surprisingly cares about you. As long as you're both in
          check with each other, then it's none of my business."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." I nodded again. "You harbor no feelings for her? If you do,
          please tell me, I will break things off."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love Zahra; she's my best friend, always has been, but—things
          aren't like that. I thought they were at some point until I realized
          that wasn't the kind of love that you share with someone you want to
          be with."
        </p>
        <p>
          He was picking his words, but I didn't have a right to call him out on
          it.
        </p>
        <p>"This was good; I appreciate you making the effort, Elia."</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra says I need bragging rights. Had to snag it," he said, looking
          around. "Do you just stay here? Only you? doing nothing?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          Then he looked back at me. "Wanna come over to our suite, Upper and
          Dog are setting up a game at the lounge, and Milk ordered excess
          food."
        </p>
        <p>"And Zahra?"</p>
        <p>
          "Uh...in her room? She went in after the Casino and never came out; I
          don't know about now...Why?"
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing."</p>
        <p>
          Elia prepared to get up, "Would you like to join?" he asked, sounding
          hopeful. "Or if you have work and things to do, I understand—"
        </p>
        <p>"I will join."</p>
        <p>He couldn't mask the surprise on his face. "Alright,"</p>
        <p>"The cats."</p>
        <p>
          His gaze dropped to them. "We can take them if you want. Milk loves
          them, so she'll be glad."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Okay."</p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I agreed to this for three reasons. One was because Elia
          asked, and after our conversation, I needed to cement my decision with
          this; two was because the idea of staying here alone wasn't appealing,
          I knew I would start seeing and hearing things, thanks to paranoia,
          and Three—three was because of Zahra. Either I had offended her
          through my texts, or something else had happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something else had happened, then I wanted to know. I hated
          texting, hated the fact that I couldn't see her face, to know what
          changed, why it changed, how it changed, when it changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I needed to see her. The need was like a thirst on my tongue that I
          needed to sate. I needed this. It. Her.
        </p>
        <p>She took the quietness and my urges away. She was my new habit.</p>
        <p>Unhealthy, I know.</p>
        <p>
          But then again, I have never been one to cut off unhealthy habits; why
          must I start now?

        <p>
          <b>"I MEAN</b>, it's normal to get tired of the hustle and bustle,"
          Milk muffled out, chewing on the potion of pizza she had just eaten.
          "You just want to settle down and have a comfortable life," she
          swallowed, picking up her drink. "living your dream, having everything
          you want, affording every need without having to steal or cheat or
          kidnap someone, you know?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I responded to her ideology with a firm nod, unsure how the easy
          conversation had turned into what they would desire to do with their
          lives after they quit the criminal activities they were known for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sucking on the straw of her drink and gulping down its content, she
          dropped it back beside her when she was satisfied. "If I could have
          had my way with life, I would have wanted something peaceful...like
          finishing college, opening a fashion line, having a salon that's like
          paradise, a spa place, a good boyfriend, and a perfect family, living
          in some perfect house somewhere in New York..." she sighed. "I still
          plan to do it if we get that gold...I wanna be normal."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper nodded, relaxing on the ground, his back leaning against the
          couch Dog sat on. "If I could have a do-over, I would have fought more
          for what I deserved."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should have," Dog muttered after taking a drink from the beer
          bottle he held. "You came from money...if I were you, no one is
          booting me out that easy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't certain what precisely they were talking about. But reading
          the room, it had to do with Upper's past.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been here for two hours. I wasn't bored, but I was superiorly
          out of place; though these bunch didn't point out any oddity, they
          probably did not find anything bugging about my presence. Usually, I
          would call this careless, but I was seventy-eight percent sure they
          were cordial because Zahra and Elia found a substantial reason to be
          cordial with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would not deny that being here was entirely...relaxing; it made me
          feel complacent to pull off being amongst these people; my thoughts
          were tranquil; they suddenly didn't matter.
        </p>
        <p>Zahra, though, hadn't left her room since I arrived.</p>
        <p>
          Milk had offered to alert her about my presence, but I refused,
          deciding to speak to her in my own time while I got to know the people
          my brother spent his time with.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was almost twelve and scared of what I was," Upper answered. "The
          royal family did not exactly love me before; well, I left."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "Royal family?"</p>
        <p>
          There was silence around as they looked at me with confused stares.
        </p>
        <p>"You didn't know?" Elia asked first.</p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>
          "I thought y'all ran some shit storm of background check on us?" Dog
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We did." I answered, "Casmiro did." I clarified, "But I did not
          bother to check it myself."
        </p>
        <p>"Why?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>"I did not care enough to waste time checking."</p>
        <p>"Oh..."</p>
        <p>"Why were you sent out of the royal family?"</p>
        <p>
          Upper shifted uncomfortably. "I don't like to talk about it," he said,
          gaining Elia's attention. "It's uh...very rough, panic-inducing
          rough."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched Upper's gaze lock with Elia's, which lingered for accurately
          three seconds before Elia looked away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, I despised my invasive, unnatural, and observant nature. I
          despised it because I did not want to learn some things half the time,
          but I ended up learning them anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," Upper said while breathing in. "One thing I want to do, after
          we get that gold, is start up my education again. go to college, learn
          more, and get a job that pays."
        </p>
        <p>"What about you, Dog?" Milk blurted the question.</p>
        <p>
          Dog brows snapped down in a frown. "Why the fuck did you attack me
          like that?"
        </p>
        <p>She blinked. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You just asked like you have been dying to know what I would have
          done with my life and what I want to do."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pressed her lips together, cheeks going pink. "I mean..." she was
          flustered now. "Isn't that what—what we're all doing?"<br />
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, you just came on too—"</p>
        <p>
          "Dog, just answer the bloody question." Upper spoke above him,
          glancing at Milk and deciphering her sudden distress.
        </p>
        <p><i>What a mess.</i></p>
        <p>
          Dog sighed, raking his fingers through his hair, scattering the
          already scattered arrangement. "Well...if there were one thing I could
          re-do, I would ask my parents the question that had been burning in my
          mind when they brought me to Italy. The simple question of 'why?'"
        </p>
        <p>"Wanna expatriate?" Elia asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I got nothing to hide. My parents were murdered a week after they
          brought me here. My dad was an agent for the CIA, and my mom was a
          cop. When I get the gold, I will join the FEDs and find out what
          happened to them. They were pretty big with people who were people, so
          with a little digging, I can find my answers." He shrugged, "You don't
          know what people would be willing to reveal with a briefcase filled
          with gold on their desk."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So," I started. "A thief wants to join the federal bureau of
          Investigation. How do you suppose that would work without proper
          procedures."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have money; nobody knows I'm a thief; my background is a clean
          slate; I'm smart, I'll train, I'll do whatever it takes." He said, a
          determination in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "Impressive." I commended, "If you ever need to talk about
          this, 'whatever it takes,' my doors are always open."
        </p>
        <p>Dog blinked at me. "For...real?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. I have a few favors owed to me by people who might be able to
          answer your questions; I can grant you a favor too."
        </p>
        <p>"What's the catch?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          "You owe me a favor, one I will probably not have enough time to
          collect, but it could help you."
        </p>
        <p>He observed me, "Alright, we'll see."</p>
        <p>I responded with a firm nod.</p>
        <p>
          "What about you," Upper gestured to Elia. "What would you change, and
          what would you do with the gold?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia's gaze lifted to look around the group, settling on me for a bit,
          allowing me to see that he was caught off guard, despite knowing the
          question was going around. "I..." he trailed off, eyes unsure, "I..."
          he looked down at the drink he held and shrugged. "Don't really know.
          There's nothing I would change...there's nothing to change. As for the
          gold, I don't really care about it. I might travel, uh..." he looked
          <i>lost,</i> like he didn't know what he had planned or hadn't thought
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes held this heavy cloud like his whole life had been a blank
          sheet. He didn't know what to write on it or where to start
          writing...the middle, the top, the bottom—or maybe I wasn't reading
          him right, perhaps this thing I saw didn't stem from how I had erased
          him—He cleared his throat, "Um...I don't know. I guess I haven't
          really thought about it." he said, drinking from his beer bottle like
          he didn't want to speak any further.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you, Marino?" Dog asked. "You're not taking the gold, so the
          question there is, what would you change?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought about the question and allowed the silence to stretch as my
          gaze focused on the littered center table, a vivid representation of
          my life since I was born. A clear picture was painted before me, a
          mockery of the irony in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, "Nothing." I answered with the truth. "I would change
          nothing."
        </p>
        <p>"For real?" Elia asked, shock evident in his voice.</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. I believe the only people with the right to change something are
          the ones who deserve the do-over." I answered him, removing my gaze
          from the table. "I would change nothing, but it doesn't mean I will
          not correct everything."
        </p>
        <p>Then it was silent.</p>
        <p>
          "You see," I continued. "Changing doesn't have the same effect as
          correcting. Changing means losing yourself and the person you've grown
          to become; correcting, rather, is most effective because you get to
          grow into something better, you get to look back at the past
          <i>you</i>, and you get to own the pride for how far you've come. Our
          past makes up most of who we are; the future is much sweeter, but the
          present is where the work is, what you're willing to do, to correct
          and to grow."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched them let my words sink in. Almost two minutes flew by;
          everyone was lost in their own head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," Milk said, swallowing tightly. "You just answered a
          question I didn't realize I had been asking all my life."
        </p>
        <p>"Me too," Upper echoed.</p>
        <p>Dog raised his beer bottle to me with a tight smile.</p>
        <p>
          While Elia just stared at me with a frown, one that didn't come from
          anger but concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're welcome. Glad I could...help," I paused a little before
          adding. "unintentionally." I cleared my throat. "I should go check on
          the missing member before I leave; I have Casmiro arriving today."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh yes, he said." Upper spoke up.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, getting to my feet as Milk commented to Upper about talking
          to Casmiro; it brought up a debate I tuned out, walking towards
          Zahra's room, where Milk had gestured to early on when I arrived.
        </p>
        <p>Standing in front of the door, I knocked three times.</p>
        <p>There was no response.</p>
        <p>
          I waited a few seconds before raising my hand and knocking again
          thrice.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got no response, I placed my hand on the knob, debating on
          leaving it be or walking in without a response from her. Walking in
          would be rude; I would hate if someone did that to me without waiting
          for a response...<i>but she did the same to me a long time ago. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          What if she needed help and couldn't talk because she had choked
          herself with the wire of a...hair dryer?
        </p>
        <p><i>Accidents happen. </i></p>
        <p>
          The option of leaving it be lost the debate, and I found myself
          twisting the knob and walking into the room.
        </p>
        <p>She was on the bed, on her side, eyes closed, sleeping.</p>
        <p>
          I closed the door behind me softly. My eyes took in the room. It
          wasn't too big, but it felt and looked comfortable; the window was
          covered by a thin white curtain, giving the room a dark but light vibe
          that seemed comfortable for sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>My gaze moved to Zahra again.</p>
        <p>
          She didn't cover herself, so I had a full view of her naked stomach.
          The tiny shirt she wore stopped just below her breast, and her shorts
          were folded at the waist like it was oversized. Her legs were on
          display, lips parted slightly, breathing steady, lost in sleep.
        </p>
        <p><i>Comfortable but careless. </i></p>
        <p>I silently kicked off my shoes, creeping towards the bed.</p>
        <p>I stood right before her sleeping figure.</p>
        <p>
          Dipping one knee into the bed, her body followed my weight, but she
          didn't move.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, knowing how easy it was to overpower her this way. What if
          I had <i>actually</i> wanted to harm her? We would need to discuss
          this. It was one thing to sleep when necessary, but it was another to
          leave yourself completely vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I placed a fist on the mattress beside her head, hovering above her,
          casting a shadow.
        </p>
        <p>Apparently, that action was not enough to alert her—</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes snapped open, unfocused as her hand, with blinding speed,
          slipped under her pillow while her knees lifted, slamming hard against
          my stomach; I lost my balance. I was on my back, and she was
          straddling me, the cold barrel of a gun pressing tightly against my
          throat, she unlocked it from the safety, but before she could pull the
          trigger, my hand forcefully swung hers away, the gun going off, the
          bullet shattering a vase by the side. She immediately brought the
          weapon back to me, about to hit me with the hilt, when I held onto her
          wrist mid-air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her chest was heaving with adrenaline, eyes burning in a dazed anger.
          "Zahra," I called firmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She still fought me, hand pressing my right shoulder down while she
          tried to twist her wrist off my hold.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, hey! Calm down, it's just me."</p>
        <p>"Oh, I know it's you, you motherfucker." She bit out.</p>
        <p>
          I blinked, frowning in confusion, locking my form. "Then why are you
          still fighting me?"
        </p>
        <p>"Why did you sneak up on me?"</p>
        <p>"I did not sneak up on you."</p>
        <p>
          "So, you just hover random people when they sleep? That's
          fucking—<i>grade-20</i>creepy shit, Elio. Nobody does that unless they
          want to fucking kill you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I relaxed, "Did it ever occur to you that I just wanted to kiss your
          forehead?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She backed up like I had said the most ridiculous thing. "Why the
          <i>fuck</i> would you come all the way <i>here</i> to kiss my
          forehead?"
        </p>
        <p>"Because it's a pretty forehead?"</p>
        <p>
          There was a knock on the door before a muffled voice yelled. "Anybody
          dead?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her head turned towards the door and then back to me. She relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice came again. "It's gonna be a shit ton of work to carry a
          body out of this suite without drawing attention to a bloodied
          bedsheet, so I hope for you both sakes, it's a case of injured but
          still breathing."
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman above me stopped fighting as she sighed. "It's your lucky
          day, Dog; I missed!" she yelled back as I let her wrist go, and she
          dropped her hand and the gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can never get a fucking break." Dog muttered, his footsteps
          retreating.
        </p>
        <p>Looking back at me, she sighed.</p>
        <p>"You almost killed me." I pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          "I would have. Always call my name before you make me feel like you're
          about to suffocate me with a pillow. I kill first, ask questions
          later...most times."
        </p>
        <p>"That is not wise."</p>
        <p>"Your opinion was not needed."</p>
        <p>"Hurtful."</p>
        <p>She scoffed, like me, and that word had no relationship.</p>
        <p>
          "Why did you respond that way...when we texted earlier today?" I
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>She raised a brow at me. "Are you seriously asking me that?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, "You have—you're so annoying sometimes, but I'll
          let it slide because you can be weird, but maybe next time, don't
          respond to me like you are trying to send an email to the governor of
          Milan."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have never emailed the governor of Milan; I have people who do that
          for me."
        </p>
        <p>She glared, "Elio."</p>
        <p>
          "I do not—" I breathed. "I do not know how to text like you want me
          to. If you desire to teach me, then I will gladly learn as long as it
          pleases you,"
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, how kind."</p>
        <p>
          "I am kind to you, even though you just tried to kill me, which is a
          clear message that you have no trust in me, which is wise, I must
          commend, but you should appreciate me more; there are lots of terrible
          ways I could have reacted to subdue you."
        </p>
        <p>"Well, you shouldn't have hovered."</p>
        <p>
          I shifted a bit but stilled in a wince. The muscles in my stomach
          ached, telling me that the impact from her knees to my torso had
          bruised me.
        </p>
        <p>
          She noticed my discomfort because now there was a frown on her face.
          "You idiot," she said, her fingers going to unfasten the buttons on my
          shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze left her fingers to her face. My eyes took in all there was to
          take, but it was not enough; her hair, wild and curly, a mess...a
          beautiful mess.
        </p>
        <p>She caught my stare, looked away, and then back in a double take.</p>
        <p>"What." She snapped at me, brows furrowing in annoyance.</p>
        <p>"I like looking at you," I told her.</p>
        <p>
          Her fingers paused their movement on my shirt, eyes searching mine as
          I rose to my elbows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her swallow, watched the way her cheeks grew a darker shade,
          her blinking abnormal, alongside her breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked away from me, fingers working unsteadily on my last button.
          "I think by now you should know those little flirty compliments do
          nothing for me," she said while she pulled my shirt apart, her fingers
          pressing softly on the bruise.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They don't?" I asked, supporting my weight with one elbow while I
          raised my other hand to her hair, smoothing loose strands behind her
          ear.
        </p>
        <p>She raised her head, eyes locking with mine. "No—they don't."</p>
        <p>
          "Are you alright?" I asked with a mock concerned frown, raising myself
          until I was at eye level with her, my hand caressing the side of her
          neck, below her ear, and inside her hair.
        </p>
        <p>Her gaze dropped to my lips. "Yeah, why?"</p>
        <p>"You're flustered."</p>
        <p>"I'm not."</p>
        <p>"It is cute."</p>
        <p>
          "Stop it; those compliments make me cringe; I told you it does nothing
          for me,"
        </p>
        <p>I felt her breath as I drew closer, "You look quite taken by it."</p>
        <p>
          "You are wrong." She said below her voice, her pupils widening in
          size, our body heat mixing.
        </p>
        <p>"I can even hear your heartbeat."</p>
        <p>"No, you can't."</p>
        <p>
          "Then maybe it is mine." My voice was hoarse and raspy but soft as I
          tilted my head to the side, drawing my face closer, the side of my
          nose brushing against hers; our breathing mingling, our lips were so
          close, one push, just one push. "It gets hard to tell sometimes," I
          whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          She closed the distance, her lips catching mine in a kiss that tickled
          my reasoning; my hold on the side of her head held firm as our lips
          moved tentatively, testing the waters, basking in the soft, warm feel,
          dragging it along like we had all the time in the world to feel the
          heat that came with each other's taste, parting to allow the intrusion
          of our tongues, my heart which had been hammering like that was its
          new function, had me feeling dizzy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My teeth bit her bottom lip, pulling softly, letting us catch our
          breaths before we joined our lips together, completely in sync—God,
          <i>I love kissing her. I love it so much</i>. I loved how it made me
          feel like we were lost in a space where time had no effect, a
          standstill that had me thinking that we could do this forever, survive
          on the feverish high, a loop of us getting lost in each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her tongue was soft against mine, and her lips perfectly fit mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Hell</i>, the soft sounds that left her—unguarded, unshielded. A
          trance I couldn't escape—the perfect hypnotism.
        </p>
        <p>This woman has cursed me.</p>
        <p>
          I was aroused; her grinding on my erection served as a predator to the
          prey that was my control.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held her firm as I switched our position, my arousal between her
          legs as I retook her lips, my hand holding on to her hip, squeezing
          before riding up the dip in her waist, her fingers burying themselves
          to the back of my head, tangled around my hair.
        </p>
        <p>We broke away to catch our breaths.</p>
        <p>
          My eyes searched hers. "I'm addicted, Sport." I bit her chin, my
          fingers working between her legs, touching her through her shorts.
          "I'm addicted to you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips parted as she let out a breathy moan, so quiet—for my ears
          only; I almost shivered; I almost asked her to grant me mercy. This
          was killing me; she was killing me. I was so hard, and it was so
          painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never intended for this. I only wanted to talk. But just like every
          other occurrence with us, I could never predict.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kissed down her neck—no, I sucked down her neck, bruising her; she
          liked it because she arched, giving me more room as my hand left
          between her legs, up her stomach as I lifted the small shirt,
          caressing her breast in my hand, loving the feel as my thumb brushed
          her pierced nipple, the coldness of the steel having the same effect
          on my cock as the first time.
        </p>
        <p>Perfect in every word. In every sense.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >And now this is mine...she is mine to touch, my possession. My
            little witch.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Inside her...I need inside her.</p>
        <p>
          I lifted myself a little as my hand came to the folded hem of her
          shorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          She got the message, her shaky hands coming to do the job while I got
          rid of my own clothes.
        </p>
        <p>"The short is Dog's," she said, her voice heavy.</p>
        <p>My eyes snapped to hers, "Do you lack clothes?"</p>
        <p>"No?"</p>
        <p>
          The nonchalance in her voice had me clenching my jaw; something ugly
          and unwelcoming burned in the pit of my stomach, "I don't like it."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled the small shirt over her head, "That's something you'll
          have to sort out with yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was above her in an instant, her naked body beneath me as I held her
          chin, my gaze holding hers as I settled in my place. Between her
          thighs. "We'll discuss this later; for now, shut up.
        </p>
        <p>Her brows snapped down in a frown, "Don't tell me to shut up—"</p>
        <p>
          I kissed her words back down her throat, and she forcefully broke away
          with my lip in her teeth. A sharp pain pinned on my bottom lip; I ran
          my tongue over the area, tasting blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze locked with hers, a challenge in those eyes, mocking me,
          asking what I would do to beat that.
        </p>
        <p>"You love testing me," I said.</p>
        <p>"You forget your boundaries—"</p>
        <p>
          My hand closed around her throat, and I slammed her head back down to
          the pillow, a choking laugh leaving her. "Feisty." She taunted.
        </p>
        <p>
          My cock brushed her core, and she hissed. Her eyes filled with lust
          and thrill; she loved this, loved my control even when she wanted
          papers that proved she was in control at all times.
        </p>
        <p>"What," she continued taunting, "Are you all—"</p>
        <p>
          I slapped the pad of my fingers softly against her left cheek, very
          close to her mouth; her head turned to the side at the impact, clearly
          not expecting that action.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my hold on her neck, I turned her head back until she looked into
          my eyes, those browns now filled with a new kind of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          My thumb grazed her cheek to below her chin, tightening my hold a bit
          before bringing my face and lips closer to hers as I asked, "Can't
          breathe?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A smirk, "We both know I can have you on your back in a second, so
          don't—"
        </p>
        <p>I thrust into her.</p>
        <p>"Fuc—"</p>
        <p>
          I closed my lips around hers, stopping her loud moan before it could
          come out;  as much as my being hungered to hear it, I knew we had to
          be quiet.
        </p>
        <p>But...<i>God</i>.</p>
        <p>
          Her slick wet tight heat hugged my length in a vice grip that had my
          fucking head spinning with desperation. Need—a craving about to be
          satisfied but with an intense longing to prolong.
        </p>
        <p>This feeling. This addiction. This obsession.</p>
        <p>
          It would be my doom. My unraveling. I wanted it. I wanted all of it. I
          wanted her total consumption.
        </p>
        <p>I broke away from her lips.</p>
        <p>A breathy moan left her; it was ragged, loud.</p>
        <p>"You need to be quiet, Querida."</p>
        <p>
          If ecstasy were a face, it would be hers; she defined the word
          perfectly, as I knew she would. My woman was capable of anything, and
          I was proud.
        </p>
        <p>I drew back from her and charged back in.</p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "Shhhh, quiet," I whispered against her lips, my eyes locking with
          hers as I drew out and pushed back in, brutal, unforgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her moan died in her throat, a strained sound as she dug her fingers
          into my biceps, not taking her eyes off me as her teeth pressed down
          on her bottom lip.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's good," I told her, pulling out and slamming back in, her
          throbbing heat holding my length captive, a maddening tease, one that
          made my cock twitch. I pulled and thrust back in, keeping my pace
          hard, a friction that had my pelvis brushing with her clit. "Spread
          your legs wider,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She did, and my hand went to her clit, rubbing as I thrust into her,
          fucking and rubbing those silent breathy moans past her lips, fucking
          and rubbing my name out of her tongue, fucking and rubbing her into a
          zone, lost in me, lost in this, into this feeling that seemed to be
          blooming in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hips lifted to meet my thrusts, rolling, grinding, turning me
          crazed. I dropped my head on her collarbone, "Fuck. That's good, so
          good; you're doing so fucking good, Zahra. <i>Fuck</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't curse often, but my whole damn vocabulary had suddenly gone
          extinct; I could only express myself in ways she had subjected me to;
          every word in my head started with an 'f' ending with a 'k'—her body,
          her voice, her moans. They were all fucking with my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew sex was good, I knew it was fucking additive, I knew it had a
          sweetness to it that could make anyone melt—but I didn't know it could
          be this <i>all-consuming</i>, I didn't know it could make my chest
          ache, I didn't know I could lose myself, my mind, I didn't know it
          could be, so engulfing, so...so—<i>fuck</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          She tightened around me, her legs came close around my waist, and her
          release warmed my cock. Her back arched upwards as I fucked her
          faster, sloppier and—
        </p>
        <p>Fuck, fuck, <i>fuck</i>.</p>
        <p>
          My stomach was in knots, my chest was caving in on itself, and I came
          feverishly inside her, and her arms came around my shoulder, holding
          me like she knew I was about to break, mentally and physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips sought mine, a kiss deeper than anyone we'd shared today,
          passed between us.
        </p>
        <p>Hot. Intimate. Intense.</p>
        <p>
          My speeding heart was supposed to have calmed; my vocabulary was
          supposed to have returned, but—fuck, my heart was still a raging organ
          in my chest. Even as I pulled away from the kiss, sliding out of her
          and falling wordlessly to her side, I could still hear the pounding in
          my chest; my eyes latched onto the ceiling above the bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra let out a contented breath. "Well, wow. It just gets better."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't respond. My eyes were still on the ceiling, my chest rising
          and falling. My mind was numb, my body alive.
        </p>
        <p>"You okay?" Her voice tried to invade my thoughts.</p>
        <p>
          But something was happening to me; some part of my brain was foggy,
          some part of my chest had been left heavy, something changed and
          clicked in place, something gathered and stayed, and something grew.
          Something grew so fucking large, untamable. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Her weight shifted on the bed, and I felt her hand on my chest, her
          eyes on me. "Elio?"
        </p>
        <p>I blinked, turning my head and swallowing when I caught her gaze.</p>
        <p>
          "You look like you've seen a ghost. You just went pale." She said with
          a cautious laugh. "Are you feeling a fever?" she pressed her knuckles
          against my neck.
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>"What happened? Did you remember something?"</p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>"What's going on—"</p>
        <p>"Do you have a chessboard?"</p>
        <p>She frowned, my question seeming to have caught her off guard.</p>
        <p>"W-what?"</p>
        <p>
          "Do you have a chessboard? I have the sudden urge to play,"
          <i>make my brain work normally again. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, uh...you were thinking about chess when you were fucking me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I wasn't thinking when I was—" I stopped, refusing to use the F word
          again. "With you, when I was with you—just now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Something like wary flashed through her eyes, "You're acting weird."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked. "I think we should wash up." And then I was standing,
          leaving the bed, leaving her side, to the in-built bathroom. I closed
          the door and let out a breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          I locked my eyelids tightly together before pulling them back open,
          blocking my thoughts, blocking my mind, blocking whatever this was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dealing with it now was impossible, so I kept it, held it, and
          suppressed it for later.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          I was back in my clothes, and Zahra was coming out of the bathroom
          when I moved to put my shoes on; she frowned at me. "You're leaving?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, I have—"</p>
        <p>
          "You just got here...I mean, if you want to leave, I'm not stopping
          you, but did you just come here for sex?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up at her just in time to see her sitting on the edge of the
          bed, wearing a faded green t-shirt and jean shorts, watching me with a
          confused frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have been here for almost four hours now. I was with your friends
          before I came in here. My intentions weren't to have sex with you. It
          just happened because...well...it was—"
        </p>
        <p>"Do you want to stay?" she asked.</p>
        <p>I paused. "Pardon?"</p>
        <p>
          She cleared her throat. "You hung out with everyone for hours...what
          about me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you want to do?" I asked, schooling my surprise and
          suppressing the warmth in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          She grinned suddenly. "Remember when you wanted us to watch that show
          about Lucifer?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I had no interest in the show or sitting down staring at people
          reading lines from a script. "Yes, I remember."
        </p>
        <p>"We can watch it now."</p>
        <p>
          I had to see Casmiro. He would be arriving today, and I needed to fill
          him in on the progress with Kareem and attend a brief signing meeting
          with—
        </p>
        <p>"If you don't want to, that's fine—"</p>
        <p>"Let's watch it," I said, arranging my shoes back by the side.</p>
        <p>
          She got to her feet, tilting her head as she approached me with a sly
          smile. "Canceling plans for me?"
        </p>
        <p>"Are you going to put it on?"</p>
        <p>
          She reached me, wrapping her arms around my body, startling me with a
          genuine smile while she looked up at me. "That's really nice of you.
          No one has ever canceled plans for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked down at her with a frown, "When was it mentioned by me in the
          past few minutes that I canceled plans for you."
        </p>
        <p>"You didn't have to mention it,"</p>
        <p>
          "I won't comment because I believe everyone is allowed to be
          delusional."
        </p>
        <p>
          She held my wrists, pulling me back towards the bed, "I hope you don't
          mind spoilers."
        </p>
        <p>"What are spoilers?"</p>
        <p>
          I found out an hour later when she told me all that would happen in
          the first episode before I had the time to actually watch it.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, it wasn't annoying. I loved listening to her talk, but three
          episodes in, I wanted to be surprised by what was happening next. I
          learned from how the main character examined his thoughts and was
          interested in seeing his story through. It was like reading a book but
          watching it happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hours fell into hours, hours where I reprimanded her, kicked her off
          the bed and decided to leave but stopped when she promised to stop
          telling me what happened before watching it, who the killer was, and
          why they killed the victim.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, I sent a message to Casmiro, telling him I would be
          running late.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, I ran late; the day turned into night, I was on the last
          episode, Zahra had left for almost an hour, brought dinner later, and
          I was still watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched until the second season started, and the person who roped me
          into it was fast asleep by my side.
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't sleep, so I kept on watching...</p>
        <p>
          I liked the show, I liked hearing her breathe beside me, and I liked
          being in the same space where Elia dwelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt wholly comfortable for the first time in a long while; all
          troubling thoughts were aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that mattered now was this. This show, this woman beside me, and
          this feeling slowly coming to life in my chest. <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p>
          <b>THE MAN </b>sitting opposite me was agitated. Flustered. Guilty of
          crimes I did not care to unearth; I only cared about the discernible
          fact that he was wasting my time. I had other pressing matters to
          attend to. But Casmiro had informed me that if it were something he
          could have overseen himself, he would have done it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat at the head of the table, the document the man had brought
          forward laid right in front of me, untouched.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo sat by the left side with a laptop. Casmiro by the right, with
          work folders requiring my attention in front of him. They were waiting
          for me to speak first, the room silent as a show of respect, but I
          remained quiet. Soldiers manned every corner in and outside the space,
          those who belonged to the stranger, Angelo, Casmiro, and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minute the man walked into the office-like space in my lounge
          area, his eyes latched on me like he was staring at a myth, like he
          had only just confirmed my existence. He still had a confident form,
          but his eyes laid bare all his weakness and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lifted my gaze to both men standing behind him, faces stoic, eyes
          forward. I looked back down at the lean man before removing the cigar
          stick from my mouth and blowing out the smoke.
        </p>
        <p>The silence was loud, palpable, filled with tension.</p>
        <p>
          Lifting both fingers that held the thick stick of my cigar, I motioned
          to his bodyguards. "Are they here to kill me?" 
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's eyes widened as he gestured for the men to find another
          place to stand. They did so promptly, and the man threw an apologetic
          smile my way. "The Marino bodyguards of the Caporegime society take
          their jobs very seriously, Mr. Marino." He informed, "They are well
          trained, skillful, and attentive. If you are ever in need of their
          services, we will have a district sent right to the headquarters,
          sir."
        </p>
        <p>"Do my soldiers look incapable of protecting me?"</p>
        <p>
          The man blinked rapidly, shaking his head. "That was not what I
          implied by my offer—"
        </p>
        <p>"Offer?"</p>
        <p>
          "I meant!" he blurted, sweat gathering between his brows. "My
          suggestion, Mr. Marino. A mere suggestion."
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept my gaze steady on him, relaxing back on the soft leader chair.
          "Do your words fail you, Armato?" I asked, bringing the cigar to my
          lips again, taking a drag, and letting out the smoke, my focus still
          on the dark-haired man with the receding hairline. "Do you perhaps
          need water or a drink, or would you prefer a cigar to help you
          function properly."
        </p>
        <p>
          The man gulped down, shifting in his seat. "I am alright, Mr. Marino."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." I nodded. "You came on behalf of the MCSS?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"As their..."</p>
        <p>"Spokesperson, sir."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "Are you usually this transparent and uncoordinated when
          you conduct business on behalf of the society."
        </p>
        <p>He cleared his throat. "Permission to speak freely, sir?"</p>
        <p>I watched him for a few seconds before nodding once.</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, sir," he sat up, straightening his suit. "Forgive my lack
          of self-conduct; it's difficult to determine how well to approach you.
          Your name is all we know, and what we have heard from different mouths
          is all we see of you. Some people in the society can never put a face
          to the name, and our messages and requests stop directly at the chain
          of Mr. Valerio. I act out of character because I am overwhelmed with
          the privilege of sitting before you, sir."
        </p>
        <p><i>I suppose I have my father to thank for that.</i></p>
        <p>
          "I see." I spoke, "You feel privileged and overwhelmed, yet you choose
          to disturb my vacation."
        </p>
        <p>
          "To which I apologize, Mr. Marino. The matter was rather pressing, and
          my boss had tried and failed to reach you directly via email."
        </p>
        <p>"He will continue to try and fail," I responded.</p>
        <p>The man's mouth fell open and then closed again.</p>
        <p>
          I sat up, pressing my cigar to the ashtray before picking up my
          glasses, putting it on, and opening the file. From my periphery, I
          caught Armato's minor surprised shifting when I did, clearly not
          expecting me to take much care in the file's contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro inched forward towards me, seat creaking under his movement as
          he did, "It contains information for the shipment—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can read." I cut him off without letting my eyes leave the pages.
        </p>
        <p>He inched backward in his seat.</p>
        <p>
          The room grew quiet as my eyes perused the pages, reading line after
          line. A clock was ticking in the background, the light vibration
          beneath my feet, as the cruise ship hummed, was extremely loud, and
          the breathing of every man in the room was careful, waiting, ceasing,
          when I frowned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If I am being correct," I turned my head towards Casmiro, "This
          shipment was the one that had been shifted due to two added
          containers?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"That should have arrived, shouldn't it?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, but it was shifted to a later date because three more containers
          were added at the last minute as the information from the MCSS
          supplied."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, looking back at the date written there. "July next year.
          That is seven months from now."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, as stated," Casmiro responded.</p>
        <p>
          My frown deepened, head turning towards Casmiro again, "Didn't you
          tell me you already signed off on it? Why do they require my
          signature?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is a huge shipment. Due to the added containers, they would need
          your signature as the overall overseer."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I see," I said, uncomfortable as I read through the last lines of the
          document to the space that required my signature.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up at the spokesperson, Armato. Eyes wide in anticipation,
          like his life was riding on the signature I was supposed to give.
        </p>
        <p>Something was wrong.</p>
        <p>
          I looked at Casmiro, "Did you confirm what contents are in these
          containers?"
        </p>
        <p>"I tried, but they told me they were not allowed to say."</p>
        <p>"And who placed that law?"</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro cleared his throat, now looking uncomfortable and confused as
          he said, "You did,"
        </p>
        <p>I turned my head towards Angelo for confirmation, and he nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "I see," I said, my gaze lifting to Armato. "The person who sent you
          to me, what position do they hold?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Armato straightened up, "Federico Gennaro, the chairman of the MCSS,
          and his right hand, a Russian associate, Leonid Novikov, and their
          whole council."
        </p>
        <p>The Russian name was not familiar, but I recognized Gennaro. </p>
        <p>"And this council consists of how many countries holding a seat?"</p>
        <p>"Ten, sir,"</p>
        <p>"It used to be five," I spoke.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes sir," Armato cleared his throat. "an invite for the election and
          addition ceremony had been sent to you to welcome the new club members
          two years ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my fault for not being well-versed in the business of the MCSS.
          I never wanted to participate in the society. They were just another
          part of my father's business I had pushed to the side when I took the
          seat—another one I would have brought to the ground eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, from what I remember, there's Italy, Russia, France, Spain, The
          United Kingdom, and?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Armato looked about ready to melt on his seat, "The United States,
          South Africa, India, North Korea, and Thailand."
        </p>
        <p>
          My frown deepened, alarm bells ringing in my head. "They breached
          Europe?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes sir, it was a huge event a lot of—"</p>
        <p>
          My head snapped towards Casmiro. "Why did this information not reach
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's jaw clenched. "You had placed strict orders about delivering
          information for the MCSS, and I did also present the issue despite
          that, but you did not acknowledge it at that time, Marino." He spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If I may," Angelo spoke up, "The MCSS is a sovereign society; though
          you oversee their affairs, they are allowed to make a decision of this
          magnitude without consulting you, as per the rules you set in place
          years ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          When my father took over from his father, he had lived and ruled by
          their standing laws, but when I was old enough to have my own
          signature, he changed everything, using my name, <i>Elio Marino</i>,
          the mastermind behind their new affairs, the man who told his father
          it would be wise to call in capos from other families, the man whom no
          one sees, the man who reformed the grand society amongst our capos,
          stringing into other caporegimes from influential families in
          neighboring European countries, as per my father's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new information was taking up a larger space in my head, and I
          did not like it. It left a bad taste on my tongue, and I most
          certainly did not have the time and the space to give it more
          attention than required.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So," I straightened my glasses, "the council needs my signature to
          allow the shipment a safe passage."
        </p>
        <p>"Exactly, sir," Armato spoke.</p>
        <p>
          The papers stated that the contents in the containers weren't in
          danger of tainting the family name, and it was tagged as 'normal
          cargo,' the same tag they've been using for decades.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, looking over at Angelo.</p>
        <p>
          "We have more pressing matters. This is MCSS business; there's not
          much we can do unless you decide to conduct a full-scale investigation
          which might take months. I overlooked the documents beforehand, and
          they are more or less the same format as their previous shipments." He
          stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at Armato, picking up my pen by the side, uncapping it,
          "Extend my message to your chairman; tell him that the next time he
          decides to interrupt my time without proper preparations, I will be
          changing a lot of rules. You should be kind to include the important
          notion that it is a threat I intend to follow."
        </p>
        <p>
          Receding hairline swallowed, straightening like a rod. "Yes, sir, I
          will do exactly that."
        </p>
        <p>
          The second I placed the pen on the paper, a small chaos at the
          entrance stopped my hand movement. I frowned, raising my head at the
          familiar voice before I saw her approaching, hair straightened and
          styled with a bang, half pulled up in a short ponytail, and half left
          down. It confirmed my realization that her hair had grown a few inches
          longer than its normal length.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wore an oversized sweater tucked upwards to showcase half of her
          stomach and waist. Her legs were covered with white, beige overside
          pants, and she wore white boots; like she was preparing to go out, a
          stylish eyewear rested perfectly atop her hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soldiers rushed after her like they were trying to stop her, but it
          was too late; she was already here.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," she grinned, looking around us as everyone on the table turned
          to look at her; soldiers around the lounge stepped forward in a move
          to contain her. "The boyband together again, No wonder these gentlemen
          didn't want me in here,"
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the soldiers moved to grab her hand, but she was quick to swing
          it from his reach, turning her gaze to his, "Touch me and lose a hand.
          I am skilled when it comes to mutilating; remember that."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, raising my hand to put them at ease.</p>
        <p>
          "What is the meaning of this?" Casmiro spoke aloud, voice laced with
          anger and irritation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra turned towards us again, approaching with a carefree grin, hips
          swaying, her confidence at its peak. "Hi Cassie, I see you're back and
          better; I did not miss seeing you healthy, just so you know." She
          said, slapping his shoulder, before raising her gaze to Angelo, "Hi,
          Angie," she acknowledged him with a smile before bright eyes settled
          on Armato, who looked confused at the change in the situation, "Hi,
          man I don't know."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now she was by my side and then behind me, her arms coming around
          my shoulder in a hug from behind, lips smacking against my cheek,
          "Hola, my pretty-eyed boyfriend who never checks his phone for text
          messages, therefore allowing me to go through the extra hassle of
          coming all the way here, interrupting his meeting, to which he cannot
          get angry at me for because I texted almost ten times, I think my
          thumb finger broke."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Boy—what?" Casmiro asked with a wide-eyed, horrified look on his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hard of hearing, Cassie? Gunshots made you deaf?" she asked, voice
          closer to my ear, perfume turning my senses to something soft.
        </p>
        <p>
          "E, what the fuck is this?" Casmiro asked, spine straight, ready to
          tackle the trouble behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a breath, dropping the pen as I removed her arms around me,
          pulling her to my side and meeting her stubborn gaze. "Can you come
          back another time? I am in the middle of—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nope, there's an away boat waiting to take us to the city; I booked
          it this morning after texting you about following me to get a tattoo
          done."
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck is happening right now." Casmiro voiced.</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," Angelo spoke up, "If you could, please read the room and
          return when Marino is—"
        </p>
        <p>"I am not canceling my plans." She stated in a firm voice.</p>
        <p>I held her wrist, "Zahra—"</p>
        <p>"I am still not canceling my plans."</p>
        <p>
          I turned to the table, "If you would...give me a moment, I apologize
          for the interruption." I said, getting to my feet and pulling her with
          me towards the small door that led to the main suite.
        </p>
        <p>"I am not apologizing."</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, but stop being a nuisance, and put yourself away; when I am
          done here, I will come to you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her brows twitched, offended. "Right, I am being a nuisance for taking
          the whole morning, planning this fucking mini stop so that we could go
          to the city together as a thank you for being kind to my friends and
          getting to know them."
        </p>
        <p>"That was—"</p>
        <p>
          "It doesn't matter; I'll go alone." She said, already turning, but I
          pulled her sharply back, seeing as my hand was still around her wrist.
          She glared at me, "Punching you in front of the people who answer to
          you will not be a good picture for your boyband yearbook. Let me go."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not disregard your efforts. You only arrived at the wrong time.
          It was a bit disrespectful on your part that you ignored—"
        </p>
        <p>"Do I look like I give a shit?"</p>
        <p>I heard Casmiro curse from behind me.</p>
        <p>
          "Por favor, Zahra, wait for me; I'll be done here in a few minutes—"
        </p>
        <p>"Twenty minutes, or I'm gone."</p>
        <p>"Thirty,"</p>
        <p>"Twenty-five."</p>
        <p>"Thirty-five."</p>
        <p>
          She groaned, gaze flicking behind me to the table, a frown on her
          neatly trimmed brows before she looked back at me. "Who's the sweaty
          guy with the receding hairline?"
        </p>
        <p>"Someone."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh no, secret stuff I can't know about." She said, voice flat as I
          let go of her wrist, "Are the cats in there?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "Fine, thirty minutes, any more, and I'm out of here, with or without
          you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," I told her as my eyes took her in again, "You look
          amazing. Brighter than usual."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pressed her lips into a thin line before widening it in a smile.
          "I know, but I mostly look brighter because I have a," Then she tilted
          her head to the side, increasing her pitch level so everyone would
          hear, "Boyfriend who is fucking me right!"
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro groaned.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra grinned. "Thirty minutes." And then she walked into my suite and
          closed the door behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little mortified, irritated, and regretful, I returned to the table
          before taking my seat.
        </p>
        <p>"I apologize again," <br /></p>
        <p>
          "Oh no," Armato laughed. "I understand; my wife gets into moods like
          that; you can never tell with our partners these days."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. Where were we?" I asked, picking up the pen, not looking at
          Casmiro because I knew he was frowning and would love nothing more but
          to bombard me with questions and unwanted opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I signed on both spaces needed, closed the file, and passed it to
          Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>"Do not forget to pass my message to your chairman, Armato."</p>
        <p>"I won't forget," he supplied with a firm nod.</p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, Angelo was escorting him out. The moment they
          were out and the soldiers around us had reduced in number, Casmiro
          attacked me with questions.
        </p>
        <p>"What the hell was that? You are in a relationship with her?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Have you gone insane?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"She's trouble."</p>
        <p>"I am aware."</p>
        <p>
          He groaned in frustration. "I am only looking out for you, E. You saw
          the ruckus she almost caused today."
        </p>
        <p>"I tamed it."</p>
        <p>"Still, you have to draw a line; what she did was unacceptable."</p>
        <p>"I will talk to her."</p>
        <p>
          "Why are you responding like you don't care about anything I'm
          saying?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I leveled him with a tired stare. "That is because you are repeating
          things I already know, <i>Hermano</i>. I appreciate your care, but you
          must also show her respect—"
        </p>
        <p>He looked offended, appalled, "Like hell I will."</p>
        <p>"She is my partner now,"</p>
        <p>"And I am still convinced she tried to fucking kill me."</p>
        <p>
          "Casmiro," I called, and he grumbled, shaking his head, not supporting
          my decision. "I won't ask you to understand. The both of you certainly
          do not like each other for reasons best known between you. I do not
          want to get involved because I care about both of you. But understand
          that she's a part of my life now, and you're also a part of my life,
          and you will have to tolerate it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked like he wanted to peel my voice off the air before it
          reached him. "What about your brother?"
        </p>
        <p>"He is learning to tolerate it."</p>
        <p>
          "God." He shook his head, remaining quiet for a few minutes before
          shaking his head again. "This is..." He trailed off, allowing another
          stretch of silence. "It's none of my business, whom you date, but I
          swear to God, one concrete evidence against her, and I'm pulling this
          whole issue of my distrust back up, alongside a permanent solution to
          it."
        </p>
        <p>"I understand."</p>
        <p>
          "Good." He said, hands going to the other files on the table, "Now
          about the other matters—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We...will have to postpone that for another time...because she's in
          there...waiting."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is work, political work, the one you roped me into, and now I am
          swimming in endless fucking minutes of meetings that I have to oversee
          and find solutions to. I am talking about areas that need
          <i>urgent </i>attention; I need your expertise."
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted towards the main apartment door before falling to
          Casmiro, "I want nothing more than to sit down and discuss politics
          with you, but that woman in there will not understand, and I—"
        </p>
        <p>He shot to his feet.</p>
        <p>"Casmiro,"</p>
        <p>
          "Let me know when you're free." He said, gathering all the papers
          without meeting my eyes, turning to leave before stopping, pinning a
          glare on the door, and then looking back at me. "Be careful."
        </p>
        <p>"I will."</p>
        <p>
          With a shake of his head and much hesitation, he made his way out of
          the lounge area.
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed a breath fall through my lips as I looked back at the door.
        </p>
        <p><i>"I am still convinced she tried to fucking kill me."</i></p>
        <p>
          Casmiro's voice replayed in my head, but I suppressed it. Suppressed
          his worry, buried the tight feeling in my gut.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I am wrong. My gut is wrong this time. My mind has compromised my
            gut, and my mind is unstable, so there is a twelve percent chance
            that I am wrong.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>I held on to that twelve percent. I held on to it tight.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "Sorry about the cheap car rental," Zahra said from the driver's seat
          of the Toyota 2010 Camry, one hand on the steering wheel and the other
          on a cup of coffee we had stopped to get while we waited for the car.
          She didn't accept my offer to pay for anything, so I let her handle it
          because it was causing another argument I didn't want to entertain.
          "STREET and I exhausted a lot of money with the suite and the other
          cruise expenses."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't respond; my focus was on my phone as I responded to Gemma's
          text with a frown.

          I knew of her liken to Angelo, but I didn't know Angelo would
          entertain nor reciprocate it. I have never cared about his romantic
          life; I only knew he never brought it into the business. I trusted him
          not to be careless with her, but his schedule was hectic and would not
          end well for either of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention Casmiro, his focus would be deterred because, unlike
          me, he cared about Angelo's dating life and would become even more
          grumpy than he already was.

        <p>"Who are you texting?"</p>
        <p>
          I raised my head to catch her glancing at my phone and then me, before
          she focused on the road again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Someone," I responded, looking back at the screen and shooting off a
          last message.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b></p>
        <p><b>We will continue this conversation when I return. </b></p>
        <p>I pressed the side button and focused on Zahra.</p>
        <p>"You were saying?"</p>
        <p>
          She shrugged. "Never mind," she pulled in by the side of a tattoo and
          piercing store, which looked like a scene I would never entertain. "We
          are here!"
        </p>
        <p>"Why, if I may ask, do you need a tattoo?"</p>
        <p>
          She turned off the engine, turning to look at me. "I already told you,
          but you didn't hear...texting and all, come on, I'll explain while
          we're in there."
        </p>
        <p>
          The store wasn't too small or large; the music surrounding the area
          disturbed my ear. Sounds of tattoo pins on skin came from behind a
          door by the left.
        </p>
        <p>I wouldn't say I liked the environment, but I kept quiet.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra walked to the little reception, which held a woman with a
          buzzcut with piercings on her lips, nose, and brows; tattoos littered
          her skin. "Sup, Tatty," Zahra greeted with a grin, "Been a while!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tatty responded with a surprisingly calm smile, "Zahra, I'm
          shocked; what has it been—a year?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Business these days, got myself in a bit of a situation that had me
          off the grid for months now, crazy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Tatty's eyes shifted to me, "Oh, I see; who's the beauty glaring at
          us?"
        </p>
        <p>I was not glaring.</p>
        <p>
          "He's with me, and trust me, that is not a glare," Zahra said,
          glancing briefly at me. "Where's Julio?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A door opened by the side, and a big tatted man emerged with a big
          grin on his face, "Zahra, Mi Amor,"
        </p>
        <p>She turned, and beamed...<i>beamed.</i></p>
        <p>"Julio, my baby, I've missed you!"</p>
        <p>And then they were hugging.</p>
        <p>Right there, a few feet away from me.</p>
        <p>I had suddenly become invisible.</p>
        <p>
          The man looked to be in his late twenties; his face said that, but it
          was apparent that he visited the gym frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          They pulled apart, and the man's eyes took her in before settling on
          her chest, raising his hands in an attempt to touch her, "How are
          these beauties—"
        </p>
        <p>
          My feet moved, and my hand grabbed the man's wrist before it could
          meet her chest; I squeezed the hold, aiming to shatter his bones
          beyond repair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nng—Ow, ow, ow, Amigo!" The man screeched, body bending with my hold,
          trying to stop me from breaking his wrist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra's gasp reached my ears as she held my arm, trying to ease off my
          hold, "Elio, what the fuck? Let go of him,"
        </p>
        <p>
          My stare burned into his, "Do you just touch women without their
          permission?"
        </p>
        <p>"What the—no, I was trying to check—"</p>
        <p>"Check what?"</p>
        <p>"To see—ah!"</p>
        <p>
          "Jesus, Elio, let him go! He's Julio; remember the guy I told you
          about, the one who did my piercings?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My grip tightened, and the man folded, dancing on his feet in pain,
          one that reflected on his face.
        </p>
        <p>"You do not touch her," I told him.</p>
        <p>"I won't. I won't!"</p>
        <p>
          "That sounds like a promise made out of fear, affirm to me that you
          will not touch her again, and if you do, I am allowed to break your
          wrist and subject you to a life where you will run at the sight of a
          tattoo pin or any pin in general because not only will I break your
          wrist I will <i>break you.</i> Affirm to me."
        </p>
        <p>"I affirm, no touch, no touch your angel, at all."</p>
        <p>I let him go.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra let out a breath, shooting a frown my way as she said,
          "You...God—" stopped, her voice tight as she turned to Julio with an
          apologetic look, "Julio, I am so sorry,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no apologies," the man couldn't meet my gaze, "I...I didn't know
          you now have a...spouse."
        </p>
        <p>Zahra sighed. "Yeah, uh...can bring out the design catalog?"</p>
        <p>
          "Of course," the man rushed out, looking at me, "I am sorry again,
          Mister."
        </p>
        <p>And then he disappeared through the door he had come out of.</p>
        <p>Zahra turned sharply to me, "That was—"</p>
        <p>"We are leaving."</p>
        <p>
          "No, we are not." She fought back. "This place was second to home for
          me; I worked here for a few weeks, and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not care, Zahra. We <i>are</i> leaving and finding somewhere
          else."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No." a glare, accompanied by irritation, flared in her eyes as she
          crossed her arms against her chest, her guard raising. "There's
          nothing wrong with this place, and you have no <i>fucking</i> right to
          tell me what to and what not to <i>fucking</i> do,"
        </p>
        <p>"You were just going to let him touch you? Right in front of me?"</p>
        <p>"It's norm—"</p>
        <p>
          "Even if you weren't in front of me, you would have let him touch
          you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She sighed, "It's how we are, we—we're friends; I mean, he's seen all
          there is to see about my fucking titties, and I was here frequently
          during that time—"
        </p>
        <p>"Did you hear what I just asked?"</p>
        <p>
          "I did. And I'm telling you, it wouldn't have offended me if he had
          touched me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at her, utterly dumbfounded, my anger eating away at my
          resolve. The fact that she even saw the need to argue with me on this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am standing right here, and you are also standing right here,
          telling me you would have not been offended if another man had touched
          you that way, right in front of me, right in front of the person you
          are supposedly dating, the person you are supposedly in a committed
          relationship with."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mouth opened, closed, opened again, "I mean...when you put it like
          that—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know you don't like me on a large scale, and we have our many
          disagreements, but a little regard and a little respect would be
          highly appreciated."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are right," she blurted begrudgingly. "It's just, I'm used to
          that kind of familiarity with Julio, and I didn't think it would
          offend you because it never used to...offend me, and sometimes I don't
          think about the, you know...committed relationship thing. It will take
          some getting used to, but I realize how this could have looked." She
          cleared her throat, "Sorry, it won't happen again. No more letting men
          grope my boobies because now I have a big bad psycho boyfriend who
          owns my boobies...does the commitment include that? You owning my
          boobies?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stop saying...<i>boobies</i>." I grounded out, knowing she was trying
          to make light of the issue, but I was still angry, still disturbed by
          what I had just witnessed and what she had tried to defend.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right," she shot me a sly smile, "sticking to titties...or my big
          roundish chest balls? Fleshy oranges? Chest growth? Uh...fluffy bosom
          filled up circles? Tropical chest coconuts? heavenly—"
        </p>
        <p>"Stop, just—stop," I rubbed my eyes. "Where are the car keys."</p>
        <p>Her smile faltered. "What for?"</p>
        <p>"I will wait in there until you're finished here."</p>
        <p>Her face fell, "Why?"</p>
        <p>"The car keys, Zahra,"</p>
        <p>"It's not that deep; I already apologized—"</p>
        <p>
          "I would <i>hate</i> to argue in front of an audience," I looked over
          at the Tatty woman, who did not bother to hide that she was looking
          and listening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back at Zahra, I outstretched my hand. She sighed, checking
          her small bag for the keys; when she found it, she dropped it against
          my palm.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          I was already walking away from her and out of the shop, itching with
          a need to project my anger, the jealousy twisting my gut, and her
          blatant ignorance regarding what that man wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          They might have been friends who groped each other—<i
            >if there was a friendship of that sort</i
          >—but she had <i>me</i> now; it should have gone without saying that
          there was a fucking limit we both couldn't cross with other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or maybe she saw no need for that limit because whatever this was,
          wasn't serious for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overbearing and controlling was the last thing I wanted to be. Those
          traits ticked off her alarm bells; I saw it in how she had locked her
          shoulders when I told her we were leaving; I knew she would bite off
          my finger instead of allowing me the space to demand we leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't blind to the privileges she had given me, the little trust
          she had let in, and I did not intend to misuse it. So I had to leave
          that space to contain myself because acting on my primal thoughts
          would have resulted in something more serious.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not want my anger to take away the little trust we seemed to
          have built. Or to supply her the notion that I was exhibiting traits
          like the other men who had fed off the control they had on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was apparent that, like her, I was as clueless as they came when it
          came to relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, breathing in fresh air, before I got into the car, grabbed
          my phone, and placed a call to Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>It rang three times before he picked up.</p>
        <p><i>"Marino."</i></p>
        <p>
          "Do you recall that time I told you that if I needed relationship
          advice, I would come to you?"
        </p>
        <p><i>"Uh...yeah?" </i></p>
        <p>
          "Good, now is that time," I told him. "I need relationship advice."

        <p><i>What did you think of this chapter?</i></p>
        <p>
          In Elio or Zahra's perspective with their mini argument, who do you
          think is right, and deserves an apology?
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you think Elio should have signed those papers? what do you think
          is inside those containers?

        <p>
          <b>"MEN, AM </b>I right?" I raised my hands, dropping them with a
          tight smile as I approached the counter, where Tatty shot me a knowing
          stare that made me slump my shoulders and groan in exasperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When I realized you both were together, <i>together</i>, I regretted
          not having popcorn to see Julio get beat up." She admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite my worry, a smile tainted my lips. "Me too...kind of. But
          that's me and Julio, Tatty. That's how we play."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Letting him touch your tits in front of a man who gives
          <i>I can squash you till you're dust energy?</i> Yeah, no, you were
          playing with Julio's life at that point. Besides, you've got yourself
          a man now; you can't be letting Julio touch you like that anymore, not
          to talk in front of your man; that's not cool."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, probably, but you don't know Elio, okay? He's—I mean, he can be
          a little extra sometimes, and it's not like I knew he would get
          offended. Besides he ignored me thought out the ride here, and you
          don't see me being a bitch about it, in fact, I didn't care, why?
          Because I am mature and I will not be that person, I'm bigger than
          that."
        </p>
        <p>Tatty laughed, shaking her head, "I did not miss that attitude."</p>
        <p>
          I grinned, "I know you love me, everyone loves me, they just like to
          pretend they don't love me, but I know they do, I am very lovable."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her stare gave, 'Really?' as she snorted and said, "Okay, Zahra." she
          shook her head. "How did it go with that Devil kid, though? You guys
          still roll?" she asked, assembling different pins to racks.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, Elio's his brother."</p>
        <p>She stopped. "You're dating the brother of your fuck buddy?"</p>
        <p>"Yup—well, Devil's not my fuck buddy anymore, we ended it."</p>
        <p>"So, you moved on with his brother."</p>
        <p>I shrugged, "I mean, you've seen his brother."</p>
        <p>
          "I <i>have</i> seen his brother, and I see why, but girl, you move
          fast."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, God—he's gone," Julio's voice came out cautiously from behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned with a sly smirk. "And you scream like a girl, what have I
          taught you, Julio."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shush," He placed ice on his wrist, cautiously stepping out from
          behind the door, looking around like Elio would automatically pop up
          with a gun to finish him off. "A little heads up would have been nice,
          where the fuck did you find him anyway?"
        </p>
        <p>"Brother of the fuck buddy," Tatty supplied with a smirk.</p>
        <p>
          Julio turned his head to look at me, staring blankly, the catalog
          tucked under his arm, "Why am I even surprised? Only you would pull
          something like that; family dinner must be eventful."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ha," I chortled and grabbed the catalog when he turned his shoulder,
          gesturing for me to take it, seeing as he was busy icing his bruised
          wrist, "No family dinners yet, hopefully soon, I'll get popcorn,
          record the whole thing and send it to you," I said, opening the
          catalog.
        </p>
        <p>"What does he do?" Julio asked, leaning on the counter.</p>
        <p>"Ehh...politics, inside politics, business shit."</p>
        <p>
          When I noticed their quietness, I looked up and between both of them
          before adding, "You know those serious people shit that helps the
          nation?"
        </p>
        <p>Julio nodded.</p>
        <p>"Yeah, that's what he does."</p>
        <p>
          "Must be loaded," Tatty said, leaning against the counter while I
          looked back at the catalog in my hand, flipping pages after pages of
          the designs.
        </p>
        <p>"He is," I agreed. "hit the jackpot on that one."</p>
        <p>
          Julio made a mocking laugh sound, "Not like it's any use for you."
        </p>
        <p>Smiling, I nodded, "You know me so well."</p>
        <p>"That gloved hand friend of yours, was here," Tatty said.</p>
        <p>"Vitale?" I asked, my eyes not leaving the catalog.</p>
        <p>
          "Yup, the hot creepy fucker." Tatty said, "Said he knew you would drop
          by here because you were around the area, and to give you a message."
        </p>
        <p>I looked up, my attention grabbed. "What message?"</p>
        <p>
          "<i>Bells are ringing</i>." Julio answered, "he said to tell you that,
          word for word."
        </p>
        <p>"What is that about?" Tatty asked.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed, my annoyance spiking by the second, as I offered my clueless
          friends a tight smile. "He writes nursery rhymes, and well—loves to
          drop hints of the new shit he's working on here and there. I'm pretty
          sure he dropped one for Layla because he knows I eat at her family's
          restaurant whenever I'm down here."
        </p>
        <p>"Creep," Tatty muttered.</p>
        <p>
          "You can't blame him; he was dropped too many times as a kid and got
          so many issues because of it. In fact, give me a sec; I'll call him to
          let him know that I got his message," I smiled, pulling out my phone
          from my purse as I moved to another direction in the reception area,
          placing a call to the fucking bone in my throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          He answered on the third ring,
          <i>"I see your friends delivered my message." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Vitale, what is your problem? Ambushing my friends, ambushing me?
          <i>Threatening me?</i>"
        </p>
        <p><i>"It all got you to call me, didn't it?" </i></p>
        <p>I rubbed my eyes, "Where the fuck are you?"</p>
        <p><i>"Sicily."</i></p>
        <p>
          "Great, stay there, and don't call or come here until I ask you to."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Are you telling me what to do?" </i></p>
        <p>"That's exactly what I'm doing."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"You wouldn't even ask me why I left to Sicily quicker than
            intended?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"No, because I don't care, and because I really wanted you gone."</p>
        <p><i>"Ask me." </i></p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, letting out a controlled breath. "Vitale, I don't
          have time for this."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Ask me." </i></p>
        <p>
          "Fine! What happened to you, sweetheart, why did you leave early? I
          really wanted to spend time with you, it's so unfortunate, but please
          tell me why you left, I really wanna know so bad because this aching
          in my chest I can't—I can't control it, I just need to know why you
          left because I don't think I'll survive if you don't fucking tell me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Without seeing him, I knew he was smiling. I rolled my eyes so hard it
          hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard him clear his throat,
          <i
            >"Well, your uh—recent bed-buddy asked me to leave. He didn't come
            to me, but he had people come to me. They threw around threats here
            and there, gave me hours...a head start."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my brows. "Oh, that's expected. I'm surprised he didn't kill
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Yeah, me too. But I am intrigued, you know me, I love a good
            drama," </i
          >his voice drawled<i
            >. "I love playing in it. Especially when I know my role is one I
            would win at. I know what's coming so...this will be interesting."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anger sliced against my chest as I took the phone from my ear, my
          upper lip raising in a snare before I closed my eyes, gritted my
          teeth, and let out a steady breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opening my eyes again, I pressed the phone back to my ear. "Marino has
          nothing to do with this,"
        </p>
        <p><i>"Yeah, keep telling yourself that, Faizan." </i></p>
        <p>"Stay <i>away</i> from him,"</p>
        <p>I heard him give a wistful sigh.</p>
        <p>
          "I fucking mean it, Vitale. You fuck with him. Then you fuck with me;
          there's no going around it."
        </p>
        <p>He scoffed, then said, <i>"I'll be seeing you soon, Zahra."</i></p>
        <p>The call disconnected.</p>
        <p>
          I squeezed my phone as I brought it from my ear, "Fuck." I muttered,
          pressing against my nose bridge. I wanted to hit something so bad,
          something that looked and smelled and talked and walked like Vitale
          fucking Conti. Schooling my features, I turned back to Tatty and
          Julio, "What did I say?" I walked towards them. "He was so eager to
          talk about his new addition to his upcoming album."
        </p>
        <p>"That I understand, but what's up with the gloves?"</p>
        <p>
          "Every man in their family wears gloves, don't even get me started on
          it. It's like some occultic tradition they can't talk about. Crazy."
          And that was the truth. Vitale always wore gloves like Martino, their
          fathers, brothers, cousins, uncles, and nephews.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Conti's were a fucking weird society I didn't want to get involved
          with. I had no reason to bother them as long as they didn't bother me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let's see...I need a shoulder tattoo, something small but symbolic."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shoulder?" Julio asked, surprised. "That's too innocent for you."
        </p>
        <p>"Trust me, I know. But I gotta cover a gunshot wound."</p>
        <p>
          Tatty gasped, eyes wide, with surprise lacing her voice. "Gunshot?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yup."</p>
        <p>"You got shot?" Julio echoed.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, I did; it wasn't pretty," I said, eyes centering on a
          heart-shaped design.
        </p>
        <p>"Who shot you?"</p>
        <p>
          "The same person who almost broke your wrist," I told them—dropping
          the catalog on the table, turning my head to an angle to see the shape
          of the design forming an 'E.' I smirked to myself, finger-pointing at
          the heart-shaped design. "This one, I want this one, but with my
          taste."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Girl, did you just say that the man who left here was the one that
          shot you?" Tatty asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, it's nothing to worry about though, his hands slip sometimes." I
          clarified, looking up at Julio, "Can we do this? We won't finish
          closing up the heart; we'll stop the curve at this point," I indicated
          with my finger, "And then from this other bit, it's going to have like
          a thunder shape design, but...one that looks like the letter 'M'?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He blinked his focus back, clearly not getting over the fact that Elio
          shot me, and we weren't all freaking out about it. That's history at
          this point. They probably understood that our relationship wasn't all
          sunshine and rainbows from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uh...I can picture what you're saying, but maybe draw it out so we'll
          get the full picture?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Tatty provided paper and a pen, and I carefully drew it out how I
          wanted it to look. "There, but with more expertise."
        </p>
        <p>"Got it; I'll assign someone to you."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          My mind wandered in different directions as the tattoo artist assigned
          to me was applying the finishing touches to her work. The pain from
          the pin was dull. I felt it, but my mind couldn't comprehend it. Not
          when I was too busy trying to understand how the fuck everything had
          gotten so serious so fast, how I had reached the finish line of this
          whole thing after starting the race without a heart or an attachment
          to anyone or anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the past few years had impacted my life the way I never thought it
          would, and I was swimming with a boat load of denial, guilt, regret
          and anger—heart stopping, nerve wreaking anger at the fact that I had
          to do any of this at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped myself from sighing yet again because the woman doing the
          work had been noticing it. I didn't want her to think I needed a good
          talk or something—which I did—but I wasn't about to rant to a total
          stranger, one that might have just started working here because I
          didn't recognize her, but Julio had assured me that there was magic in
          her hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ugh—I had to stop thinking about this; self-pity, the unnecessary
          anger, or my constant double thinking about this shit wouldn't stop or
          change anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing footsteps approaching, I turned my head towards the door to
          the room only occupied by me and some old guy who was getting his
          whole back inked with headphones in his ear. The door opened, and my
          eyes widened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio walked in, his eyes finding me instantly while he closed the door
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some warm and fluffy and ugh feeling swirled around my chest at the
          sight of him. <i>He came back</i>. I didn't know why, but all that
          mattered was that he did. Maybe that was his way of showing me he
          wasn't mad to the point that he didn't want to be near me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was careful not to move even though I had the urge to. "Hey." I
          smiled, but he didn't come over; he just settled on the visitor's
          couch next to a kid of about 11, whom I supposed belonged to the old
          guy.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm," he responded.</p>
        <p>"Why did you leave the car?" I swallowed. "Did something happen?"</p>
        <p>
          He was looking around the environment, displeasure in those sharp
          eyes. "No. It was too quiet," he said before his gaze shifted to me.
          "When will you be finished?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just a couple of minutes," I answered, my gaze lingering on him
          cautiously, trying to see if he still carried the anger he had left
          with, but his eyes gave nothing away, and his form was completely
          neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          And me, I was utterly overwhelmed, extremely comfortable, and weirdly
          happy that he was sitting there waiting for me, so dedicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kid beside him had stopped playing on the phone that he held; his
          head was raised towards Elio, jaw dropped, eyes wide in awe, like he
          was looking at something extraordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio noticed, too, because he looked away from me to the kid by his
          side. He raised a brow as if to ask why the kid was looking at him.
        </p>
        <p>"You are so...huge." The little boy said.</p>
        <p>Elio's frown grew very slowly, morphing into a glare.</p>
        <p>I pressed my lips together, trying to suppress a laugh.</p>
        <p>"Do you just make comments like that—"</p>
        <p>
          "Elio!" I yelled, grabbing his attention and making him look at me.
          "He's just a kid, Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>"A kid that does not know how to control his tongue."</p>
        <p>
          "I know how to control my tongue." The kid bit back, sticking his
          tongue out to Elio, who inched back, looking seconds away from
          flicking the kid on the forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When will you be finished here?" Elio asked again, irritation lacing
          his voice.
        </p>
        <p>"Just chill, okay?"</p>
        <p>
          "I am <i>chill</i>. I would not be here if I were not <i>chill</i>."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, got it; I won't ask you to <i>chill</i> again."</p>
        <p>Now the irritation in his eyes was directed at me.</p>
        <p>
          He whipped out his phone and looked at the screen, which marked the
          end of the conversation; his eyes didn't leave the device until I was
          done and checking out the work in a mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was red, a little swollen, shiny but very neat, and simple, nothing
          extra.
        </p>
        <p>
          I covered it as I approached Elio with a silly grin on my face; he was
          already on his feet, looking relieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now," I started, "I want to tilt your head to this angle," I showed
          him, using myself as an example. "While you look at it."
        </p>
        <p>He blinked at me, unamused. "Okay. I have no idea why you would—"</p>
        <p>I removed my hand, and he stopped talking.</p>
        <p>
          A frown dragged his brows down, but then he tilted his head to the
          angle I had asked him to, his gaze taking in the tattoo, and the frown
          slowly—ever so slowly, eased out of his brows, his lips parting, eyes
          softening, before heavy eyes rose slowly to mine, locking, staying and
          searching, while it made my grin slowly falter.
        </p>
        <p>He looked...sad, appalled, terrified.</p>
        <p>
          "Why would you do this?" His voice was soft, almost breathless like it
          took everything in him to utter that one question.
        </p>
        <p>I blinked. "Why wouldn't I?"</p>
        <p>
          "Those are—why would you tattoo my—my—my initials to yourself?
          <i>To your body? </i> Why would you do such a thing? You know this
          won't—you know this is permanent, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah? I mean, I could just draw a skull over it if I get tired of
          it?" my gaze searched his as concern and confusion fucked with my
          head. "What's—what's happening right now? Why are you freaking out
          over this? It's not like it's a confession of my undying love or
          something; I have a reason for making this one?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What could compel—" He stopped, looked around us, and then back at
          me. "Can we go to the car? I don't feel comfortable discussing this
          here."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, and we left the room after a brief thank you to the lady who
          looked like she was responsible for Elio's sudden change of mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bid a quick farewell to all familiar faces while rushing out with
          Elio right ahead of me; he opened the car door for me, meaning he was
          going to be the one to drive this time, I didn't comment on it as I
          got in, and he rounded the car, getting in too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second he locked the door beside him, his eyes latched on mine.
          "Why?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Remember your gun? The one I took from you? It had your
          initials, and well, you were the one who shot me with your bullet, so
          I tattooed your initials to the spot that you shot me, but as you can
          see," I shifted my sweater to the side, "at first glance, it just
          looks like a heart shape and a letter M, but with like a thunder kinda
          font? So no one except you and me would get the concept unless,
          well—they turn their head that way..."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "You know the concept. That's my problem. You
          shouldn't have done this—you should have picked something else."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Should I have tattooed a huge eggplant? Would you have loved that?" I
          snapped.
        </p>
        <p>"No, it's—"</p>
        <p>
          "Forget the fact that it's your initials; this was my choice, the only
          thing that it has to do with you is the fucking initials and the fact
          that you were the one who shot me there."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          The groan that left my throat cut him off, "What is the big deal, for
          fucks sake? I was so excited about this! It's the beginning of my
          tattoo era; I should be downing it with shots or something."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It <i>is</i> a big deal," his voice was hard, same as his stare. "it
          will be a big deal when you look at it in the mirror every fucking
          day, and it reminds you of me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I angled myself properly so my body was facing his, "<i>How</i> is
          that such a bad thing?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, hand going to mess up his hair, "Zahra, tattoos are
          meant to be monumental; they're meant to mean something to you because
          they <i>stay</i>, okay? They don't leave your skin or fade away;
          they're supposed to be something you look at and—feel something good
          or bad, depending on what they're there for. They're supposed to be
          meaningful."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay?" I said softly, seeing where he was coming from. "You think you
          don't mean anything to me?" I asked, and his gaze fell from mine to
          the console. "You think I spend time or money on someone that means
          nothing to me? Do you think I'd even tattoo your fucking initials on
          my skin if I didn't like you so much it annoys the fucking sanity out
          of me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He made some strained, uncomfortable noise that had me backing my
          statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, half of these things that I do with you, I've never done them
          with somebody else, I have never felt like this for anyone in my
          entire fucking miserable life, and sometimes I just look at myself and
          wonder if I'm still the same Zahra who left Sicily years ago. That's
          how much you affect me, you idiot, so yes, I tattooed your initials on
          my skin, and I love it; it's pretty, they're really fucking strong
          initials, and I'm wearing it proud—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And it's going to stay there," his gaze locked with mine. "it's going
          to be there, and I—what if I'm not here, Zahra." his eyes gaze worked,
          looking between mine, finding my response.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't understand. Do you plan on going somewhere?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked frustrated now, brows twitching between a frown and defeat
          before his unsure gaze fell back to the console, his lips a little
          downturned, eyes worried, his free hand clenching and unclenching on
          his thigh, which housed a leg that was now bouncing rapidly on his
          seat.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio," I called.</p>
        <p>He shook his head. "I apologize, but this is—"</p>
        <p>"Just a tattoo."</p>
        <p>
          He looked at me again, almost helpless, as he took my hand. "My head,"
          he looked into my eyes like he was trying to plaster his words to my
          brain. "My head is all tons of crazy right now, Zahra. That—that
          little tattoo on your shoulder is ruining the reason why I drew this
          tattoo all over my body. You're undoing the only thing that I was
          living for."
        </p>
        <p>"And that is what? Huh? to kill yourself?"</p>
        <p>"No. To fix this. To bring balance."</p>
        <p>I leveled him with a glare. "A balance that involves you dying."</p>
        <p>"You won't understand."</p>
        <p>
          The scoff that left me was bitter. "I don't want to be that person,
          but do you think you're the only one who's had it tough? People suffer
          worse shit, and they don't want to fucking off themselves, and you're
          here blaming yourself for what happened to your family; that's sick,
          Elio because it's not even your fault! Do you think this is what they
          would have wanted? You think that's what your mom would have wanted?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes! This is what she wants. She told me—" he stopped. A bit of color
          drained from his face. Shock ruled his eyes at what he had just said.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "No, forget I said anything." His voice was precise, clipped. He
          looked away from me; his leg stopped bouncing, his hands stopped
          shaking. His eyes stopped looking confused; his openness was gone.
          Now, all I saw was the blank wall he used to be. It was like his brain
          had turned, and he had just flicked on a reset button. "The tattoo
          caught me off guard. I did not think you would choose that kind of
          design. It is beautiful, nonetheless."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, unsure of what just happened. "I can't just forget what
          happened; you were saying something about—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I did not know what I was saying." He started the engine of the car.
          "It has been a stressful day; I think we should get food from that
          place you mentioned earlier; I can not remember the name, but if you
          would—"
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand covered his on the steering wheel, "Elio." I called, bringing
          his hand to me while I placed my hand on the other side of his face,
          turning his head so he could look at me. "You can tell me anything." I
          said, our gazes unwavering, "All jokes aside, all threats aside, I am
          here to listen to whatever—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not have anything to say. And stop looking at me like that. I am
          fine. I am not crazy."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head quickly. "I didn't say that. At all."</p>
        <p>"Then stop looking at me like that; I don't like it."</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, I just—" I blew out a breath. "Listen, if I had known the
          tattoo would affect you this way, I wouldn't have put it. I would have
          done something else."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "It is okay. I understand. As I said, it is a
          beautiful tattoo. I panicked for nothing. I am not used to this, so it
          is most likely normal that you do this, and it is okay. It is your
          body, and you can choose to do whatever you want to it. I will only
          support you and offer my opinions if needed."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like how he spoke, calculating his words before he said them.
        </p>
        <p>"I—"</p>
        <p>
          "And please, remove your notion about me wanting to hurt myself. I do
          not, and I will not. I have too much to lose if I die now. So you do
          not have to worry; that was not what I implied."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, knowing there was only pushing this if I took another route
          to make him bring that topic back. I didn't want to share
          <i>that</i> right now, so I let it slide.
        </p>
        <p>"Okay," I said.</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He responded, detaching his hand from mine. "Now, where is that
          restaurant of yours?"
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          We had ordered Paella—No—I had ordered Paella, Elio just ordered what
          I ordered, and I wasn't sure he liked it. It was fully garnished with
          prawns, beef, and calamari, and the rice was incredibly delicious. It
          was their special of the day, so I did not doubt that it was good.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I took the first spoonful, I almost forgot why there was a bit of
          tension between me and the man sitting opposite me in our booth. I was
          enjoying the meal, but then I looked up and realized he was picking at
          his food.
        </p>
        <p>"You don't like it?"</p>
        <p>He looked up at me immediately. "I do."</p>
        <p>"Then eat it."</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the plate in front of him before settling his gaze on me
          again. "I like it, but I don't eat that much."
        </p>
        <p>I scoffed. "Now that's a lie."</p>
        <p>He raised a brow at me, "What makes you think it's a lie."</p>
        <p>
          I pinned him with a blank stare. "Seriously? All this coming from the
          guy who ate almost all the food in the fucking bowl I provided right
          after he fucked me in a tub." I said. "Or do we have to have sex
          before you eat like you did that day?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He tilted his head like he was thinking about it. "Are you suggesting?
          Because if you are, I would love to try that method."
        </p>
        <p>
          A laugh bubbled from my chest and out of my mouth. "Oh my God, Elio, I
          can never figure you out, can I?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The side of his lips lifted a bit. "I was only considering what you
          said; besides, I think I ate that much because we were eating
          together."
        </p>
        <p>"We <i>are</i> eating together now."</p>
        <p>
          "I meant from the same plate or bowl, rather. Also, I do not really
          like...prawns."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "So why did you order Paella with Prawns?"</p>
        <p>"Because you ordered it." He stated.</p>
        <p>"You could have just ordered something else."</p>
        <p>
          "I couldn't see anything that was written in the menu. The font didn't
          agree with my poor vision, so I could not place the words. It made it
          difficult to read, and I did notbring my glasses."
        </p>
        <p>Something softened in my chest.</p>
        <p>"So why didn't you ask for help?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked down at the food, using the spoon to push away the prawn
          closest to it. "We were not talking."
        </p>
        <p><i>Jesus, this man. </i></p>
        <p>
          I was convinced he was doing this shit on purpose. There was no
          fucking way. No fucking way he was making me feel like this by just
          being so fucking...ugh, adorable. Like a big baby.
          <i>My big baby</i>...I really did hit the jackpot on this one, didn't
          I?
        </p>
        <p>
          One minute he's like the most manliest man ever to exist, and the
          next, he's—<i>such a kid. </i>
        </p>
        <p>A spoiled kid.</p>
        <p>I shook my head, dropping my spoon and getting to my feet.</p>
        <p>
          "What are you doing?" He asked with a clueless frown as I rounded the
          table and came to his booth.
        </p>
        <p>"Scoot,"</p>
        <p>
          His frown remained while he shifted, and I took the space beside him.
          I picked my plate from the other side of the table and brought it to
          our side before pouring my food into his plate, dropping the empty
          plate beside the too-filled one and selecting the prawns into the
          empty one.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We'll eat from the same plate, no prawns, no excuse," I said, knowing
          his eyes were on me, a piercing stare that made my stomach jump, one
          that made my heart thump, and compelled my eyes to meet his.
        </p>
        <p>
          His stare held an emotion I couldn't even begin to understand if I
          tried.
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed. "Wha—"</p>
        <p>
          He leaned in, pressed his lips to mine, and gave my existence a two
          seconds glitch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soft and familiar lips lingered on mine, made me melt a little, had me
          weak, anddrove me to a place where all the little issues we had since
          we left the cruise meant nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lingered a bit and then pulled away. I opened my eyes when he
          pulled his open.
        </p>
        <p>"You want to know something?" he asked.</p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          Elio worried his bottom lip with his teeth, eyes flickering between my
          eyes and my lips. "I think...I think I <i>really</i><i> </i> like you,
          Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn't the first time he'd said it, but—this time, it felt like
          he meant it more than the last time he said it.
        </p>
        <p>I smiled, "I think I really like you too, Elio."</p>
        <p>He returned my smile, his voice low. "Repeating my words?"</p>
        <p>"You kissed mine out of me; your fault."</p>
        <p>
          He placed his hand underneath my chin and raised my head. "I am sorry
          if I offended you today by leaving the tattoo shop. And also with our
          conversation in the car about the tattoo. I really do think it's a
          beautiful tattoo, and I'm flattered."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know it was possible for someone's heart to swell. But it
          felt like mine was swelling; I loved his compliments, though I liked
          to pretend I didn't, but I sought it. It was why I took extra care
          with my outfits today, applied a little bit of eyeliner and lip gloss,
          found my favorite sweater, and fussed about what to do with my hair.
        </p>
        <p>It was why I was doing things that I would typically not do.</p>
        <p>
          "It's okay. I'm not mad. I should be the one apologizing for Julio
          and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You already apologized. I am not angry either. What I have with you
          beats that, right? It beats everything. These feelings, they're new
          for you too? Like you said in the car?"
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Yeah."</p>
        <p>
          "Then I have nothing to worry about. You are an exception for me, as
          you've implied that I am, too, for you."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Yeah."</p>
        <p>
          He kissed me again, and I sank into it. His body called to mine, and I
          answered with my heart and my body...but my mind...
        </p>
        <p>My mind was speaking a different language.</p>
        <p>
          I was digging an even bigger hole for myself. I had fallen into this
          hole, but for some reason, I was still digging, falling deeper into my
          own pit, but it didn't matter...the space around me felt good; it felt
          different, and I felt free.
        </p>
        <p>But for how long?</p>
        <p><i>How long can I keep digging? </i></p>

        <p>
          <b>I COULD </b>feel eyes on me. Watching and waiting. Trying to
          listen, decipher, and decode me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The annoyance that swirled inside me and the urge to turn and meet the
          person's gaze was strong. Still, I held firm, twirling the wine glass
          in my grip softly, as the transparent white scarf I tied over the
          bikini thong I wore blew this way and that with the evening breeze,
          the same as the unbuttoned, almost translucent white flannel shirt
          over my bikini bra.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd tied my hair into two scattered buns on my head so that nothing
          would touch my skin; maybe that was why I felt the stalker's stern
          gaze on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I'll let you know," I said to the person at the other end of
          the line before taking the phone from my ear and ending the call. I
          slipped the device into the breast pocket of the flannel shirt and
          brought the wine glass to my lips as I turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wind hit me, and the view from the ocean, housing the setting sun,
          had me feeling lighthearted until my gaze settled on the person
          staring at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed an easy smile to stretch against my lips as I watched him
          casually standing there, one hand inside his pants pocket, not even
          hiding the fact that he was suspiciously looking.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sigh, I made my way towards him near the railing, a dangerous
          place to stand with the one person who had taken a dislike to me upon
          first glance. People were here and there, though, soaking up the
          evening sun and enjoying the last hours on board.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I reached him, I gave a toothy grin, and he frowned. "Casmiro!" I
          hailed, "It's a little pathetic that you choose to spend the last day
          of the cruise stalking me."
        </p>
        <p>"Who were you on the phone with?"</p>
        <p>
          I scoffed out a laugh. "My lawyer, we were discussing putting a
          restraining order on your ass. You've been following me like a hawk
          from the fucking medieval times; don't you ever catch a break?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will catch a break when I prove to everyone that you tried to kill
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile remained as I tilted my head to the side. "Oh wow, that's a
          new one. Are you done trying to prove to everyone that I have other
          motives and I'm not who I say I am?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched as he shook his head slowly, eyes filled with
          distrust and irritation, "I don't know why no one else sees it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe because there's nothing to see?" I told him, "Cassie, you need
          to relax, smile more, be open and free, and while you're at it, pull
          out the fucking stick from your ass; not everyone who comes around
          your boss has other motives."
        </p>
        <p>
          He straightened, hard eyes pinning me with a stare that would have
          made me cower if I hadn't been in total control of the situation. "You
          have other motives."
        </p>
        <p>"And do you have proof to back your claim?"</p>
        <p>His jaw locked.</p>
        <p>
          "Good, you don't. Sometimes it pays to stay out of other people's
          businesses," I said, my eyes searching the piercing golden hour blue
          of his as I took a step closer to him, curling my lips further up when
          I spoke my next words quietly, "Maybe when you do, you might be able
          to avoid...unforeseen circumstances."
        </p>
        <p>His nostrils flare, his form tight. "I knew you ordered the hit."</p>
        <p>
          After a second too long of a heated staring contest, I broke the
          silence, "What was I supposed to do?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The realization had his brows dropping, his eyes widening a bit like
          he had just been making his accusation without concrete evidence and
          was now only indeed confirming.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You threatened me, Cassie, and I have come too far to let someone
          take away every fucking thing I have worked so hard for. I don't care
          who you are; you don't just speak ahead of yourself and expect me to
          sit down and wait for you to throw the next arrow, backing your words.
          I knew you were gonna do that, and I love to eliminate a possible
          threat before they become a problem."
        </p>
        <p>"You bic—"</p>
        <p>
          "Ah, ah," I wiggled my index finger between us, "The hit was meant to
          be a kill, but you survived; therefore, take it as a warning, Mr.
          Valerio; I am not someone you want to fuck with."
        </p>
        <p>I could feel his body tighten with anger, and I smiled.</p>
        <p>
          "I am also a very simple person to understand," I told him. "If you
          don't meddle in what doesn't concern you, then I won't meddle in your
          affairs. I have nothing to do with you or the Marino empire, so back
          off and live to fight another day <i>in</i> a fight that is
          <i>actually</i> yours."
        </p>
        <p>"And what if I tell Marino all about this conversation?"</p>
        <p>
          The laugh I let escape me was small, "Like the other times you've
          tried to tell him? I'm curious, Cassie, how did all the conversation
          go?" I asked softly until my voice was almost a whisper when I took a
          step closer, "Did he listen to you?" Another step, and he sucked in a
          breath at my closeness, yet, his eyes didn't stray away from mine, "or
          did you both manage to enter another topic of conversation that took
          my name out of," my gaze fell to his lips, "your mouth?" I lifted my
          eyes back to his again.
        </p>
        <p>"You think this is a game?" he asked me.</p>
        <p>
          "I don't play games, Casmiro," I said, puckering my lips to the side
          as I let my hand trail up his arm, tingling and trailing atop every
          rugged ridge of his muscles, which tensed up after my touch.
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck are you doing?" He bit out.</p>
        <p>
          I took the final step, my chest a push from brushing his, but the man
          didn't inch back away from the warmth my skin supplied. Watching him,
          my tongue ran softly by my bottom lip, catching his eyes. "I'm trying
          to understand your obsession with me; what is it exactly, Cas?" I let
          my hand work up his shoulder, "Do you want me? Is that it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Disgust filled his eyes as he stepped away sharply like he had been
          burned. "You're fucking insane."
        </p>
        <p>
          I laughed freely now, stopping the vibration from my chest when I
          threw the drink down my throat in one gulp, letting the alcohol burn
          me as I swallowed, dashing him a grin, "What, I can't joke around
          anymore?"
        </p>
        <p>"You don't deserve him."</p>
        <p>
          My laughing ceased, and every facial muscle of mine concocted into a
          glare. "He doesn't deserve <i>me</i>," I corrected. The hardness in my
          tone was one I had almost forgotten existed after setting myself up
          for this fucking journey. "You don't fucking know me, Casmiro; you
          don't know how hard I've had to fight for my place in this world. You
          don't know what it's like being born for a <i>despicable </i>reason,
          having your life snatched away from you before it's even yours."
        </p>
        <p>
          Realizing that I'd spoken more than I should, I tried to calm myself,
          inching back from him and steadying my breathing.
          <i>I didn't need this right now</i>. "Listen, I really like Elio. I
          care about him in ways I've never cared about anyone; I might not know
          how to show it, and it might seem like getting close to him is for a
          fucked up reason, but it's not. I don't want it, but I'm dealing with
          it. Because I care."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, "I commend your loyalty to him, it's hard to find these
          days, and I am so happy that he has someone like you to look out for
          him, but take your eyes off me, Casmiro, because I am not his problem,
          neither do I intend to be."
        </p>
        <p>He said nothing after that, and I took that as my cue to leave.</p>
        <p>
          I took the longer route to the side deck where most people were
          hanging out, celebrating the last day on the sea, although Kareem had
          organized a dinner party. I had gotten myself and the rest of STREET
          invited, too, as Kareem had insisted on meeting my friends the last
          time we spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past week, I'd spent little time charming Kareem into making
          me his favorite person, but most of my time had been spent in Elio's
          suite. We finished watching the whole Lucifer series together. Started
          another one he said Angelo had recommended. We ate together and slept
          together most time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping our hands off each other was a struggle. I had suddenly
          forgotten how to control myself, but I knew it was him; it was all
          him, his body, the way he handled me, his shitty attitude that had
          stopped bothering me but instead turned me on half the time. It had
          been peaceful and blissful.
        </p>
        <p>Quiet and Normal.</p>
        <p>
          But it was time to work, to get serious. I couldn't let the likes of
          Casmiro get to me or ahead of me; I couldn't let his words mess with
          my head because I was still in control of the situation. I still held
          the gun, the reins, and the lever. It was still my move, and I didn't
          intend to show my hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was calmer, I found Milk sitting in a corner, staring ahead at
          the people by the railing, five girls dressed beautifully in light
          clothing like us, smiling, laughing, and talking animatedly. I settled
          beside her, having refilled my drink on the way here.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze shifted to the side, and I spotted Angelo, shirtless with
          white knee-length shorts, talking to Elio, whose hair was barging with
          the breeze, the black loose short-sleeved shirt he wore, danced around
          his body, the first three buttons undone, his pants too was a little
          on the oversized side, and the wind carried it as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          His tattooed hand held a whiskey glass, half filled. There was a cigar
          between his lips, burning away as he listened to whatever Angelo was
          saying, with a frown on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled to myself, wondering how the fuck I could just grab a random
          person's attention and point toward Elio just to tell them he's mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          By chance, he lifted his gaze my way, and I was filled with glee, my
          stomach doing a flip that had me smiling at him. He looked away
          without returning the gesture, and my smile died.
        </p>
        <p>Never mind.</p>
        <p>"Fucking rude prick," I muttered.</p>
        <p>Milk blinked, looking over at me, "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Not you," I answered, taking a sip of my drink, "It's nothing, just
          another episode of 'my boyfriend's a prick to me, and I am trying so
          hard not to gut him.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          She chuckled, looking back at the girls. "You and Elio share a very
          weird relationship,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know," I said, following her line of vision again. "What's up with
          you? You wanna hang out with them?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She snapped her head to me, eyes wide, "What? No...I mean, yeah? But
          they are like way out of my league in the social aspect of things,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I scrunched my nose, "They're normal girls who would probably kill to
          have your looks. And like you once told me, don't sell yourself
          short,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She sighed, turning her head to watch them again. "I'm not; it's
          just—beauty isn't everything, you know, and I love STREET and you, but
          sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have a group of
          girlfriends, you know? Where you can talk about all things and laugh
          freely like they're doing now. I'm not saying we can't or don't do
          that, but if I were normal and had a job, I could walk up to them and
          say hi, and if they asked me what I did for a living, I wouldn't say I
          cheat or steal from people, I would say, I own a jewelry store or a
          shopping mall, or a salon," she gave a wistful laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my lips together, "I get what you mean, but you gotta
          remember you didn't ask for this life, and we still have the future,
          and you're still young, and you could still make lots of girlfriends
          who would kill to just say hi to you, I mean, you're one of the
          coolest people I know."
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked back at me, her skin bathing in the setting sun, "Really?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yup." I offered her a smile.</p>
        <p>"Thank you, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, looking back at the girls, my eyes centering on one in
          particular. She was familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blonde hair, pretty smile, and apparently, a beautiful laugh, and that
          aura—the aura of <i>perfection</i>.
        </p>
        <p>I tilted my head to the side, "I know that one,"</p>
        <p>"Which one?"</p>
        <p>
          "The blondie, the one in the short red net dress that screams
          attention?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's brows shot up, "Oh my God, she's the prettiest; I mean, they're
          all pretty, but she just outshines them all; she got my attention to
          the circle. Where do you know her from?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I squinted my eyes, "Hmph, the first night I spent at Elio's, she
          knocked on his door and apologized when she saw me; apparently, she
          had taken the wrong route, said something about having directional
          issues or some shit along that line,"
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, that's odd."</p>
        <p>
          My eyes shifted toward Elio; his gaze was on his whiskey glass, and he
          was nodding at whatever Angelo said.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I looked back at the circle of girls to see the blondie's
          gaze shifting to his direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, watching her watch Elio and Angelo; her concentration was
          not exactly on the animated conversation around her; she had a little
          frown on her brows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why is she..." Milk trailed off, looking towards Elio's direction and
          then the blondie. "Looking at them?"
        </p>
        <p>I sat up straighter, "No idea,"</p>
        <p>
          Milk chuckled, "They're quite something to look at; why are we
          surprised?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's not the, 'wow they're hot look' that's a 'what the hell are
          they talking about' look," I told Milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, studying the situation as she said, "I don't even
          wanna know how you broke thaaaa..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio's gaze shifted purposefully to the blondie, and it held for
          seconds too long before he looked away, shaking his head while
          removing the cigar from his lips and taking a drink before responding
          to Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>"...t down," Milk completed. "I didn't just imagine that, did I?"</p>
        <p>
          "Nope," I said, drinking the rest of the content in my glass before
          dropping it beside me and getting to my feet. "Gotta go," I said,
          without taking my eyes off Elio, "I'll see you at the event,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, take it easy; it might just be a normal eye lock thing; it
          happens with strangers all the time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, "Yeah, I know," it happens with strangers, but I hated the
          tightness in my stomach. She was pretty, perfect, every guy's ideal
          girlfriend. I knew I was pretty too, and a whole package, but I also
          knew when there was someone better than me in all aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beauty, style, charm, a perfect rich-girl childhood, awesome parents,
          and a remarkable upbringing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want someone like that looking at what was mine, and I didn't
          like what was mine looking at someone like that and realizing they
          could do so much better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hated this feeling. It was pathetic. Not often did I feel insecure,
          but after that conversation with Casmiro and my growing feelings for
          this man, there was no control over the pathetic nervousness that made
          my palms sweaty.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a last farewell to Milk, who had also gotten up to seek Upper and
          the guys, I made my way toward Elio, who spotted me before I reached
          him.
        </p>
        <p>Angelo stopped talking as he, in turn, spotted me.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey Angie," I greeted, hooking my arm into Elio's, clinging to him.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra," he cleared his throat, "wonderful evening,"</p>
        <p>
          "It is, indeed." I grinned, knowing I had interrupted some intense
          conversation between them, "Will you be attending the event?"
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head, "Not immediately."</p>
        <p>
          "Work?" I asked, and he nodded, prompting me to look up at Elio, who
          made no attempts to shrug off my hold, "Cut him some slack, all work
          and no play...how's he gonna get some?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He does not work for me," Elio responded, looking down at me, tone
          firm.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I work for him. He loves to deny it," Angelo said, snatching the
          cigar from Elio's hand, "That's a third one too many," then he turned
          to me, "Please try to monitor his cigars; it's getting worse."
        </p>
        <p>"One more word—"</p>
        <p>"I will do that, Angie, <i>fiercely</i>."</p>
        <p>
          "I have no doubt," Angelo said, with one curt nod my way and then one
          last glance at a glaring Elio before he walked away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to stand in front of the frowning man. "He's right; you should
          go easy on the cigars."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should as well go easy on your inability to abstain from
          situations that do not concern you," he stated, sounding irritated.
        </p>
        <p>"That was rude."</p>
        <p>
          He made no move to apologize; his stare was almost blank, safe for the
          irritation lingering in those eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, "It's just advice from people who care about your
          well-being," I closed the space between us, raising a little to kiss
          the side of his neck, "And your health."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm,"</p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes, fully standing on the heel of my feet, "Give me a
          kiss; let's call a mini truce."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is unnecessary to call a truce when there was no war prior to—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ugh," I groaned, cupping the side of his face and pressing my lips to
          his, hoping to God that the blondie saw it and knew he was fucking
          taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />Breaking away from the kiss, my thumb grazed his bottom lip, "I
          have taken the liberty of getting you an outfit for the event."
        </p>
        <p>He raised a brow, his throat working, "Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because you are color blind, and today, we will fix that by making
          you wear something different. We'll call it liberty day, where you do
          what you don't usually do. How does that sound?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He gave me a warning stare, "I am not color blind, and I do not trust
          the mischief in your eyes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Trust me, you'll love what I selected." I held on to his wrist. "Come
          on,"
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          I had picked out a somewhat light brown round-necked short-sleeved
          shirt, coupled with soft cream-colored beige pants to go with it, for
          Elio. He was going to shock many people tonight, and while I would
          love to see that, I really wanted him to get out of his self-made
          comfort zone for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had spent three days and two blow jobs trying to convince this man
          to attend this event, not because I really, <i>really</i> wanted him
          there, but because almost everyone who was everyone was going to be
          there, and he was going to be stuck here alone when everyone was
          having fun, living their lives and enjoying it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to show him that his concept of life being better only when
          predetermined wasn't exactly ideal; I wanted to show him that it was
          okay to live for now and in the moment, and maybe I just needed him to
          loosen up so I could approach a topic I had been finding difficult to
          discuss with him, given his very concerning ability to read me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing in front of the mirror in Elio's dressing room, I examined my
          armless thigh-length emerald green dress. I selected it mainly because
          it provided easy leg movement and was very simple. Nothing too flashy,
          just something attractive and appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only problem now was my hair; I'd tried raising it, curling it,
          and leaving it straight, but nothing seemed to work. I wish I hadn't
          ignored the growing length and had done something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried doing a short, low ponytail, but it would look awkward because
          it wasn't long enough to look pretty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, this is not comfortable; it feels as though I am being
          strangled—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned sharply after catching a glimpse of him in the mirror, and my
          jaw practically hung.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You look...lovely," he told me, eyes raking down the length of my
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you look..." God, when I selected his outfit from the boutique
          Milk and I had gone to get clothes for this event, I had a visual of
          how he would look in it, but nothing could have prepared me for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shirt and the pants hugged him, not too much, but enough, his
          chest, his biceps, his arm, broad shoulders, torso, his perfect
          narrowed waist, the way his pants showed off his muscled thighs and
          perfect legs and the way the whole brown and cream seemed to mesh with
          his skin color, and the color of his eyes, it was fucking new...even
          though I had seen him in a white sweater before this—this was
          different—him in regular clothing was a new kind of sexy I did not
          prepare myself for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I returned my gaze to his face, which now held a frown. "I hope that
          look is you telling me I should go change—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hell no!" I yelled, and I felt the force of my voice from my chest.
          "Change never."
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          I blinked, swallowing, "I mean, you look sexy. Very sexy,
          off-the-charts sex appeal, sex on legs, on strong, strong legs, very
          sex material—" <i>What am I saying? </i>
        </p>
        <p>"This is not decent, right?" he looked confused.</p>
        <p>
          "It is very decent in a sexy kind of way. Definitely not
          professional." I told him as I walked closer, his cologne melting my
          resolve. He smelt so good. "But it's liberty day, so, yes, you are
          wearing this to the event." sucking in a breath, I ran my hands up and
          down his biceps, feeling him up as I muttered what was supposed to
          have stayed in my head. "Lord, do I want to use this body...fuck me."
        </p>
        <p>"Now?"</p>
        <p>
          I snapped my head up to look at him, "Oh no...I meant uh...I was
          cursing myself because I am really appreciating you and your awesome,
          awesome body. Carved for me." I smiled at him.
        </p>
        <p>He watched me, "It was not technically carved for—"</p>
        <p>
          "Shut up, just go with it," I told him. "And please, you look good,
          like really good, like no one is going to stop staring at you good.
          You look like some mundane banker who frequents the gym and has a
          lovely girlfriend whom he is loyal to."
        </p>
        <p>"Is there a hidden message there, somewhere?"</p>
        <p>"Of course not."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, "Thank you for saying I look good; I quite like the color,
          but I would have preferred something less—slinky. You are very flushed
          right now, querida."
        </p>
        <p>
          "All for good reasons," I smiled, "But trust me, it is perfect and
          decent but different, and it's liberty night for you, so we're going
          with it."
        </p>
        <p>"Liberty night is not a registered thing."</p>
        <p>"I know, but it's our thing now." I smiled.</p>
        <p>
          "Okay," he responded, a light tone in his voice to show that he liked
          it. He liked 'our' thing.
        </p>
        <p>"Great, now I just gotta figure out what to do with my hair."</p>
        <p>
          His gaze moved to it, and then he raised his hands, his wristwatch
          glinting in the light as he brushed my hair back. "Would you like my
          help?"
        </p>
        <p>I raised a brow in inquiry, "Can you help?"</p>
        <p>"Irrelevant question; I would not have asked if I couldn't."</p>
        <p>
          "A simple yes, Elio, just a yes was all I needed." Walking back
          towards the mirror, I groaned, and he followed behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stop asking irrelevant questions, and I will stop giving irrelevant
          answers."
        </p>
        <p>"You're too much."</p>
        <p>"I am not."</p>
        <p>"You always have to get the last word in, don't you?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, I do." He said, pinning me down on the stool in front of the
          mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met his gaze in the reflection and smiled, and he returned it with a
          small one as his hands fell to my hair, "It's longer than it used to
          be."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I haven't had the time to cut it." My hair had fast growth, and
          I always made sure to stick to my preferred length, but these past few
          months had been packed.
        </p>
        <p>"I like it like this. I like long hair." He said.</p>
        <p>"Well, Good for you?"</p>
        <p>"Will you let it grow more?"</p>
        <p>"I most certainly do not plan to."</p>
        <p>
          I caught him nod, "That's a shame." He met my gaze through the mirror,
          his hands falling from my hair, "Before I start, I have something for
          you,"
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          He dipped a hand into his pocket, and I frowned, wondering what he was
          pulling—
        </p>
        <p>
          My thoughts stopped as a silver-like necklace surfaced; it was shiny,
          with a butterfly pendant. My lips parted open, but I didn't utter a
          word. I couldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cleared his throat, "I got this the day you went to get your
          tattoo. It had a small necklace case, and it was not overall expensive
          because I could not go far after I left the car," he cleared his
          throat again, "Long story unnecessary, I could not find the right time
          to give this to you, but I reckon it would look good with your dress."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, meeting his gaze again as I took my hair from the way, "Put
          it on me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, putting the necklace around my neck, and <i>God</i>, it was
          beautiful, and I knew then and there that I was never taking it off.
        </p>
        <p>I touched the pendant once he had hooked it in.</p>
        <p>"It's beautiful, Elio."</p>
        <p>He placed his hands on my shoulders, "It is."</p>
        <p>"Thank you, I really love presents; I don't get them often."</p>
        <p>"I see,"</p>
        <p>
          I played with the pendant, the sparkly butterfly representing how hard
          my stomach was dancing with them and how wide my chest was swelling,
          as I secretly swooned, loving this gesture more than I should.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept staring at him while he made do with his promise to style my
          hair; I couldn't think straight at this point; something had changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          These feelings surrounded my chest, a perfect distraction—a perfect
          root for guilt.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The event was huge, and we had been there for over three hours now. As
          predicted, Elio had caught the eyes of many, especially Kareem, who
          was surprised and was talking at the height of his voice, going into
          an epistle about how much Elio needed to start embracing other habits
          and life being too short to be so routine oriented.
        </p>
        <p>
          STREET and I had gotten our chance to speak with Kareem, and he had—as
          expected—taken a liken to Milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had spent half the time with STREET while Elio had been with
          Casmiro, Angelo, and some other men I did not care to acquaint myself
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk had gushed about the necklace, and I had tried to act like it was
          not a big deal, but it was—it meant a lot to me that he gifted me
          something so pretty—I felt special, and the gesture went to my head,
          and I didn't know how to put it in words the extent to how much I
          loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another hour passed, and I observed my surroundings; people were
          everywhere, and familiar faces were scarce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another hour passed, and I asked Milk what the time said; it was
          almost midnight, and I cracked the stiff muscles in my neck—excusing
          myself from STREET before seeking Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found him alone in a secluded area. It was quiet, directly showing
          the night sky from the open space behind him. He was sitting there,
          observing, bored, probably irritated. I almost felt guilty for leaving
          him to himself, but STREET and I had engaged in our usual rating
          people game, and it got rowdy when some group of guys and girls joined
          our table, and I lost myself in the sheer youthfulness of it all—<i
            >mostly bracing myself.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>He raised his gaze in my direction.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey there, Stranger." I grinned, settling beside him on the soft
          white couch, pressing my body against his and breathing him in. his
          arm wrapped around me.
        </p>
        <p>"You left me alone," he said.</p>
        <p>
          "Sorry," I said, kissing his jawline, "We had a full table, and I
          couldn't leave because we had this game with some real cool ass
          people, and Milk had been feeling sad about us not making enough
          girlfriends, and it was just fun...Liberty night fun," I grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do I do to become a priority? One that comes first before your
          friends."
        </p>
        <p>
          I laughed softly, wrapping my arm around his shoulders, "We have a
          long way to go till then, buddy. Where's Cassie and Angie?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gone. Around. I have no idea. But Casmiro told me he would be
          retiring early."
        </p>
        <p>"And your security detail?" I looked around.</p>
        <p>
          "Liberty night. I do not like the following. Besides, not many people
          recognize me like this. I like it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned at his admission. "I told you, and you're in good hands;
          Kareem's security detail is pretty strong."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm," he said, hand caressing my naked shoulder as he pressed a light
          kiss there. "When do we leave?" he asked quietly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Soon." I told him, "I was hoping to talk to you about something now
          that we're partially alone."
        </p>
        <p>His gaze raised to meet mine. "What is it?"</p>
        <p>
          I pulled back a little from him. "Well, nothing serious, It's just
          about the painting."
        </p>
        <p>He watched me, "What about it?"</p>
        <p>"I want STREET back in your search."</p>
        <p>
          He drew back further, his brows drawing down in a frown as he said,
          "There is no need for that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, "But we were in the game before you shoved us off, and we're
          still on the quest; I just think it would be better if we work
          together."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have it under control; if it is the gold you are concerned about, I
          have plans to get it to you and your friends without you having to
          work for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's the thing," I didn't take my eyes off his, "No one takes care
          of our business for us; we like the hustle."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I have an easy way out." His voice was straight. He didn't like
          talking about this with me. "I am buying the manor."
        </p>
        <p>I paused. Blinking at him. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. Once I buy it, I buy everything in it. Security will be doubled,
          and no one will go there unless I authorize it. I will take a tour
          with Kareem himself to oversee the environment."
        </p>
        <p>"And how long will this whole buying process take?"</p>
        <p>"A couple of weeks—"</p>
        <p>"We don't have that much time, Elio."</p>
        <p>His frown deepened. "Why are you in a hurry?"</p>
        <p>
          "<i>Because</i> everyone else is in a hurry. Word is out that all the
          paintings found in that warehouse are counterfeits, and it's only a
          matter of time for someone to figure out where exactly the original
          is. We're not the only ones in search of this thing."
        </p>
        <p>"I am aware."</p>
        <p>
          "Then why are you willing to wait for weeks to actually have it with
          you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because my gut says so, and there is no way you are getting to tour
          that manor before I do; that being the case, there is no way for you
          and STREET to get the painting before me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him carefully, breathing out. "What if I can get a tour
          early, like, let's say, the day after tomorrow."
        </p>
        <p>"Impossible; Kareem gave me his word." He shot back, confident.</p>
        <p>"But what if."</p>
        <p>"I would not bet on it."</p>
        <p>
          "Well, I would." Sighing a little, I allowed a smile to stretch across
          my lips, "In fact, I bet I could go talk to him now and get myself
          that tour."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio watched me with a calculative stare, trying to understand where
          this was leading.
        </p>
        <p>"You would fail," he said.</p>
        <p>
          "I love a challenge," I told him, straightening. "Let's bet on it."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, this is un—"</p>
        <p>"Come on," I urged, "let's bet on it."</p>
        <p>
          He sighed like he was only trying to indulge me. "Fine. What would you
          like to bet on?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "If I fail to get myself a tour," I swallowed, "then I would sit back,
          swallow my pride and let you do all the work for me,"
        </p>
        <p>"I like that."</p>
        <p>"Yeah, I know you do."</p>
        <p>"And if you manage to get the tour?"</p>
        <p>
          My lips curled at the side as I shifted closer to him again, letting
          my hand rest against his chest, "I get..." I drawled... "a one-time
          pass to take over in the bedroom."
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyebrows shot up. "Interesting..." Suspicion was in his eyes, but
          curiosity soon clouded it.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you say?" I asked.</p>
        <p>His hand came to rest on my waist. "I say we have a deal."</p>
        <p>
          I smiled, pressing a closed-mouthed kiss to his lips, "I knew there
          was a reason why I liked you. Why don't we drink to it? Seal the
          deal."
        </p>
        <p>"I've had enough drinks for tonight."</p>
        <p>"Liberty night, Elio. We are dropping self-made laws, remember?"</p>
        <p>He hesitated but then nodded. "Okay."</p>
        <p>
          I grinned, inching away from him before my gaze moved to the
          semi-distant crowd ahead of us. I found the waiter just by the side
          and gestured him over.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he reached us, I picked two drinks from the tray, which held
          four; I passed one to Elio and thanked the waiter as he went off.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, cheers to me winning again." I clinked my glass to his.</p>
        <p>
          "This ego of yours is a problem you need to tackle," he said, bringing
          his glass to his lips as I drank mine in one go while he drank half of
          his.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ugh, it's not even strong alcohol." I grimaced. "Should I call
          another one?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is fine; this is alright." He said, dropping his half-filled glass
          on the table and checking his watch. "It is almost midnight."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The party always starts at midnight; look around; people are just
          arriving." I told him, "Also, I still have a bet to win."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, "Maybe I should retire before you. I have a little
          work to get done with some papers Casmiro needs me to overlook. And I
          should probably go speak to Kareem about a certain tour."
        </p>
        <p>I watched him as he straightened.</p>
        <p>I laughed lightly, "Right...I'll let you go."</p>
        <p>
          Something in my voice must have made him look back at me with a slight
          frown. He probably didn't think much of it...until he moved to stand
          and stumbled back on the couch.
        </p>
        <p>Then he blinked.</p>
        <p>Once, twice.</p>
        <p>
          I watched him swallow as he turned to meet my gaze, eyes unfocused but
          hard. "Did you..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes?" I asked, shifting closer and holding him to stop his swaying
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you...I don't feel..." he blinked a few more times, "You fucking
          spiked my drink?" his tone was low and slow, dark and angry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held him steady to my body, but I could tell he was trying to get
          off my hold, but he had no control anymore. Even though he was tense,
          he was mine to control.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart hammered as my fingers danced into his hair while my other
          rubbed his back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We made a bet. You didn't say we couldn't cheat," I whispered in his
          ear. "Lesson for tomorrow, Marino, whenever you make a bet with me,
          discuss the basis at large."
        </p>
        <p>
          His forehead dropped against my shoulder, his breathing unsteady,
          "Zahra—"
        </p>
        <p>"Shhhhh," I cooed, rubbing his back.</p>
        <p>
          It took only a few seconds for his body to slump entirely against
          mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, breathing and grounding my teeth hard before opening
          my eyes. Fear painted my insides red at the fact that I had managed to
          make him unconscious, <i>Elio Marino</i>, completely and totally
          vulnerable, at my mercy. But relief took away the feeling of fear when
          it dawned on me that I had managed to pull this off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I orchestrated this, I knew it was near impossible to get him
          like this, especially when he saw through me, when he was never
          careless.
        </p>
        <p>
          He trusted me. And the guilt raged because I knew I had misused it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my hand a little and didn't have to look before I heard
          footsteps rushing towards us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still held him to me, my hand still caressed his hair, and my heart
          was still pounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Transport him safely to the penthouse. No one sees you. No one comes
          into the house. Full security. Await further instructions."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, Ma'am."</p>
        <p>
          When he was taken from my arms, I refrained from watching him get
          carried away as I gulped down the guilt that strained from what I had
          to do to get him out of the ship.
        </p>
        <p>Letting out a breath, I flexed my shoulders.</p>
        <p>One down, four more to go.</p>

          <b>I HAVE </b>been too lenient, too trusting, and too <i>kind</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was nearly laughable, this situation I found myself; cuffed like a
          helpless starfish to a bed that wasn't my own, to sheets that weren't
          familiar, inside a room lit up with candles and dimmed lights.
        </p>
        <p>Mostly naked, safe for my briefs.</p>
        <p>
          My wristwatch was by the bedside table, and my clothes had been folded
          carefully on a dressing table by the far left. The room was big, and
          the bed was king-sized; the large window by the side of the balcony
          door showcased city lights—I wasn't on the cruise; I was high up—a
          penthouse.
        </p>
        <p>Unfamiliar.</p>
        <p>I laughed.</p>
        <p>
          <br />It was low; it was carefree, and it was humorless, a sound lost
          to my ears because somehow, anger had eluded me, I was left stupefied,
          and my skin was crawling.
        </p>
        <p>I had lost time.</p>
        <p>
          There was what I could presume—a blank space in my existence, hours I
          could never get back, minutes of forced vulnerability, seconds where I
          had no control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stripped, cuffed, <i>violated</i> in a way that made my hands curl
          into tight fists at a memory I did not like to remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          If my father could see me now, he would be laughing. He would say<i
            >, "I told you</i
          ><i> so</i
          ><i
            >. You only know yourself. You only trust yourself. No one else.
            Foolish boy."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>I was, indeed, foolish.</p>
        <p>
          I laughed again, shaking my head and keeping my eyes on the ceiling.
        </p>
        <p>There was nothing else that could surprise me at this point.</p>
        <p>
          Don't let your guard down, and you are blank, a plain piece of paper
          no one understands, ruthless, wicked, heartless to the point of
          damnation, setting yourself up for a life spent alone with your
          unsteady mind, drowning in self-pity and trauma, growing without a
          conscience and prepping for an eternity spent in the pits of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let your guard down, and then you're careless, weak, and incapable.
          Opening doors for people to walk all over you, you lose respect; you
          lose yourself; you become vulnerable and trusting; you allow your
          heart to lead your being to its preferred destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          You let your mind take the back seat in the moving car that is your
          life, and you let your heart sit next to you on the passenger's side.
          You smile at her; you embrace the feeling that came with her; you
          welcome it with open arms, lost in the beauty of her eyes, the effect
          of her care, the spell in her words, and the warmth of her body—so
          lost in her that you forget you're driving, until run head first into
          a tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had always alternated between 'Raising my guard' and 'Letting it
          down,' but I had never considered the grey area in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had tried both concepts, and they had somehow failed me, why was
          I holding back and stopping myself from embracing the numbness that
          seemed to scare the saner part of me?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why was I holding on to a humanity no one recognized...A humanity that
          had been challenged multiple times, one that had been pushed and
          tested.

            wicked. What is he truly capable of? Let's test him, let's defy him,

        </p>
        <p>
          I hated myself the most when I couldn't predict myself because then I
          knew I was capable of anything and everything. All wrongs would be the
          perfect rights in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >This is me now. I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't tell
            what I want to do. I am terrified of what I would do.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I was outside my body, watching the unrecognizable stranger on this
          bed. Wary and longing to take back control.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew it would be irrational to jump right to conclusions. I knew I
          should give Zahra the benefit of the doubt and wait to hear what she
          said.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for the first time in months, my mind was working faster than my
          heart—and I let it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let it because I had missed this. I let it because the urge to hurt
          was intense—it was so strong that it made my skin thrum. It made my
          head heavy, violent lucid images plagued my mind, and I needed to
          release this numbness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If my woman didn't plan to kill me, her first mistake would be letting
          me out of these cuffs, seeing as every sliver of the sane person she
          could goof around with was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          She crossed a line she shouldn't have; she tapped into a space she
          shouldn't have.
        </p>
        <p>
          She took me back to the first time I'd lost my sense of surrounding
          and self.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventeen. Happy. At peace with the fact that I had managed to impress
          my father. Until he gave me a drink, and I woke up naked next to two
          women I didn't remember meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was much like the situation I found myself in now. I was at peace,
          comfortable with someone I never thought I would grow fond of, someone
          that made me weak in all aspects, a careless addiction that I was
          beyond grateful for, my partner, the one I didn't even realize I
          trusted until she broke it with a drink.
        </p>
        <p>Until I woke up in a panic, sick to the stomach, unable to move.</p>
        <p>She had resurrected demons I had buried a long time ago.</p>
        <p>
          It was so odd because this feeling was not directed at her. It was
          directed at me. I wouldn't change anything. I would only correct,
          adjust, and rewrite.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would test the grey area. Manipulate it in my favor. I would make
          sure I gave no room for this to happen again. No room to hear my
          father laughing at me, so clear and loud, even if he wasn't there. No
          room to be this vulnerable and defenseless without my permission.
        </p>
        <p>My lack of control over my own mind vexed me.</p>
        <p>
          It fucking hurt me that I had been shoved back into this space by
          <i>her</i>. The first person I'd dropped my guard for, the first
          person I had wholly trusted without even acknowledging it to myself,
          seeing how naturally it came.
        </p>
        <p>
          This woman had seen me in ways nobody else has, no matter how
          detrimental the reasons for her actions might have been; I thought we
          had grown to the point that we shared a certain understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not care if she knew how much this occurrence would affect me.
          She should have cleared with me first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes and swallowed hard before pulling them back open.
        </p>
        <p>Almost simultaneously, the door pushed open, and in came Zahra.</p>
        <p>
          The woman behind my turmoil walked in with a champagne bottle in her
          grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wore a transparent robe that gave me a clear view of the sinful
          lingerie underneath; it was a red piece that did wonders for her
          curves. My cock twitched in response. Despite my animosity toward her,
          I couldn't deny her body's pull with mine; I couldn't look away from
          her beauty. I couldn't help myself.
        </p>
        <p>My chest squeezed.</p>
        <p>
          How far had I given her the reins to my sense of self? When had my
          body become dependent, always waiting to answer the call of hers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Her head moved in my direction, and her eyes widened. "Oh my God,
          You're awake." She almost doubled over, dropping the wine on the
          dresser and quickly coming towards me, climbing up the bed, her warmth
          enveloping me, the familiar smell of her, sweet and mind-consuming,
          filled my nostrils, made me feel light, and made my chest burn.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was over me, on top of me, her hands were on my face, and her eyes
          were searching mine. "Are you okay? Do you feel a headache? Fuck—I
          didn't check if there were any side effects from the drug because I
          was in a hurry and had to get you out of that ship. I—" she stopped,
          guilt swirling in her eyes as she took in my expression, I didn't know
          what it was, but if it was based on what I was feeling, then her
          abrupt stopping was understandable.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry," she finished. Swallowing. Her thumb grazed my cheek as
          she leaned further down, and my eyes remained open as she kissed me on
          the lips and said again, "I'm sorry." Then she started kissing my
          whole face and saying sorry repeatedly, and I failed to understand
          what exactly she was apologizing for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was too detached from this moment that it took me a while to
          register the sincerity in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>It saddened me that I couldn't understand the sincerity.</p>
        <p>
          "You're angry, I understand. You have every right to be. But I need
          you to understand that I did it all for a reason. I have receipts of
          proof to show that this was for a good cause, asides from the fact
          that, well—I love seeing you bound up—but that is by the way, I just
          need to make sure you don't want to kill me for drugging you." she
          swallowed, "Because you look like you want to kill me."
        </p>
        <p>I didn't respond.</p>
        <p>
          She sighed, her teeth biting the inner part of her lips, telling from
          how her mouth moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know I would never hurt you, right? Unless you did something to
          hurt me, and you haven't done anything to hurt me, so...you know this
          was not done out of ill will, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't take my eyes off her and didn't relieve the pressure on my
          brows or the frown on my face; my facial muscles did not agree with
          me.
        </p>
        <p><i>I don't know what I'm doing. </i></p>
        <p>
          "I knew you would conclude," she sounded disappointed. "Why wouldn't
          you conclude," she sighed, raking her hair back from her face, "I
          don't know how to be open, I don't know how to share, maybe if I knew
          how, you wouldn't be looking at me like I squeezed all the blood from
          your heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          My brows eased after that statement, and I broke eye contact with her,
          allowing my gaze to roam down her body, her neck, the tattoo on her
          shoulder, her chest, her breast under the beautiful lingerie, her
          stomach, her center over my torso, both knees on either side of me.
        </p>
        <p>A body.</p>
        <p>A woman.</p>
        <p>Sex.</p>
        <p>
          "Listen, it was important that I had to get you away from the ship,
          okay? and it wasn't just you...All of STREET, too, because there was
          something important and time-sensitive that I had to oversee, and I
          needed you guys away because—I needed STREET away because they don't
          know that part of me, and I needed you away because something else was
          going on, and there were people—"
        </p>
        <p>"Did you get the tour pass from Kareem?"</p>
        <p>
          She blinked at me, caught off guard. "Yes...I did, and it didn't
          really take much convincing. Why are—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am cuffed to your bed," I spoke, eyes lingering on her chest,
          "completely yours to control. We made a bet. I lost. You won." My gaze
          trailed up, "And now you have control," I locked eyes with her. "Take
          your prize."
        </p>
        <p>A body.</p>
        <p>A woman.</p>
        <p>Sex.</p>
        <p>
          Her mouth fell open and close before she managed to gather her words,
          "Oh...wow, you don't—you don't want to know why I—"
        </p>
        <p>"You said you have receipts, correct?"</p>
        <p>She frowned a little. "Yeah, but—"</p>
        <p>
          "Then I will see them later." I said, "But I want you now. Your choice
          of clothing is very distracting, so even if you choose to tell me
          anything now, I would not listen."
        </p>
        <p>
          She breathed in deeply, exhaling. "You're not angry? You don't want to
          talk first?"
        </p>
        <p>"We have later."</p>
        <p>
          She nodded, letting an appreciative smile fall to her lips as she
          sighed in relief, leaning down to kiss me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I accepted it, kissing her back, her soft lips a familiar brush
          against mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she pulled away, she looked at me with a softness in her eyes, "I
          appreciate your understanding. You don't know how much I've been
          overthinking ways to tell you what happened and still have this time
          with you."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>"Would you like me to uncuff—"</p>
        <p>
          "No." I cut in immediately, and she frowned as I quickly added.
          "please leave the cuffs on; I will tell you when I want them off."
        </p>
        <p>
          She shot me a sly smile. "So, you <i>are</i> into kinky things, you
          big whore."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am into whatever you are into...little slut." I told her, "Just
          don't go overboard."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No worries," she grinned, bringing her lips to my ear, "You can trust
          me," she whispered, kissing my cheek before getting off me and taking
          off her robe.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes followed her movement, locked to her ass, her hips, her legs.
        </p>
        <p>A body.</p>
        <p>A woman.</p>
        <p>Sex.</p>
        <p>
          I chanted again in my head, blocking any emotional drive from this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sooooo..." she dragged out, bringing a small purple box to light
          before turning and beaming nervously at me.
        </p>
        <p>I short-circuited.</p>
        <p>The emotional drive forced through.</p>
        <p>
          My chest expanded, but my mind shrunk that expansion almost
          immediately. The wall over my chest pushed out any of the lightness
          that bloomed whenever I caught her smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I <i>most definitely</i> have not been planning this for a while, and
          I <i>most definitely</i><i> </i>did not lure you into that
          conversation because I knew I would win the bet." She said, her tone a
          little smug.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't speak.</p>
        <p>
          "I got a toy," she bit her bottom lip, placing the box at the edge of
          the bed, "Nothing serious...but I've been waiting for it to get in the
          market for a while."
        </p>
        <p>"A toy..." I let the words trail off before adding, "A sex toy?"</p>
        <p>She nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "For who?" I asked, and she must have heard the thick question in my
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened, "Oh no! Nothing like that...You are enough for me.
          Although...it's for you..."
        </p>
        <p>"I do not do—"</p>
        <p>"No penetration, don't worry."</p>
        <p>I visibly relaxed.</p>
        <p>
          "But um," she smiled. "this is...a little more intense." She said,
          opening the box. "Have you ever heard of a cock ring?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head as she brought an object out of the box. It was
          purple and long, with two circular ring-like hoops and a thin silicon
          flat curvy plain atop it.
        </p>
        <p>I did not know what I was looking at.</p>
        <p>
          "That is supposed be around me?" I asked her, meeting her bright
          deranged gaze as she reached for a remote-like device in the box.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, and it's an e-stim."</p>
        <p>"Elaborate."</p>
        <p>
          She inspected it. "It's an electrostimulation device, has different
          intensity levels, and touches <i>every</i> sensory organ and stops you
          from cumming; it also gets you hard...really hard." She informed.
        </p>
        <p>"And you control it."</p>
        <p>
          Brown eyes, dark and lustful, rose to meet mine. "I control it."
          something in her voice darkened as she reached inside the box again,
          pulling out what I could decipher as an eye mask.
        </p>
        <p>"I assume that is for me, also?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Why do I need to cover my eyes?"</p>
        <p>
          She didn't answer, but she picked the box from the bed and discarded
          it somewhere before she crawled up to me; my eyes took her in, her
          soft movement above my body, tentative...sensual. It made my head
          spin.
        </p>
        <p>She looked so beautiful. Bewitching. So <i>mine</i>.</p>
        <p>
          My cock stirred in my briefs, and the bulge became evident. I was
          livid, I was hard, and I somehow...wanted this, curious to see what
          she would do to me, how much she could make me fold into her—even in
          this state.
        </p>
        <p>
          I responded to her, and I shouldn't. At least not this much, not this
          subjective.
        </p>
        <p>
          She smiled softly at me, "You'll see," she told me, "Do you trust me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her, eyes searching hers, unable to hide my visible swallow.
          I would have been able to answer that question without hesitating
          before, but now I hesitated, supplying a tiny nod.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lie. A false truth. I didn't trust her...just as much as I didn't
          trust myself. But I needed a release of this anger, something to take
          away the tightness in my chest, the hotness in my head.
        </p>
        <p>I needed this. Her.</p>
        <p>My chanting was forgotten.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just a body. It was Zahra's body.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just a woman. It was Zahra.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just sex. It was her.</p>
        <p><i>And I still couldn't predict myself. </i></p>
        <p>
          "Let me take care of you," she said, kissing my lips, "You don't have
          to see what I'm doing; you just have to feel it. Is that okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <br /><i>Feel</i>...was she reading my mind? Did she somehow see in my
          eyes that the last thing I wanted to do was feel? Could she sense my
          turmoil?
        </p>
        <p>"Elio?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, it is okay."</p>
        <p>
          She smiled before wearing the mask over my eyes—and I was plunged into
          darkness. My heart picked up pace, and I felt her hand on my chest,
          her lips on my neck, and my anticipation...grew.
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't see what she was doing; I could only feel it.</p>
        <p>
          A warm tongue licked down my collarbone as her body moved, along with
          her lips, kissing down my chest, torso, and the hard plane of my
          stomach, down to the lines that led to where my straining cock
          dwelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I want to taste every inch of your skin." I heard her say, her breath
          on my skin causing a different sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          She rubbed me softly against my briefs, warm palm edging my arousal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I parted my lips, letting my breaths come out of my lips. I felt her
          fingers on the hem of my briefs, pulling it off my body, and then I
          felt her hand on me, wrapping around my cock, which was rock hard, a
          subject to my woman's hand, allowing whatever torture she had for it
          without a fight. I felt myself growing harder as she stroked softly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hand took the precum, dragging it down my length, and then I felt
          her warm tongue licking from my tip to the base.
        </p>
        <p>I hissed.</p>
        <p>
          "You have the most attractive and beautiful cock I've ever seen; you
          know that?"
        </p>
        <p>"Should I thank you?" I ground out.</p>
        <p>"I didn't say you could respond."</p>
        <p>I didn't speak after that.</p>
        <p>
          <br />She sucked me into her mouth, and my world rocked; feeling her
          hand on my naked thigh as she worked me to total hardness, the
          sensations heightened—I was surprised, wondering if this was because I
          couldn't see what was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hand felt so good wrapped around me, and my heart was hammering. I
          felt a rush of excitement, a budding expectancy I couldn't explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed as she kissed the throbbing length like it deserved the
          little peck for being so responsive to her touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt her shift and then a soft click. Nothing happened for about six
          seconds, but then her hand was suddenly on me, and I bucked up a
          little, not expecting her grip, and then something came around my
          length—The toy she had held, strung a tight hold against the head of
          my cock and the base—locked in place, and the feel of it alone,
          wrapping me like a vice, had my lips parting to suck in a sharp
          breath.
        </p>
        <p>It felt different...<i>good</i>.</p>
        <p>"Are you okay?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," I said, sounding almost breathless as I felt her body move
          again, and I felt her familiar shadow above me. Her hand grazed my
          chin.
        </p>
        <p>"Good. I like you like this. You're so fucking hot like this."</p>
        <p>"Hm," I groaned out; it was hoarse and grounded.</p>
        <p>
          "Things might get a bit intense, so I'll give you a safe word in case
          you feel over—"
        </p>
        <p>"¿Me estás insultando?"</p>
        <p>
          I heard her chuckle, and I could see how her eyes narrowed and shone
          without seeing her. That was how much I had mastered her expressions,
          how I knew the kind of face she made after speaking, how I had
          recognized the smugness in her voice seconds before she had drugged
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even then, I decided to ignore the slight tightness in my stomach
          until I couldn't stand and lost all control of my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not insulting you. We need to be safe, so I think we need one."
        </p>
        <p>"I won't need it," I told her firmly.</p>
        <p>
          "Still." She said, and I felt her thumb finger trace my bottom lip.
          "I'll give you one," her teeth clamp down on my unsuspecting lip, her
          tongue replacing her thumb as she softly said, "One of my favorite
          colors..." she trailed off, her teeth biting gently and releasing as
          she whispered, "Red."
        </p>
        <p>I gulped down. "I will not use it."</p>
        <p>
          "Let's hope you don't," she said, tapping my cheek softly. "Give me a
          moment; I'll be back."
        </p>
        <p>
          Movements—and then she was off me, the soft patter of her footsteps
          and a door opening and closing, then...
        </p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>
          A silence too heavy even my thoughts couldn't find a space to
          infiltrate and torment me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short while, she was back, the door closed, and I heard soft
          movements and her footsteps here and there, on my left, and then my
          right...
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing?"</p>
        <p>
          "Fixing the temperature of the room." She said, and then light
          shuffling sounds followed.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing now?"</p>
        <p>"Getting naked." I could hear the smile in her voice.</p>
        <p>A moment later, I felt her on the bed again above me.</p>
        <p>
          "I have a few rules," she said, the mischief in her aura making my
          stomach jump, her skin grazing against my waist area. "Don't flinch or
          move while I explore you...if you do, I'll dial up the intensity of
          the ring around your cock. For every flinch, there is a repercussion.
          Am I clear?"
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>"A yes or no, Elio."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, you are clear, Zahra." I didn't understand why I would flinch.
          What was she planning?
        </p>
        <p>"No. Call me Ma'am."</p>
        <p>"Te estás divirtiendo con esto, ¿verdad?"</p>
        <p>"Si." She responded "Mucha diversión."</p>
        <p>"Fine, you are clear, <i>ma'am</i>."</p>
        <p>
          I knew she was smiling; somehow, she made me see it without seeing it.
          And it was beautiful, soft, stretched the sides of her lips, her eyes
          alight in admiration and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of something uncapping met my ears, and the smell of
          chocolate filled my nostrils.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, wondering why there was choco—</p>
        <p>
          Hot burning liquid met the skin of my chest, and I flinched at the
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          A light vibration in my cock had my hips jerking off the bed a little,
          and my mouth fell open as my body tingled. Blood rushed to my cock
          like it had been summoned, and I felt a shudder skid through me.
        </p>
        <p>What is...</p>
        <p>Fuck...the zing-zap sensations crawling through me felt so good.</p>
        <p>"You flinched," Zahra said. "I told you not to flinch."</p>
        <p>
          The smell of chocolate was still around us, and I could still feel the
          burn of whatever she had placed on my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my cock throbbing and my head in a daze, I felt her lips over the
          spot she had burned with the...chocolate. Her tongue—very cold like
          she had been sucking on ice— licked whatever liquid she had placed on
          my chest, soothing the burn, but the pain from it and the sound from
          the fucking toy around my length made me strain my wrist against the
          cuffs, unable to move, to see and touch—I could only <i>feel</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thick, hot chocolate with your skin tastes divine. Best fucking
          dessert I ever had." She kissed me there. "I can still see your skin
          turn red even with your tattoos."
        </p>
        <p>
          My chest was heaving slightly, but I still had control; the sensation
          from the stimulation was beara—
        </p>
        <p>
          I flinched when hotness spread over the other side of my chest, the
          burn running slowly to the middle, and the intensity of the ring
          doubled. I had the instinct to touch myself and soothe some of the
          aches, but I was restrained; my muscles tightened and tensed up at the
          new sensations traveling all around my body at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was mind curling, my feets tugging at the restraints. A sensation
          in my spine traveled up front to my stomach and my girth, hard and
          strangled against the rings.
        </p>
        <p>
          My breathing grew louder every minute my cock twitched from the sweet,
          sweet sensations taking their time to trickle and settle inside my
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, her cold tongue licked up from where the hot liquid had
          been dripping to where she had initially poured the chocolate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard a devilish chuckle leave her like she was having the time of
          her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was fucking breaking sweat, loving the pain too much—and the
          pleasure. It was tickly, a little overwhelming, but controlled—
        </p>
        <p>
          The sudden feel of a burn spreading in a circular sense around my left
          nipple had me flinching—again, and almost immediately, the vibration
          from the cock ring grew louder, and I heaved out a loud breath, my
          chest warming, my stomach tightening.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck." I breathed out a curse as her mouth enclosed my nipple, cold
          and tantalizing as she sucked the chocolate off me, wet tongue
          intensifying an intensity that didn't need to be strengthened.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ring was gripping the head of my cock, squeezing me like it wanted
          to provoke a release, but it didn't; it just kept me there, on edge,
          vibrating, pulsing—
        </p>
        <p>
          Another burn on my other nipple, and my body jerked at the effect; the
          intensity increased—
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck, Zahra." my head pressed back tightly into the pillow, my eyes
          squeezing shut at the new feeling erupting from my cock; I was drawn
          up tight, my stomach muscles tensing as this wicked woman licked me
          clean while I pulsed, ached and fucking <i>felt</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt like the same sensation hitting my cock was hitting every part
          of my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was pounding, the vein in my neck pulsing, sweat building and
          erupting from my—
        </p>
        <p>
          I flinched as hotness suddenly dropped down my chest, and the
          intensity doubled. A deep groan dragged out from my throat as I
          gripped the sheet hard beneath my cuffed hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          My cock was dripping precum, and I was so fucking hard to the point
          that I thought I would erupt on the fucking spot without being
          touched; I was pulsing and erect.
        </p>
        <p>Almost sore.</p>
        <p>
          The pain was driving me mad, but it paved the way to this rush I
          couldn't stop, this shiver that had acquainted itself with my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My God, you're so flushed you should see how hot your skin is," she
          said in a breathy moan, sounding like she was overly affected by the
          way she completely undid me—
        </p>
        <p>
          Another unexpected hotness on my torso. It burned my skin—the pain
          causing yet another flinch that sent a jolt to my cock even before
          Zahra increased the intensity again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah!" I hissed sharply, the sound, a moan, a groan, and a choke mixed
          to form rubbish in my ear. My heart was racing, vigorously trying to
          find a finish line, but I could find none.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted release so bad, but the edging was fucking bitter-sweet; I
          was charged with sensory stimulation that had even my toes fucking
          curling, and all nerve endings in my body had rushed to my angry
          erection.
        </p>
        <p>Zahra's breathing was getting loud.</p>
        <p>"Are you—are you touching yourself?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Mmm, yes."</p>
        <p>"I want to see."</p>
        <p>
          "No," she breathed and then brought her fingers to my mouth. "Open,
          taste me."
        </p>
        <p>
          And I did, taking her finger into my mouth and sucking in the familiar
          taste of her. My tongue swirled around her fingers, and I was aching
          to fuck her, lick her, touch her, hold her. She removed her hand all
          too quickly, and I wanted to taste more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt her shift a little; I was still going mad with the sensations
          around my cock, how hard I could feel myself twitching and spilling
          out precum like it was the new fucking normal—I wasn't coming; I
          wanted that orgasm so intensely, I had never wanted orgasm so bad. I—a
          burn at the side of my stomach, and I flinched.
        </p>
        <p>Intensity increased.</p>
        <p>
          "F—" I grounded my teeth together so hard as my hips jerked upwards
          like Iwanted to spurt out cum, but nothing came out; it was painfully
          but pleasingly brutal, and my body shuddered, the same as my
          breathing. I was sweating, my hair was matted to my forehead, and I
          was stubborn. The vibration of the rings was very audible now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had never been so hard in my entire fucking life; it seemed like I
          was swollen and thick to the highest capacity of my length.
        </p>
        <p>I was sensitive all over.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra traced where she had burned with her tongue, but then ice—Ice
          touched my skin, and I couldn't help the fucking flinch that came
          again, and the intensity went up higher, the vibration strengthened to
          stronger pulls, the rings felt like they were around my throat even
          when they were not.
        </p>
        <p>No release, no relief, no—</p>
        <p>
          Another burn. Another flinch. The moment I felt another increase, a
          fast, sharp,intense sensation gripped my whole body, and I was tapping
          the bed.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh! Fuck, Zahra, red, red, red, red."</p>
        <p>The vibration stopped immediately.</p>
        <p>
          My breathing was all I could hear; I could feel hurried shifting, and
          then the eye mask was being removed. It was blurry when I opened my
          eyes, but I managed to catch Zahra's horrified expression. "Are you
          fucking kidding me?!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have laughed if my breathing wasn't coming in short gasps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked the blurriness away, and moisture slid from my eyes to the
          side of my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hissed, a shiver rocking through me, my body twitching. It was so
          intense, so fucking intense, painful, and good...I felt too good. Too
          charged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed in and out a few times before acknowledging Zahra's glare.
        </p>
        <p>"Take it off," I said with a sharp breath.</p>
        <p>
          With a frown, she shifted slightly to do as I asked. When she touched
          me, I flinched in a hiss, and her head snapped to my face again.
        </p>
        <p>"Gently, I'm too sensitive."</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head and carefully unclipped the toy slipping it off my
          length, and I was still hard, swollen dark red—almost purple, but it
          felt—good, even though it was painful.
        </p>
        <p>I loved the mix. It was the perfect release I needed.</p>
        <p>
          "Uncuff me," I told her, and without meeting my gaze, she proceeded to
          do the needful. Her naked body wasn't doing my situation any favor,
          and I needed to be buried inside her.
        </p>
        <p>When free, I inspected the little bruises on my wrists and body.</p>
        <p>
          She climbed back to the bed, watching me. "Why the fuck didn't you use
          the safe word sooner?"
        </p>
        <p>"I did not need to use it. Come—"</p>
        <p>"You <i>clearly</i> needed to." She cut in indignantly.</p>
        <p>I let out a small laugh, cracking my neck, from</p>
        <p>
          left to right, feeling more alive than I had in weeks—except it was
          not in the way that gave me that serenity I did not know I could have.
        </p>
        <p>"You think this is funny? I could have hurt you!"</p>
        <p>"It would not be the first time, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          She blinked at me, clearly lost. "What the fuck do you mean by that?"
        </p>
        <p>"It does not matter, come to me; let's finish this."</p>
        <p>
          She watched me for a few seconds before sighing and moving on her
          knees toward me, her eyes falling to my cock, which still looked too
          sensitive to touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand curled around the side of her face to the back of her neck as
          I pulled her to me, her lips falling against mine, and the urge to
          tighten my grip pulled strong,but I didn't buy into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her tongue brushed mine, and I tasted chocolate, the one she had been
          using to burn me. I sucked on it, drawing out a whimper from her, the
          kiss making her body soften towards me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I broke it off, and her eyes fell on my cock again. "Shit, that looks
          painful."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm. It does, doesn't it."</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze raised back to mine, which hadn't broken from her as I said,
          "Suck it."
        </p>
        <p>
          A frown dropped down her brows. "Are you demanding, or are you
          asking?"
        </p>
        <p>"Does it sound like I'm demanding?"</p>
        <p>"Yes. Don't use that tone on me; I don't like it."</p>
        <p>
          "What tone would you prefer I used?" I asked, my grip tightening on
          the back of her neck. "hm?" I voiced. "You want me to be polite?"
        </p>
        <p>She swallowed. "It's the bare minimum, Elio."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm," I gripped her thigh and pulled her leg over me as she settled
          into a straddling position. "Fine, don't put your mouth on me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed to catch her frown as I fisted my rigid length. I lined
          myself to her entrance, and she hissed at the soft brush. The urge to
          glide my cock over her wetness like I loved to do, hit me fiercely,
          but I held back and pushed the swollen crown of myself into her tight
          heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gripped my shoulders, a gasp leaving her lips, "Please go slow.
          You feel so fucking thick."
        </p>
        <p>And she felt so tight. Perfect.</p>
        <p>
          I held onto her waist before both my hands palmed her ass, squeezing
          and lifting her as I sank her onto my length, also raising my hips
          slowly until I was completely sheathed inside her—I let out an almost
          feral groan, she gripped me, wrapped me around her walls— hot and
          pulsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soft gasps escaped our mouths at the same time, simultaneously, in
          sync as always—my chest burned.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was slamming, aching to let myself feel this, to let myself
          go with this, knowing it would feel so much fucking better with the
          emotions I held for her, with my care.
        </p>
        <p>I fought for control.</p>
        <p>
          "Grip the bed head. Hard," I told her, and her hands left my shoulders
          as she steadied herself, her breasts to my face, begging for a suck
          that I couldn't help but succumb to, my tongue curling and sucking
          against the firm nub of her pierced nipple.
        </p>
        <p>
          She rotates her hips around me, seeking friction. I gave her the
          friction, lifting her with my hands still gripping her ass as I pulled
          far out and shoved back inside her again.
        </p>
        <p>
          A moan tore from her lips as she rocked her hips, sucking the breath
          out of my lungs as I thrust inside her slowly, rolling my hips as she
          followed my pace. I tookmy time, going deeper and slower like I wanted
          her to fill all of me, every inch, every vein, every twitch and pulse
          that rocked through my length, as it begged for release, begged to
          take her harder, shatter her beyond her mind's comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind was winning. The emotions were piercing, my thoughts were
          turning, gears shifting, and I was driven by pure lust and anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          My grip tightened on her as I pulled out and thrust back in with one
          hard push, the force working her body, making her breast bounce,
          making her moan loud as I filled her tight cunt, and fucked her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fucked Zahra, hard and fast, relentless and merciless, rough and
          raw, my hips slapping against her skin, sounding like fucking poetry
          to the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          The necklace I bought for her glinted as she moved, pressed against
          her skin, sticking to the sweat that had taken hold of her body, just
          like mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her breaths shot out in gasps of whimpers; her eyes screwed shut in
          pain and pleasure; I took her in, sucked in every expression she gave,
          and planted it tightly to my memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pain split my chest in half, and I closed my eyes and dropped my head
          on her shoulder as I pounded into her, my fingers going to rub her
          swollen clit, sensitive to the touch, addictive to feel against the
          pad of my fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Elio,"</i> she moaned my name, a prayer on her lips. I loved it,
          and I hated it. My pretense was fighting with my feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind was a maze, lost to the pleasure she gave me and the pain she
          dished out.
        </p>
        <p>I was taking it all, accepting it, embracing it...fuck—</p>
        <p>
          I wasn't cherishing this body; I was using it. I wasn't keeping this
          body; I was manhandling it. I wasn't adoring this body; I was
          disrespecting it. I wasn't worshiping this body; I was fucking it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flipped our position until she was on all fours, slamming into her
          again, piercing her with my thrust, harder and faster with each push.
          I ravaged her, squeezed her ass cheeks, slapped it, and loved the gasp
          that left her; I bruised her perfect skin, loving the imprint of my
          hand on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          My woman was moaning loudly, screaming, begging, sweating, completely
          undone, just like she had me, but she was meeting each of my thrusts,
          speed for speed, challenge for challenge; she liked it rough, liked me
          rough.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio, please," she begged.</p>
        <p>"You want more?"</p>
        <p>
          Her hips buckled, her ass bouncing and shaking with each slap of my
          hips, "Oh <i>fuck</i>, yes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You like this? Do you like it rough? Hm? Is this what really gets you
          off? Have you been faking it with me all this time, little slut?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She cried when my palm connected with her cheeks hard. I loved
          watching the spot go red; I loved it so much that my chest strung
          tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had never been this rough with anyone. This was carnal. An act I
          didn't know I could pull.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra Faizan made me feel everything differently, hate, anger,
          addiction, care, a deep-rooted care that had woven thorns around my
          heart, strings connecting directly to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt my release edging close; at the same time, her heat pulsed
          around my rock-hard length.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled out. Flipped her over again, her back to the mattress as I
          lifted her leg, raising it to rest on my shoulder, spreading her
          glistening pussy, the deep pinkshade pulsing with need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our gazes locked, and so did my chest. Her eyes were hooded,
          red-rimmed like she was biting back tears. Was it of pleasure? Or
          could she feel the anger buzzing in me?
        </p>
        <p>
          I removed my eyes, refused to indulge her stare as I eased into her
          again, and a strangled noise left her throat as one of my hands
          encircled around it, squeezing, not enough to make her pass out, but
          enough to bruise her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rocked my hips, in and out of her, appreciating how she clenched so
          fucking tightaround me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other hand that held her legs to my shoulders went down to her
          clit as I rubbed with the same pace I fucked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harder and faster, and faster and faster, until my mind was blank, I
          could feel the dig of her fingernails on my forearm, and I caught her
          eyes roll back, and her cunt held tight against my cock.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh fuuucck," She cried; she convulsed, she shattered, she was a mess
          of body shakes and tremors as she erupted, coming all over my cock,
          her moans tight—inside her became so wet and too lubricating, so
          fucking good that I drew tight, and could feel my orgasm at the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled out and fisted my length, and with three strokes, I spurted
          against her stomach, my hips jerking at the force of my release, a
          groan falling from my lips as I spaced out for seconds on end, my body
          shuddering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let go of my hold around her neck, placing my palm flat beside her
          head as she calmed down from her high.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You didn't cum in me," she noted, her eyes spelling wary, a distant
          heaviness I couldn't understand.
        </p>
        <p>"Too intimate," I told her.</p>
        <p>
          Her throat worked as her lips formed a slight downturn, and she
          shifted in discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>"You're angry at me." She noted yet again, and my eyes held hers.</p>
        <p>
          I don't know how long we stayed there, staring at each other, unspoken
          emotions swinging this way and that between us, until I found the
          courage to speak.
        </p>
        <p>"We need to talk." </p>

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA </b>had been in the bathroom for almost fifteen minutes.</p>
        <p>
          To say it was expressively awkward between us would be an
          understatement. She hadn't spoken a word to me or met my eyes—an
          apparent gesture that she did not want to look at me and to be fair
          with myself, I did not mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at her was not something I wanted to do too. With the thoughts
          swirling in my mind, it took more than free will to remain here,
          leaning against the table across from the bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid overthinking, I busied myself by trying to decipher what else
          was missing from my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I somehow did not feel complete, and my gaze swept around the room
          twice, but I couldn't find any of my belongings still lying around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I dropped my head, waiting—a distinct feeling of anxiousness
          clawing at my insides—but I could still feel a tiny bit of
          numbness—self-misunderstanding, and maybe slight anger if I dug well
          enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          My phone was left behind on the cruise ship, and I needed a means to
          contact Angelo or Casmiro. If they had somehow figured out I wasn't on
          board, this whole thing might be nastier than necessary.
        </p>
        <p>Just then, the door to the bathroom opened, and I raised my head.</p>
        <p>
          She came out wearing a familiar black oversized hoodie sweater that
          covered most of her. Still, I knew she had on checkered boxer shorts
          underneath, as it was her preferred choice of indoor clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recognized the sweater as one of my properties and wondered how she
          had managed to get her hands on it without my knowledge—then I stopped
          wondering when it registered in my head that she was a thief, so it
          would have been easy for her.
        </p>
        <p>It didn't bother me.</p>
        <p><i>I did not care.</i></p>
        <p>
          She closed the door behind her and raised her gaze to meet mine before
          dropping it and heading to the dressing table, pulling out a drawer
          and a well-packed file from inside it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closing the drawer, she visibly let out a breath, then walked towards
          me, outstretching the file as it shook slightly on her grip, supplying
          me the knowledge that her hands weren't steady. They were shaking.
        </p>
        <p>Ignoring it, I collected the file.</p>
        <p>
          "Those are the receipts," she said, her voice surprisingly firm. Too
          controlled. "I cumulated everything because I knew you would have
          questions." I watched her sit on the edge of the bed, right in front
          of me, slightly curled into herself—uncomfortable—as she fumbled with
          the neckline of the hoodie around her neck, dragging my gaze to the
          imprint of my hand around her neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd bruised her. I took from her instead of giving. I sated my anger
          with her body.
        </p>
        <p>It was wrong but now was not the time.</p>
        <p>
          I removed my eyes from her, letting the silence stretch on while I
          looked back at the file in my hand...not reading, not waiting for a
          papered truth that might as well be lies—I shouldn't even stand here
          for this. I should leave. Give no room for explanations, no room for
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, dropped the file on the table behind me, and crossed
          my arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          She tentatively looked up to the file and then at me, a question in
          her eyes, a heaviness I could read perfectly, but I ignored.
        </p>
        <p>I should apologize.</p>
        <p>I should.</p>
        <p>
          "You're not checking it?" for the first time since I'd known her,
          worry tainted those eyes, uncertainty ruled, courage was nowhere in
          sight, and the usual stubbornness that kept me on my toes had vacated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not see the need to look through heaps of papers supplying me
          what could very well be lies. If you do not deem it fit to justify
          your actions by actually talking to me, then we can call it a day."
        </p>
        <p>She swallowed, slow and laborious. But she remained silent.</p>
        <p>
          I grounded my teeth, clenching my jaw, "We can start by you telling me
          where the hell I am; that is if your silence is drawn from your
          inability to find a proper beginning."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands fisted around my sweater, hugging herself slightly.
          "It's...Vitale's penthouse...rented, but he was never here because he
          returned to Sicily after your warning." She supplied.
        </p>
        <p>
          A warning he foolishly adhered to. An idiot I couldn't wait to teach a
          life lesson. I loved bidding my time, but this information from Zahra
          had my skin burning and my head hot with anger. This wasn't
          necessarily his fault, but since I could not hurt Zahra, he would take
          the blow in conjunction with the one I had been waiting weeks to give
          him.
        </p>
        <p>"You brought me," I started, "To another man's house—"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't put it like that, he didn't even stay here, and he wanted to
          let them rent it out to someone else, and if I had let him do that,
          the money would go to waste. And I had all this planned, and I didn't
          have enough money to get somewhere better, so I just asked him to let
          me use it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched her for a while, not detecting any lie, even as she shrunk
          underneath my stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something had been altered in her. An odd aura she gave off in my
          presence. A vulnerability that wasn't there before, one I could
          tell—with her body language—grew from insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as she had crossed me with her actions, I had crossed her with
          mine. I did not know precisely where or how—but I knew that I wanted
          to sit beside her, take her hands, pull her to me, and say I did not
          mean to be rough or brash or to have spoken to her that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I would be lying. The only truth there would be my apology. But
          the rest had been purposeful. I had not been myself. And I wanted to
          make a point because I was still that man who did not regard
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The least I could do now would be to will myself into becoming more
          lenient with her and softening my features, but no matter how my heart
          was raging to do that, my mind refused to fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What exactly did you want to use the penthouse for? The elaborate
          sexcapade? Or is there something else? Because I fail to understand
          why you would take away my free will, like you did, what could be so
          big and terrifying that you would feel the need to drug me, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"Your life being in danger." She answered.</p>
        <p>"Explain."</p>
        <p>
          Silence followed before she sighed and started talking. "I got a tip
          from Sicily, the people working the painting case for Martino—the ones
          who informed me about Chika? They told me a dangerous elite group knew
          where the painting was. And they were on the cruise. To assassinate
          Kareem. Word must have leaked out that you wanted to buy the manor,
          and I put two and two together and realized that the elite group
          weren't there to assassinate only Kareem, as I suspected; they were
          there to assassinate the person who wanted to buy it too."
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind flashed to an odd formation I had noticed at the party, one
          that had me going back to the secluded area to observe before she
          interrupted me, and I had wanted us to leave before whatever chaos I
          sensed ensued. But a part of me wanted to see it happen, except
          without Zahra's presence.
        </p>
        <p>"I see,"</p>
        <p>
          "The elite group had arrived a week before the ending of the cruise.
          Milk and I mingled a bit, and we scored an invite to a mundane party
          they threw to throw Kareem's security detail off their scent. While I
          was there, I snooped." She said, inhaling and exhaling. "I saw
          Kareem's victim profile, two other men who talked to him just before
          you did, and then...you. They had everything about you."
        </p>
        <p>
          She breathed. "I didn't know what to do, and I wanted to inform
          Angelo, I took some pictures, and after I confirmed he was going to be
          at the party that evening, I sent them to him with a follow-up of my
          plans. This was why I made liberty day; this was why I chose a
          different color of clothing for you because it would be harder for
          them to recognize you, as you never change the color you wear."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away from her, shaking my head. "It was all a ruse.
          Everything."
        </p>
        <p>"To protect you."</p>
        <p>"And telling me beforehand would have broken one of your limbs."</p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "And Angelo—he didn't tell me anything, nobody told me anything
          because suddenly, the boss doesn't need to know if there was a target
          on his head. and Casmiro—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Angelo informed me that he told him. They worked behind the scenes to
          ensure the Elite group was caught. You telling your guards to leave
          due to—liberty day helped move you easily. We couldn't trust anybody,
          not when word got out that you wanted to buy the manor. The news
          wasn't public. So, it was either a flaw from Kareem's side or yours.
          My bet is Kareem's side."
        </p>
        <p>I have, indeed, been too lenient.</p>
        <p>
          "The information you provided still doesn't answer the question of why
          I was not informed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Have you met yourself? Would you have done anything to protect
          yourself? You chase death, you do, I know you do, and this was the
          perfect opportunity for you to embrace it without you moving a fucking
          muscle. Liberty Day or shit, you're the first guy in this fucking
          business who I know would be willing to spend the rest of his life
          putting his safety last. And I know you; I know you knew something was
          up, but you didn't move. You didn't leave."
        </p>
        <p>She was right. But I would not admit it.</p>
        <p>
          "So, drugging me was the great idea you had. You did not stop to think
          how that action would have affected me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I'm sorry. I <i>meant</i> my apology. I am sorry I did that, but
          I will not apologize for saving your life, Elio. I will not."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, I appreciate you taking the initiative. I do. But you could have
          also trusted me. If you had told me everything you figured out and not
          kept it all to yourself, acting like a hero I never asked for; you
          would not have had to drug me and make me relive a memory I had
          drowned myself in tubs, cigars, cuts and fucking burns, trying to
          forget."
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt smeared her eyes slightly red. "I am sorry, Elio. I didn't
          think—"
        </p>
        <p>"You never think; there is no surprise there."</p>
        <p>She clamped her mouth shut.</p>
        <p>
          "How about STREET? What was the need to remove them? Were you scared
          of stray bullets meeting them? Did you drug them too?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>My jaw clenched. "You drugged my brother?"</p>
        <p>Her teeth skidded across her bottom lip. "Yes."</p>
        <p>
          "To protect him too? I recall you saying there was another reason why
          you took them out."
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked rapidly like she wanted to clear her vision. "A lot
          happened tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was losing my patience, "What does this '<i>A lot</i>' entail? Care
          to elaborate?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She shifted uncomfortably, looking down. "It's not something I
          can—speak about; I don't feel comfortable speaking about it right
          now."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. A slap of anger, a blow of hurt, and a nudge of defeat were
          all I received from that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is good," I said, making her look back at me. "This is good that
          we are airing out the things we are uncomfortable with. For example, I
          am currently <i>very</i>uncomfortable with this relationship."
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "...and I know you wanted me to tell you beforehand when I got tired
          and wanted to end it, but unfortunately, I do not have that much
          patience to wait for you to review my decisions and see if I am worthy
          enough for you to deliver an answer to."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her shoulders dropped, eyes on me with a plea in them. "I
          <i>want</i> to tell you, but I—I don't know how to."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I am not pushing you to tell me." I informed her, "It is your
          choice. I am only putting an end to what I started." I said, and in
          response, something clogged and tightened in my chest at the way her
          face fell, and her breathing became a little more pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>
          She carefully rose to her feet, about to step towards me, but stopped.
          "Let us talk about this."
        </p>
        <p>"You keep saying that, but you never say anything."</p>
        <p>
          "I am <i>trying</i>, Elio. I am." Her voice held no weight, like she
          was afraid that putting in effort as she spoke would allow the shaking
          in her hands to affect her voice. "Don't make a decision right now. I
          know you're angry, and you deserve an explanation, and you feel like
          this isn't—like I am not open enough, and I know you probably think
          this was a mistake—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would not call what we had a mistake. It was not one. I only
          thought the two of us could be good together, but apparently, I was
          wrong. I cannot predict you; I do not know you as much as you know me.
          I try my best to be open <i>for</i> you, I leave everything bare, but
          you give me only what you think I need to know. I do not know what is
          real or false, I keep building trust, and you keep breaking it."
        </p>
        <p>"I never mean to—"</p>
        <p>
          <br />"How am I sure?" I pressed. "How will I know that you won't
          decide to take matters into your own hands and do something that would
          make me want to fucking strangle you? How do I know that I can trust
          you? You are not giving me anything emotional-wise, and I am giving
          you everything. Do you know how one-sided that feels?"
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head. "It's not one-sided." She said, voice quiet.</p>
        <p>"How do I know that when you won't talk to me."</p>
        <p>
          She didn't respond, and I waited and waited; my head yelling at her to
          say something, anything. But she did not speak.
        </p>
        <p>Not one word.</p>
        <p>"You won't say anything?" I asked.</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>
          I released a breath and shook my head, looking away from her, biting
          my tongue till it was sore before I decided to break the silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, for saving my life, for preparing all of this. This has
          been—" My words cut in my throat at the sudden lump that had risen
          there; I didn't know how to finish that sentence, didn't want to say
          something I would regret, so I settled with, "I hope you find someone
          you can willingly give your trust to, even if that person isn't me."
        </p>
        <p>
          She took her eyes off me completely, and the silence that followed was
          deafening to the point that I decided I was done standing there.
        </p>
        <p>
          No effort. She supplied an easy acceptance that had me confirm that I
          was the only one dedicated enough to keeping this relationship afloat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hurt her, <i>maybe</i>. Her expression, though a little flat, gave
          nothing away.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she hurt me...and it was not a <i>maybe</i> feeling, the curling
          and twisting in my chest at the realization that she had chosen
          whatever burden she refused to share over this...over us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt like I had been dating myself for the duration of this
          relationship—like it was always bound to end, and she knew that, so
          there was no point trying to save a sinking ship.
        </p>
        <p>How I didn't see this before was daunting.</p>
        <p>
          Without saying anything, I walked away from her and out of the room,
          closing the door behind me. I stood there for a few minutes before I
          gathered my heavy bearings and walked away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The penthouse was easy to navigate, and I noticed other rooms in it. A
          lot of money had been used to reserve this place for a month. I
          understood why she brought me here.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was trying to save me and do what she thought was right, even if
          she did it wrong. I understood that we all made mistakes, but I failed
          to understand why she would not open up to me as I have done for her.
        </p>
        <p>I needed to know—<i>truly</i> know the woman I had fallen for.</p>
        <p>My heart felt so heavy, and I needed to leave.</p>
        <p>
          There were no guards in the house, and as I moved to the elevator, I
          brought my wrist to my view, aiming to check the time, but my watch
          wasn't around my wrist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it clicked in my head, what exactly I had forgotten to put on.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck."</p>
        <p>The wristwatch. It was still on the bedside table.</p>
        <p>
          I turned and walked back towards the direction of the room, reaching
          there, I only hesitated for a few seconds before pushing the door
          open, letting out a sigh of relief when I couldn't find her in the
          position I had left her, which only meant she had gone to the bathroom
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I locked the door behind me, spotting my wristwatch where I had last
          seen it, and then proceeded to fetch it—putting it around my wrist and
          noting that it was 5 AM, almost dawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          It gave me enough time to figure out what to do with Casmiro and
          Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>I could not let this slide.</p>
        <p>
          Their subordinates would handle their duties. I did not want them in
          the compound. They were too close to me to consider a permanent
          solution to their defiance, and honestly, I did not care enough to
          exact dire punishments—they did, indirectly, try to save my life, but
          that did not excuse the fact that they had carried out something so
          significant because they thought I would not care to know—and of
          course, I would not care to know, I would have most likely ignored,
          still—I would suffice by having them leave the compound until I
          thought it necessary for them to come back.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an order that would not sit well with them; they would hate it,
          and I devised that as the perfect punishment, giving them limited
          access to me—and giving myself the space to get to work without their
          brutal unwanted supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking the wristwatch in place, I made my way back to the entrance,
          but the moment I placed my hand on the knob, a soft sound came from
          behind the bathroom door.
        </p>
        <p>
          It made me halt, frown and listen; I didn't hear myself breathe for
          that second. It seemed as though I stopped my heart from beating to
          make sure what I heard wasn't my mind playing tricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          It came again, a small sniff, a soft sob, uneven
          breathing—<i>crying</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frown fell from my face, and my hand slowly and softly dropped
          from the knob, detesting what I was hearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Fuck</i>—it cut me. The sounds of her crying—it cut me deep, and to
          know I was responsible for that...I did not like it. Not one bit. I
          walked quietly to stand in front of the bathroom door, her crying much
          more audible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I placed my hand on the door handle, wanting to push it open and stop
          those sounds. Stop her crying because it was odd. Zahra does not—this
          was the last thing I expected.
        </p>
        <p>I ground my teeth together so hard the clench in my jaw hurt.</p>
        <p>
          Resigned, I swiftly kicked off my shoes and softly knocked on the
          door. "Zahra, ¿Qué estás haciendo..." I said softly. "Hm?"
        </p>
        <p>The soul-torturing sounds didn't stop.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed, dropping my forehead against the hard surface, closing my
          eyes, and swallowing as emotions channeled through me, decisions
          falling and shattering, my mind discarding affirmations, and taking a
          back seat again, allowing this stupid heart to lead again.
        </p>
        <p>I was so gone.</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra," I called again, pulling my eyes back open, but only her
          crying met my ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was melting my resolve—it <i>already</i> melted my resolve; I could
          barely remember why I had left this room, ending us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm coming in, okay?" I said, waiting a few seconds before I pushed
          open the door and stepped in.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was leaning against the sink top in front of the mirror, hands
          covering her face, shoulders heaving as each sob left her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was crying like she had been spending months holding a lot of
          things in and had only just decided to let them out through tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closing the door behind me, my throat worked again, and I walked over
          to her, seeing the wet streaks flow down the visible parts of her
          cheeks, falling onto my sweater.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know what to say, didn't know how to comfort her, I had never
          been put in a position like this, and it didn't help that it tore me
          to witness this—I was seeing a part of this woman that I never knew I
          would hate to see, it seemed as though she just became even more human
          than she once was.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took another step closer until we were toe to toe, and one of my
          arms curled around her waist, pulling her flush against my body, while
          the other went to the side of her head, caressing her neck beneath her
          ear before my fingers disappeared into the depths of her hair,
          settling on the back of her head as I lured her to rest gently against
          my chest, while I caressed her scalp.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Deja de llorar, por favor." I told her softly before adding, "Seeing
          you like this is breaking my heart, querida."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands broke from between us as she put them around me, letting me
          hold her while she held me, trying to tame the tears, her body shook
          in my arms, and I knew then and there that I might just be a small
          part of the reasons why she was crying, something else was making my
          woman unravel like this before me.
        </p>
        <p>No filter. No barrier.</p>
        <p>I let my hold tighten. "Is this about what I said?"</p>
        <p>No response, more tears while she held me.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed, "I am sorry about tonight." I let the words flow out. "I am
          sorry I hurt you that way; I should not have touched you while I was
          angry."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her grip tightened around me. "I am sorry too," her voice was heavy
          with tears. "for drugging you. That was stupid. I should have told
          you—you everything."
        </p>
        <p>"I know. I know you are sorry."</p>
        <p>
          She sniffed, trying to calm down. "It's just—everything—everything I
          had to do and see today just took, took so much from me. And knowing I
          would be with you at the end of the day—it made me feel relief. But
          I—I fucked that up too."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, "You didn't know, and I didn't mean most things I
          said. I am very comfortable with you," I assured, caressing her scalp,
          "I just needed you to see that it was <i>okay</i> to trust me, even if
          you feel like I would ignore you. I know I have my days, but when have
          I ever ignored anything you truly wanted from me,"
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head, calming down.</p>
        <p>
          "See, next time, just talk to me. Do not take matters into your own
          hands. And this is not just for me alone, anyone at all. For your
          team, what you did was wrong, and I am positive that if you had told
          them you needed them off the ship immediately, they would have
          listened without question because they trust you. But you drugging
          them might have taken that away."
        </p>
        <p>
          She shivered in the after effect from tears, "I know now, I was
          just—I'm not used to—I stopped asking for things years ago. I get what
          I want because asking always—for me—comes with consequences, but I'm
          trying to be better. I am."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know," I responded, "I also know I am not without faults. I should
          not have pushed you to tell me what you were clearly uncomfortable
          with."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled away softly, shaking her head, letting me see her flushed
          cheeks and swollen eyes as she wiped her tears. "No, no, you're right.
          You should know. If we want to take this any further, then you should
          know—you should know me." She met my gaze firmly, "I trust you. I do.
          And I want this to work. I want us to work because I really,
          <i>really</i> care about you." She pursed her lips, "And I might lose
          my eyes, so I gotta lock it in before you can run."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, confused. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I cried over you, and I once said I would stab myself in both
          eyes the day I cried over a guy, so..."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh,"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," her hand covered mine, "Come on," she said, pulling me with
          her as we made our way out of the bathroom and back to the room's
          warmth. "I'm glad you realized your wristwatch was still here."
        </p>
        <p>My frown deepened. Of course, she had noticed.</p>
        <p>Zahra settled on the bed, and I settled beside her.</p>
        <p>"Why didn't you tell me I left my watch while I was leaving?"</p>
        <p>
          "It was expensive." She stated. "I thought I would have a good cry
          and, tomorrow, find a buyer. Get some cash. No regrets."
        </p>
        <p>"I see,"</p>
        <p>
          Silence befell, but it was not awkward. I waited patiently for her to
          tell me what she wanted to reveal.
        </p>
        <p>
          She cleared her throat, unable to meet my gaze as her voice filled the
          space between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You pretty much know the basics. I was born in Saudi Arabia, but
          almost immediately, I was carted off here to the headquarters for
          Italy."
        </p>
        <p>"Headquarters?"</p>
        <p>
          She nodded, "There's this organization; it's secret. I don't know how
          they operate or who runs the show, but they make children—based on
          customer orders, as I learned early on." She said, and a sick twist
          filled my stomach. "It's a pedo ring—children are being made to—to
          pleasure adults, and then later, when they turn 14, they upgrade into
          more...sex trafficking, and every crazed shit that comes with it."
        </p>
        <p>
          She sneaked a glance at me. "That um—that's how I'm here. I am one of
          the donor kids. Not many of us get lucky enough to leave without
          either dying or running and then being found and dying later."
        </p>
        <p>
          I took her hand in mine. "And you have no idea who they are? The
          people behind this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head. "All I know is that it's huge. They have branches
          and headquarters everywhere, and children—ranging from different
          ethnicities. I know I'm of Spain and Saudi Arabian soil; the sperm
          donor must have been from around here, and it was trafficked and taken
          to Saudi Arabia to get a womb donor, so I would—well, look like this.
          It's happening every day. With different people. Different children."
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the most despicable thing I'd ever heard. It made me see red
          that she had gone through this and that there was nothing I could do
          to erase those memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't have a family, background, or place I come from. I don't have
          ties to anywhere in the world. I wasn't made to have ties or roots. I
          have my name though—even if it was given to me to...to suit someone
          else's desires."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart swelled for this woman, sucking in more of her, as I raised
          my hand to tilt her chin and switched to Spanish. "You have a strong
          name, querida. You owned it. And it is very beautiful, just like you
          are...bright, shining, and very—<i>ultimately</i>—brilliant."
        </p>
        <p>A smile curved upon her lips. "Thank you for saying that."</p>
        <p>
          "Not often do I love to speak the truth, but this is one I could not
          keep to myself any longer," I said, brushing her chin to her jawline
          with my knuckles. "Tell me more,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, "As I told you before, Martino saved me, took me out of
          the business. But it didn't erase the fact that I went through that
          shit. I grew up having different—<i>people</i> in my mouth, in my
          body—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I squeezed her hand, and she squeezed mine, too, appreciating the
          comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The houses were built like foster care homes, with children. We have
          two handlers, one a woman and one a man. They take care of the
          children, oversee the adults who visit, take the money, and make sure
          to keep the children happy. My handler at that time was Martino, and
          one Miss Grace, she passed away a couple of years ago."
        </p>
        <p>"Martino was in the business?"</p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "His father was in charge of the house where we lived, and
          he asked Martino to oversee. There was—" She let out a shaky breath.
          "There was a time when he tried to hurt me; I was twelve. It was
          traumatizing, and I should have hated him for it; I should have seen
          him for the monster that he was, but—I thought, I thought he was my
          saving grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even when I was taken to another house, and he promised to find me
          again when I turned 16, I waited every damn day for him to save me. It
          was a long wait, but he did come; he showed up for me. No one had ever
          done that for me, no one had ever loved me the way he did, and that
          easily fooled me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But staying with him, being by his side, being in his bed, being
          <i>used</i> by him was just—it was terrible. He was my worst nightmare
          and my saving grace. I battled with my feelings for years, trying to
          figure out why his love hurt so much. Until I realized it was not
          love. Until he woke up one morning and decided I wasn't what he wanted
          anymore." she swallowed. "He threw me away."
        </p>
        <p>
          The darkness I caught in her eyes was a budding rage I could tell she
          had spent years managing to tame.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He let me go," she said. "What he had for me wasn't love, it was an
          obsession with my body and my face, and he was just done—like he
          couldn't look at me, but even all those times that I still stayed,
          trying to make my decision, I would catch him standing there, just
          watching me. I was confused because he made me feel insecure, and
          enough at the same time, and I had had enough. So I left."
        </p>
        <p>
          And she was quiet, something distant in her eyes, telling me there was
          more after that, but I didn't push.
        </p>
        <p>"Did you love him?"</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head. "No. I wouldn't call what I felt love. It was
          toxic. It was not a happy feeling. It was a feeling of longing for
          something less overbearing. Back then, I thought it was love, and it
          was okay for love to hurt, but after leaving him, I realized that I
          was just in my head, wishing for something that wasn't there."
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking up at me, her eyes searched mine. "What I feel with you, Elio.
          It's different. It's new. It's not toxic, but it's scary because it
          brings out this side of me that I didn't know I had. Sometimes I don't
          recognize myself, but I love it because I feel normal. I feel like
          this is the best side of me. And I'm always eager to see what else I
          can be, do, and feel with you."
        </p>
        <p>That propelled a smile from me.</p>
        <p>
          She returned it, "You still wanna know why I needed STREET off the
          ship?"
        </p>
        <p>"Only if you feel comfortable enough to tell me."</p>
        <p>
          She nodded. "I do." She clarified. "I needed them off because after we
          stopped the elites and the whole massacre of shoot-outs happened, I
          had to help out an old friend. Ashlyn. She was also a donor child. We
          stayed in the same house, but I left earlier than her. She reached out
          to me a couple of weeks ago, and I learned she had somehow managed to
          get out.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had this group of people hunting down houses here in Mexico and
          nearby cities, it's a small secret organization dedicated to saving as
          many children as they can, and she made me swear not to tell a soul
          about it—so well, I'm kinda going back on my word, and this should
          stay between us."
        </p>
        <p>"Of course,"</p>
        <p>
          "She wanted to know if I had any connection with anyone on board this
          ship; after discovering my relation to the Contis', she decided to try
          her luck. I managed to get her in after she informed me that a house
          handler was on the cruise, and she wanted to use him to get back to
          the base to save the kids. They were about eight children in that
          house. It was a swift operation, and we succeeded, then I came back
          here."
        </p>
        <p>I detected no lie in her statement.</p>
        <p>
          "You should have seen them, Elio. They were so young they didn't know
          half of what was happening. It just—it reminded me of how I used to
          be. Clueless and naive."
        </p>
        <p>"But you took part in saving them, and that's a good thing."</p>
        <p>
          She nodded. "Ashlyn's organization is outstanding. But they lack
          resources that would make their jobs better. I wanted to tell her that
          if they needed any help, I'd be happy to help them. I know STREET
          would be too, but if I approach them with this, and they put two and
          two together, they might find out I was a donor child. They might see
          me differently."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I doubt that." I countered immediately. "I don't see you differently.
          You are still the same, Zahra. And I know STREET won't see you
          differently, too. Take those thoughts from your head."
        </p>
        <p>
          A sigh left her. "They're here." She said. "Dead to the world, but
          they occupy the other rooms, and I have much explaining to do, but I
          don't think I'm ready to tell them yet."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And that is okay. I know you will figure something out; you are a
          better liar than I am, after all."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know if that is an insult or a compliment."</p>
        <p>"It was a compliment."</p>
        <p>A small laugh left her.</p>
        <p>
          I brushed her hair back from her face, seeing the tiredness in her
          eyes. I was happy she told me this and confided in me. I knew how much
          it took from her, but somehow, it made me feel closer to her. It made
          us feel more intimate than before.
        </p>
        <p>I leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss to her forehead.</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you for telling me all of this, Zahra. I will conduct a few
          personal research myself, and find out what I can about this
          organization."
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, taking in a shuddered breath. "That would be helpful; they
          really need to be stopped. It has gone on for too long."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I agree," I said, watching her stifle a yawn. "You are tired. You
          should sleep. It is almost daylight; I have to find Casmiro and
          Angelo—"
        </p>
        <p>"I can send them the address here...if you want." She blurted.</p>
        <p>"No, that is all right; I will go."</p>
        <p>
          She sighed, brows dropping at the idea of me leaving, the tiredness
          vanishing. "Can we still—still talk about this? I know you might need
          space after everything, but I don't want us to end, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "I thought we covered that already?"</p>
        <p>
          Her shoulders dropped. "Yeah, I know, but I assumed after we talked
          you might—I don't know—want to reconsider your decision to...break
          up?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I reconsidered my decision when I walked into that bathroom." I
          grazed her cheek softly, "I am still in this with you, Zahra; you
          don't have to worry."
        </p>
        <p>
          She let out a heavy breath. "Next time, just fucking say it out loud.
          I'm not smart enough to read minds."
        </p>
        <p>"I will take note of that."</p>
        <p>
          She leaned in, joining our lips in a tentative kiss, one I fell into
          without second thoughts or second guessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she pulled away, she whispered, "Stay. Please. I will send your
          location to Angelo, and he'll forward it to Casmiro, and we can
          discuss at large in the morning about the painting and everything that
          went down."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't have much fight to object to that, so I stayed, and we lay
          down together like we had been doing for the past week.
        </p>
        <p>
          She spent minutes in my arms, telling me how she would placate her
          team by explaining that she wanted to surprise them with another
          one-month vacation to explore all of Mexico while staying in this
          penthouse she had supposedly rented from personal savings—at some
          point, she had completely relaxed, and at another point, she had
          stopped talking, and her breathing had deepened.
        </p>
        <p>I checked and saw she was already asleep.</p>
        <p>
          Laying there for a while, just watching her, unable to find sleep as
          usual, I pressed a kiss to her hair, detached myself from her, left
          the bed, and put on my shoes.
        </p>
        <p>I quietly left before she woke up.</p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>IN THE </b>vague dream I was having, something was buzzing.
          Continuously, urgent, and distant. It maintained a sequence that just
          stretched on—Non-stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound slowly dragged me out of my sleep daze and back to reality,
          my eyes opening up in sleep, heavy and tired. I groaned into the
          pillow and angrily fussed above the sheet, flinging my body this way
          and that as my groaning grew louder and the buzzing continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a frown that I was almost positive would burn the device, I
          raised myself a little, searching for my phone, and finding it on the
          nightstand at the other side of the bed that was quite cold, very
          neat—<i>I'd woken up alone</i>—my annoyance sank immediately. Worry
          surfaced as I dragged my body to the other side of the bed and picked
          up my phone.
        </p>
        <p><i>Vitale.</i></p>
        <p>
          "What the hell does this fucker want?" I groaned, dropping my body
          back on the bed as I closed my eyes, answered the call, and pressed
          the phone to my ear. "What is it?" I snapped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Where did you keep your phone? I've been calling all morning; do
            you think this is fucking funny?" </i
          >The anger in his voice held a seething tone that had my eyes snapping
          open and my senses on alert. I brought my phone to my view and caught
          that the time was one in the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Placing the phone back to my ear, I rubbed my eyes. "I was asleep; I
          had a rough night. What's going on?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Oh no, sorry to disturb your beauty sleep; nothing really is going
            on, just my </i
          >fucking<i> life being ruined, that's all!" </i>Something shattered
          from his end, telling me he had flung a fragile object to the wall or
          ground.<i></i>
        </p>
        <p>Frowning, I sat up. "What happened?"</p>
        <p>
          A strangled sound left him.
          <i
            >"Everything is ruined, Zahra, every fucking thing—everything I've
            worked my whole life for is gone."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Slow down—slow down, what do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"The seat, Zahra—" </i>he sounded broken, his breathing ragged.
          <i
            >"Eight years, I've worked tirelessly for eight fucking years, and
            now it's gone, slipped away from my hands...eve-everything."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>Oh God.</p>
        <p>
          I got off the bed, unable to stay still, sudden sweat beading at my
          skin inside the hoodie I wore. "I thought you said they didn't take a
          vote until mid-next year? You had all the board and every serpent head
          in your corner; we made sure of that."
        </p>
        <p><i>"We did." </i>He practically growled<i>. "But guess what?"</i></p>
        <p>The menace in his tone ignited goosebumps on my skin. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Somebody suddenly decided to be generous...17 fucking billion
            pounds went in support of my drunkard brother. They ruled him
            in...they're yet to make a final decision, which they informed me
            they would make next week, but we both know who is getting it."
          </i>

        <p>
          <i>"No need for that, there's nothing to undo."</i> He was pacing, he
          was pacing furiously, his breathing unleveled.

          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Vitale, just fucking breathe, we will figure this out—"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"I want him dead, Zahra. He fucking played a bad hand. A terrible

          >

        <p>
          "Continue on that path, and you will be dead before you can even raise
          your gun to shoot him, Vitale," I said, rubbing my head at the
          headache that had begun to surface.
        </p>
        <p>He went quiet, letting out a shuddering breath.</p>
        <p>
          "Listen to me, now is not the time to lose your cool, okay? We can't
          have people see you like this; we've come too far for you to go
          batshit over a little stone in your path; you need to get your shit
          together. Where are you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His breathing was all I heard as he forced out the word.
          <i>"Home." </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Is there anyone there with you?" I asked him.</p>
        <p>
          There was a strained sound from him again, and I knew he was holding
          himself back from completely losing it.
          <i>"People are around, yes." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Go to your room. Now. Align your steps with each breath you take."
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short while, I heard his heavy footsteps and incoherent
          counting, and then a door opened and closed.
        </p>
        <p>"Have you been drinking?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"What the fuck does that have to do with anything?" </i> He snapped
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew out a breath. "Vitale. I am asking because I can hear your
          breathing pattern, and I need to know if you need to take your meds
          now or—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I am fucking fine!" </i>He yelled<i
            >. "My life just got fucking ruined, and you're miles away asking
            about some stupid meds pretending you care if I live or die! You
            don't get to do that, Zahra! You don't get to fuck with me like this
            when you're fucking around with someone else." </i
          >another shatter and a sharp shuffle as if he had left the phone
          elsewhere<i>. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          What followed next was chaos, and I pressed my eyelids close as
          different clashes followed, some shatters, some thuds, angry groans,
          and grunts—more shatters, more and more and more; I didn't even know
          how long it lasted. I just stayed on the line, listening to this man
          who had managed to remain calm 95% of his life—after almost hurting
          someone he cared about—break back into his mind and anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cared so much about himself that he didn't let something as
          day-altering as anger issues mess with him. He got himself help, and
          he was better, better than he used to be, but hearing this, I knew how
          hard the blow of Elio's actions had hit him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hell, even <i>I</i> felt the blow. We had worked our asses off to get
          him to a position above his brother with just wits and cunningness.
        </p>
        <p>Elio...<i>God</i>.</p>
        <p>
          That man had targeted Vitale where he knew it would hurt the most,
          where he knew the damage would create more damage. He didn't kill
          him—no—he was torturing him from the inside out—like he had done
          proper research on what exactly would tip off Vitale and drive him to
          the very brink.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had given him time and space and made him believe he was let off
          the hook with just a primal warning—then he had struck, and he had
          won.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt terrible because I knew how hard and how far Vitale had come to
          be in this place mentally, only to mercilessly break like all his
          growth had meant nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio played his hand well, and he was <i>apparently</i> still playing
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could see it clearly, the way the mind of my boyfriend had worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he instilled shock into Vitale's mind, and then devastation,
          before it slowly progressed into anger, Vitale's only flaw—the one he
          had been burying so deep all these years and was successfully healing
          from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, slowly—ever so slowly, he would lose his mind and play right
          into Elio's trap; he would want to attack. He would give Elio the
          perfect opportunity and excuse to do whatever he pleased without
          retaliation from the Society because then, everyone would know that
          Elio's empire never struck first; Vitale was the one to throw the
          first punch. Therefore, it was within the rights of the Marino empire
          to take him out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clashes and shattering stopped, and only loud, distant breathing
          was heard, one he was trying to tame, one that had slowly turned into
          a tiny wheezing sound that got higher and higher as seconds passed. I
          heard footsteps and hurried movements, drawers opening and slamming
          close until they stopped, and then a strong puff of gas down his
          throat—an inhaler—I knew because he rarely got asthma attacks, but
          whenever he did, it was around the house, within reach. His mother
          would never take that chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I waited a few beats, listening to him calm down, as my nerves did.
        </p>
        <p>
          His calm breathing drew closer, and a slight shuffling followed,
          indicating that he had probably picked up the phone.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you calmer now?"</p>
        <p><i>"Yes."</i></p>
        <p>
          "Good. I know how this looks and how hard you have worked to get this
          far, but you cannot break now. That's not what we do, remember?"
        </p>
        <p><i>"Yes."</i></p>
        <p>
          "Now more than ever, I need you to trust me. There might be nothing we
          can do about it since the money has already been paid, and your
          brother has already been sponsored. But I will talk to Elio and try to
          get him off your back. If you attack, I guarantee you're the only one
          who will leave scathed."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"I can't just let this slide. If he wants to play a game, he must
            know I am happy to play too."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "He knows that, and that is exactly why you will lose. Let
          it go, Vitale. Let the position go."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shot out a laugh that was born from withheld anger.
          <i>"Have you lost your mind?"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I am saying you can get something even better." I allowed my
          words to sink in. "Do you want to be the one that's voted in? Or the
          person who approves and makes the final verdict on who gets voted in?"
        </p>
        <p>Silence, and I knew I had caught his interest.</p>
        <p><i>"What do you mean?" </i></p>
        <p>
          "If we get that flash drive, we hold the power over your family name;
          we hold every secret the current Serpent head has tried to keep from
          the public eye. With your power, my power, and your pending
          inheritance, we can take him out and put you higher than your enemies,
          and then you could even choose to do whatever you want with your
          brother."
        </p>
        <p><i>"That sounds too good to be possible." </i></p>
        <p>
          "It's not impossible. Not impossible for me, or you. I need you to
          trust me, Vitale."
        </p>
        <p><i>"For how long?" </i></p>
        <p>
          "As long as it takes. If you want something this good—this
          farfetched—you have to be patient and observe. I know you would hate
          to hear this, but you should learn a thing or two from Elio. Study
          your enemies, know exactly where to hit them, and make them bend to
          your will. It is not time to let your emotions take over. It is time
          to watch and bid."
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed. <i>"Okay...I hear you."</i> I could almost see him running
          a gloved hand down his face. <i>"Fuck, my room is a mess."</i>
        </p>
        <p>"Your seven minutes of madness is to blame. Deal with it."</p>
        <p>
          <i>"I was going to," </i>he gritted out.
          <i>"I didn't say that so you could comment." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever, I'll call you if I have any news. Call me if something
          happens."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Yeah," </i></p>
        <p>
          I ended the call and immediately found Elio's number and placed a call
          to him. It rang and rang and rang, with no answer, until the line
          disconnected. I tried again—the same thing, and then I tried the third
          time—it rang twice before he declined it.
        </p>
        <p>"Motherfucker."</p>
        <p>
          I made my way out of the room to check on STREET—upon reaching the
          rooms where I had been sure they'd been last night, each one was
          empty.
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck?"</p>
        <p>
          The penthouse was too quiet. After searching for a few minutes, I
          registered in my head that no one was there and I was alone.
        </p>
        <p><i>Where the hell did they go?</i></p>
        <p>
          Fear flashed in my insides, and I quickly reached for my phone and
          dialed Milk's number. It rang about five times before; thankfully, she
          picked up, and I spoke first.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, what's up? Where are you guys?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Hi!" </i>she cheered, heaving a breath; distant sounds of people
          chattering met my ears.

            >"We're at some adoption home under refurbishment, and I'm currently
            scrubbing toilets. There are so many black molds on the ground, and

          </i>
        </p>

        <p>
          "Who didn't—wait, you guys are supposed to be resting—what

        </p>
        <p><i>"Is that Zahra?"</i> Elio's voice sounded from the background.</p>
        <p><i>"Yup." </i>Milk answered.</p>
        <p><i>"Give me the phone; I will talk to her." </i></p>
        <p>
          A little shuffling and his voice became more pronounced.
          <i>"Zahra."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "There better be a good fucking explanation for why you declined my

            little too dark, and I could not see it because the sun was
            affecting it—and by accident, I declined instead of answering."

            apple of my eye."

        </p>
        <p>"What—"</p>
        <p><i>"See you soon." </i></p>
        <p>
          The call disconnected, leaving me standing there, my heart swelling
          and my cheeks growing warm at the term he used.
        </p>
        <p><i>Always manages to leave me speechless—this man.</i></p>
        <p>
          The location was sent shortly after, and I got to work getting ready
          to see what was happening.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          It was proper chaos—okay, maybe not exactly chaos—but people were this
          way and that, some on ladders, some pulling in furniture, some working
          on rooms I could only peek into to see what was happening. I almost
          bumped into someone carrying a bowl of black—oil?
        </p>
        <p>I looked around, confused beyond belief.</p>
        <p>
          <br />A new set of furniture came in, grey couches held by some
          stranger and Upper, who looked like he had been dragged from hell to
          do hard labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a swift glance my way, a crazed smile touched his lips. "Oh, hey
          Zahra, you will <i>bloody</i> pay for this," he said all through with
          a pained smile that didn't leave his face as he and the stranger
          disappeared into another corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the—" I blinked, my gaze zeroing somewhere far off, on a ladder;
          Dog stood at the height of it, with a paintbrush in his grip,
          shirtless, with only jean pants on, body stained with grey paint, a
          rolled up joint tucked in place on his ear, with a permanent frown on
          his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't see Milk and Devil, but I knew from the phone call that Milk
          would be in the restroom areas, and Devil should be around here
          somewhere—
        </p>
        <p>"Sport," Elio's voice had me spinning around.</p>
        <p>
          He was in a typical black button-up, untucked from his pants and
          rolled to his elbows. His hair was a bit rough, but it still somehow
          looked well-kempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes took me in swiftly, lingering on my shorts as his gaze grew
          darker. "Welcome; I appreciate you adhering to the clothing code."
        </p>
        <p>
          I wore a faded black t-shirt and sweat shorts that stopped mid-thigh,
          and my hair—let's not even go there.
        </p>
        <p>"Right, what is happening—"</p>
        <p>
          "Come with me; I will explain." He said, brushing past me down a
          corner where I spotted Devil by the side, conversing with about three
          people and jotting things down on the note-pad he held.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked equally tired and stressed, and when our gazes locked, he
          frowned, shook his head, and looked away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, obviously, they're all angry. I already knew I had some
          explaining to do, but first, I needed to figure out what exactly I
          would be explaining for and what in the fuck was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio entered a small office, still holding the door open as I shot him
          a wary look and walked past him into the almost empty space, safe for
          a small table and chair in the middle, filled with papers and a framed
          group picture of children.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I heard the door close, I turned—and was immediately attacked by
          lips on mine, hands on my body, with my back being pressed against the
          table, one hand holding my waist firm, one knee separating my legs as
          his mouth ravaged mine in a kiss that had my heart racing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shock at the sudden change of situation lasted about a few seconds
          before my mind forgot my apprehension as to what was happening around
          me, and I gave in to the pull of him, fisting the collar of his shirt
          and pulling him closer to me, parting my lips open for his tongue to
          swiftly swirl in to taste mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          His muscular thigh rubbed against my center purposefully, building up
          pressure as a small thud continued to build and build until the
          wetness between my legs seemed to flow, aching for his touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coldness of his rings pressed against the side of my neck as we
          slanted, deepening the kiss, a groan from him and a breathy moan from
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My nipples hardened to solid buds. I pressed my body flush against his
          chest and felt his hardness against my belly while I tangled my
          fingers into his hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were joined together like we hadn't spent almost all of last night
          being together.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pulled apart to catch our breaths, and his beautiful hooded eyes
          locked with mine as he breathed out in a ragged rasp filled with
          arousal, "Hi,"
        </p>
        <p>I smiled, astonished. "Hi,"</p>
        <p>
          His lips went to my neck, and he kissed softly down to my throat and
          over to the other side of my neck like he was apologizing to it for
          the light bruising that still showed there due to his roughness last
          night.
        </p>
        <p>
          One that had cut me deep to the point that I spent minutes in the
          bathroom fighting down panic and telling myself that he was just angry
          and did not mean to be so hard on me—it hurt me, but I knew who he was
          and knew the person he was last night—wasn't him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not hate him for it; I just hated how it made me feel. What it
          reminded me of.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I'd forgiven him—his hug restored every doubt I had, and I trusted
          him. I trusted him, and one day, when all is said and done, I'll give
          him the last piece of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing one last kiss to my neck, he returned his face to my view. "I
          really want you, but here's not the place."
        </p>
        <p>"Here's a perfect place for me."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm," he drawled in a deep groan, the sound vibrating from his chest
          as he shook his head. "The walls are thin, and I desire to make you
          scream."
        </p>
        <p>I smiled, "You really are horny, aren't you?"</p>
        <p>
          He took my hand that was fisting his shirt and brought it down to the
          hard bulge in his pants, leaning in to whisper against my lips,
          "Very." he took my lips in his again, kissing me softly and slowly,
          sucking and working my lips as I undid his fly, and his hand escaped
          into the elastic band of my sweat shorts, and inside my underwear,
          touching me where I was soaked and wet and aching.
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips still moved tentatively over mine, in accordance with his
          fingers spreading the wetness from my opening up and down my clit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him when he broke the kiss, bringing his fingers out of my
          shorts and removing the two rings around them before getting the
          fingers to his lips, sucking swiftly, and making them wetter before he
          slid his hands back into my shorts and underwear, circling my swollen
          clit in a motion that made my hips buck and my lips part—a sweet
          feeling that rose as he rubbed my clit in a pattern that made my heart
          squeeze in pleasure, loving how he knew the right way to pleasure me.
          A soft sound left my throat, and he slipped both fingers into me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He collected my gasp by taking my lips again, his fingers pumping
          slowly in and out of me—it felt so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          With slight difficulty, I slid his hard length out of his briefs, his
          warm skin perfect and rigid against my grip as I stroked him, my hand
          giving attention to the head of his cock, as he leaked out precum that
          aided lubrication up and down his shaft.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were quiet, kissing softly but lazily without focus, our hands
          working on each other—slight hitch of breaths from either him or me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When his fingers increased tempo, pumping in and out of me, I followed
          the same sequence with my stroking, and we broke the kiss apart, his
          forehead resting on mine as we breathed through our mouths, feverish
          and intimate with our movements. Completely concealed between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sounds he made were low and lust-filled, his lashes beautifully
          down, watching my hand stroke him and the highlights of his hand
          inside my shorts.
        </p>
        <p>He was so hard and, like me, so close to the edge.</p>
        <p>
          We made it last longer to enjoy the pleasure we gave each other.
          Still, the force at which he began pumping his fingers into me had my
          knees buckling, my hips meeting his thrust. My stomach was woven so
          tight, alongside my clit, and I was shuddering before him at how good
          it felt—it didn't take long before my walls gripped his fingers tight,
          and I was coming all over them, a moan escaping my lips, my legs
          growing so weak, standing becoming a chore as I gripped his shirt, my
          cries breaking as I rode his fingers down my high.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was a little calm but still in a daze from my release, he took
          his fingers out of me and brought them to his lips, licking them
          clean, before bringing his lips to mine in a kiss that had me tasting
          myself on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His tongue tasted like me, and he tasted like mine, and I got drunk on
          it, on him, before he pulled his lips from mine, and I watched him, my
          hands still moving against his hardness. "This was not what I planned,
          coming here today."
        </p>
        <p>"I loved your shorts a lot." He admitted.</p>
        <p>"Really?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. I love whatever you wear." He admitted again, his stare deep and
          piercing. "I love whatever you do, and however you look. Drives me
          crazy every time, and I love it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, going down on my knees before him, and raised my gaze as
          hooded eyes looked back down at me while I took him in my mouth,
          earning a groan with his hands to my hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sucking and twirling my tongue around the head of his cock, I took him
          as far deep as he could go, letting my tongue lay flatly down my mouth
          to aid his thick length further down as I hollowed the inside of my
          mouth, sucking him to fervent curses.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was so undone, fighting to be quiet as I worked on him, cared for
          him, and teased him with my tongue the way he liked.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fingers caressed my scalp in silent appreciation as I moved up and
          down his length, his thickness filling my mouth, his taste driving my
          senses wild—I wanted him inside me; I wanted to get tangled up on a
          sheet with him until I didn't know where my body began and where it
          ended.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to make love to him, fuck him, ride him, suck him, touch him,
          kiss him, take him till I was sore and broken, I wanted to own him,
          and I wanted so very much for him to own me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew he was already so close, but I tried to edge him a bit before
          letting him hit the back of my throat—in a few thrusts, his orgasm
          struck, spurts of cum shot down my throat, and I dutifully swallowed.
          I loved it; I loved getting on my knees for him and having him in my
          mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved that <i>I</i> got to do this and not someone else. Sometimes,
          I wished I could read the minds of all the women who ogled him
          whenever we were in a public place; I needed to know who exactly I
          would be plucking their eyeballs.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got to my feet again, we kissed as he tucked himself back in,
          putting his arm around me—so mundane, so natural.
        </p>
        <p>My heart was racing just being close to this man like this.</p>
        <p>
          He broke the kiss but didn't let go of me. "I missed you all morning,
          but I did not want to disturb...I knew you were tired."
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand on his biceps picked out invisible lint from his shirt, "Did
          you even get to sleep?"
        </p>
        <p>"Hm, no. but I plan to sleep tonight."</p>
        <p>
          "You shouldn't plan to sleep; you should sleep every night; it's what
          normal people do."
        </p>
        <p>"I am not normal people,"</p>
        <p>
          I raised a brow, "What? You got some superpower I don't know about?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes..." he drawled.</p>
        <p>"What is it?"</p>
        <p>"I know how to make you squeal."</p>
        <p>"W—"</p>
        <p>
          He lifted me suddenly, and a loud squeal left my mouth as he dropped
          me on the table, placing himself between my legs.
        </p>
        <p>"That was so fucking cheesy."</p>
        <p>
          A smile gently curved at his lips, lighting up his eyes as soft voice
          spoke, "It made you squeal, did it not?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes, "It did," I played with the collar of his shirt, his
          gaze lingering on me like he couldn't look away. "What?" I asked; his
          stare wasn't unnerving, just—heavy, so heavy it made me feel heavy
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are adorable," he answered, and the compliment went straight to
          my chest, making it all fluffy and weird, like I was elevating or
          something. I didn't even know why my toes wanted to curl.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, I wanted to shy away from his gaze, "What's up with
          you today?" I asked with a smile of my own, one I couldn't even stop
          from forming on my lips if I tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and wrapped his arms around my body until we were
          pressed together. He buried his head in the crook of my neck,
          breathing me in deeply. "Zahra," he called my name softly, in a small,
          breathy way that told me he wasn't calling for me to answer him; he
          was just saying my name like he was sinking into the very essence of
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Against my chest, I could feel the fast pacing of his heart, wild and
          raging, a replica of mine, but his was so fierce that it had me
          falling even deeper into him—<i>for him</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This felt good; a comfortable silence of him holding me, so warmly, so
          intimately, like it would break him to pull away—right now, a lot was
          unsaid, but plenty was shown. Plenty was felt, and I allowed my body
          to grow soft against his, wrapping my arms around him and letting the
          feelings take charge of the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was falling for this man, without sequence, without grip, a freefall
          that came with fear, passion, and something mind-twinkling—but for the
          first time since I felt this soft connection with him, I didn't pull
          away, I pulled in. because I needed this feeling, I craved it like a
          food for my soul—a secret potion to keep me sane and functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a fever of a moment, all was forgotten—the reason I had set a
          course for this journey, my life before I met him—before I
          <i>knew</i> him—was forgotten. All I wanted right now was to be in his
          arms, stay here, and let him kiss my flaws back to perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I let myself free-fall into him until my mind knew
          nothing—absolutely nothing, but him.

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>IT BAFFLED </b>me how he successfully diverted my attention from
          why I was here and what was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I didn't want to leave his warm embrace, we needed to talk about
          his active pact to destroy Vitale and why he had my friends working on
          this building.
        </p>
        <p>I pulled away softly from him, catching his gaze.</p>
        <p>
          "You have just realized that we need to talk," Elio stated like he
          knew whatever charm he had placed me under had now worn off.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, what's going on?" I asked as he pulled further back, hands still
          on my waist.
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched me carefully, trying to work out my mood before speaking.
          "Right before you drugged me, you had been trying to get STREET back
          into the quest with my own team. You thought it would be better to
          work together."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, eyeing him warily and wondering where he was leading.</p>
        <p>
          "Good. I recall myself telling you that I already had it in control,
          though it might take weeks to collect, and you told me we did not have
          that much time—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, yes, Elio, you don't have to repeat our whole conversation; I
          have a really sharp memory."
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned, amusement in his eyes. "I apologize; I was under the
          impression that you sometimes lose vital information from your memory
          bank. I will make sure not to make any assumption of that sort in the
          near future."
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile was not genuine, and I wanted to connect my forehead to his
          nose but held back. "It's the way you insult me and still sound polite
          while you do."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, "Yes, I have that skill," he raised a hand to graze my
          cheek. "I love it when you are observant about little things
          pertaining to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, I love it too; I'm also very observant of the fact that in about
          2 minutes, you might sustain a nose injury if you don't cut the shit
          and start talking."
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips tugged at the side, but he didn't comment further as he
          continued, "Right before I was about to be assassinated along with
          Kareem, I told you I would have the painting and the gold delivered to
          you once I collected it. To which you responded, and I quote, 'No one
          takes care of our business for us; we like the hustle.' In my mind,
          unbeknownst to you, I formulated a plan that could satisfy the both of
          us without quarrel."
        </p>
        <p>I watched him with a calculating frown. "What plan?"</p>
        <p>"I already have the painting in possession."</p>
        <p>My eyes widened. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Kareem was very kind as to grant me the ownership of the manor
          earlier than expected; a threat was made on his life, and the poor man
          did not anticipate how important that manor is to me and—now to many
          people." He drew away ultimately, walking around the table to sit on
          the chair behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spun around, ignoring the clouds of suspicion covering the
          fluffiness I'd gotten earlier. "What are you talking about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched his eyes shine with pride—a pride that I was sure grew from
          whatever scheme he had concocted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The victim file you found when you infiltrated the condo of the
          assassins sent to kill me; how accurate was my file?"
        </p>
        <p>I blinked, my mind pausing. "Too accurate,"</p>
        <p>
          "Correct." He said, "The Marino empire does not have a mole—It would
          not <i>dare</i> to have a mole because I provide them anything they
          want and more and because they know I will know if they dared to cross
          me. The only person who could have delivered the information I wanted
          to buy the manor would have been Casmiro, Angelo—or Me."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't understand."</p>
        <p>
          "I will break it down, Sport, have a seat." He motioned to the chair
          by the far end; I pulled it closer till it was opposite him and then
          settled on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you did not know this about me, I do not like making noise. I
          <i>despise</i> it. I love sticking to my business so no one would feel
          the need to know my business." He said. "My father was loud. I am
          quiet. Being too loud is often known to be careless. But when you are
          silent and use your head instead of a gun, you tend to breeze in and
          out of chaos unaffected."
        </p>
        <p>Something clicked in my mind. "The school bus incident?"</p>
        <p>
          "You are very sharp indeed." He commended. "The news about the
          painting and the quest was splashed across all media channels. It got
          people to start digging, even though it had later been cleared to the
          public that it was nothing but an elaborate miscommunication and a
          scheme to make money—not everyone bought it. It was a big mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arturo's adopted son, Chika, had paid several media houses to cover
          the story, throwing off the original people searching for the painting
          so that he could get to it before anyone else did. He had figured out
          where it was when he landed here in Mexico. But I'd had people take
          care of him before he could do even more damage."
        </p>
        <p>"You didn't kill Chika?"</p>
        <p>
          "Only a few people are worth my bullet. He was not worth my bullet. I
          had my people do it. I had them question him too because I was too
          busy stopping the governor from having a heart attack while chaos
          ensued in his city, thanks to you and your team."
        </p>
        <p>
          I became uncomfortable, "So you mean—it isn't just you who knows that
          I—about how I brought him in?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," he answered. "But you need not worry. That is neither their
          concern nor their verdict to judge. They only passed information I
          asked them to retrieve."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right...right...how does this pertain to Kareem and the assassins?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A lot of noise had been made, so it was only a matter of time before
          someone randomly pieced in two and two together and discovered the
          valid location of the original painting. What better way than to be
          the person who schemed the first chaos?
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to buy the manor, knowing it would take weeks to secure.
          Kareem, while kind, was too slow. He would have loved to peel me open,
          to make me a friend before his association with me was severed. I did
          not need friendship; I only needed his signature. I did not desire to
          cause him any harm, but I also needed to speed up the process and take
          it on without noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was unsure what you and your team had planned, but I had a gut
          feeling it would have backfired, and one of you would have gotten
          hurt. So—I found myself some assassins—or better yet, one anonymous
          buyer had found them and promised them a lot of money to assassinate
          Kareem and the person who wants to buy the painting."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blanked out slowly, my head working, piecing things together, how
          his whole demeanor had changed when I informed him I needed STREET
          back on the mission. He was quick to dismiss the idea; also, last
          night—how I had informed him of the assassins, and he was more
          concerned that I had drugged him and hadn't trusted him enough to tell
          him. He did not even further ask about their origin or why—if they'd
          been after the manor's owner—they would want him dead or the other two
          men they had gotten victim files on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio had clearly stated that I wouldn't have needed to drug him if I
          had told him, but I had taken it all in stride as he usual
          ignorance—and his chase for death—I did not think it was because he
          was already aware, but still—some pieces did not fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why would you hire assassins to kill Kareem if you didn't want to
          cause him any harm?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "They were not to touch Kareem, just the other men with him. Those
          ones were already planning to take him out, and while I would not care
          on occasion, Kareem had shown me nothing but kindness and trust and
          even offered to pray for me for no reason. It was my way of helping
          him without his knowledge and getting my hands on the manor and that
          painting as soon as possible."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But you told me it would take weeks before you secure ownership. Why
          would you wait for weeks if you wanted to get the manor as soon as you
          could?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I answered based on the way you phrased your question. You asked me
          how long the buying process would take, not how long it would take for
          me to get the painting—and I lied by omission and told you it was a
          gut feeling telling me it was all right to wait weeks because I did
          not want noise, and because I was not aware you were aware of the
          assassins." He clarified, "If you had told me—or if Casmiro and Angelo
          had <i>deigned</i> to inform me, the events that followed could have
          been avoided."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "That goes both ways. If you had told me about the
          assassins, I wouldn't have had to drug you and be scared for your
          fucking life." My voice increased in pitch. "And you were so angry at
          me and almost broke things off with me, for what—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do not misinterpret this, Zahra," his tone was sharp as he sat up. "I
          was not angry because you tried to save my life—no—I was angry because
          you drugged me, and at that time, I was clueless as to why you did it.
          You hadn't exactly been forthcoming when divulging information; what
          the hell was I supposed to feel?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I clenched my jaw, looking away while trying to suppress my anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a long silence, he sighed, leaning and reaching for my hand. I
          looked over at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, I don't want to fight with you, we have crossed this issue.
          While I was angry that you drugged me, I was not lying when I told you
          I appreciated your taking the initiative to save my life. According to
          how it all turned out, the assassins had ventured off course because
          the plan was to attack when we were touring the manor. I needed to
          taint that place for Kareem so he would let it go quicker than he
          could say he loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I noticed the formation at that party, I knew something was
          wrong, and I wanted to observe, so I left the crowd. If you hadn't
          intervened and I had fleshed out their new strategy, I would have
          gotten you and STREET out of there before they brought out their guns.
          The lesson here is that a lot could have been prevented with trust
          from my end and yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from that, I planned this because I knew it could only get
          worse, and I knew my brother was involved—I knew <i>you</i> were
          involved alongside the people you both cared about. That was why I
          wanted it to happen on my terms. I did not want any more chaos that
          would endanger your lives. I do not want to live through that any more
          than I have had to, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          I softened my features, "I understand. But why would you include
          yourself to be assassinated?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We both know a threat to Kareem's life would not go unnoticed by
          anyone. I did not want any loose ends. So I took the liberty of taking
          myself off the suspect list." He said, "In a way, I am glad you had
          intervened because I would most likely be dead if you hadn't. Loyalty
          changed with the people my disguised-self had hired...or maybe it was
          greed after they discovered what they could gain if they worked alone.
          They would have killed anyone who got in their way, and I wouldn't
          have seen it coming because I underestimated them."
        </p>
        <p>"And Kareem? The men who are after him?"</p>
        <p>
          "I was kind to tell him about it. His people will deal with them. But
          that chapter is closed with me, and the manor is now on Marino soil.
          No one would infiltrate the building even if the painting had been
          there."
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed, "You really went to great lengths to stop STREET from
          doing any work."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For your protection, Zahra. It would have been a blood bath if I
          hadn't intervened. Dangerous people were after that painting, and now,
          we have to be more guarded because finding the painting is just a
          scratch to this quest. Finding the gold from the map would be much
          worse. Eyes are on us, and they are following. People with lust for
          money and dangerous people who hunger for the power those flash drives
          would give them."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, "I know...but why do you have STREET working here?"</p>
        <p>
          He relaxed his shoulders. "Like I reminded you earlier. You told me
          you all liked to hustle for what you want. Since I have the painting
          and decided to bring your team back on the hunt for the gold, this
          minor work they are doing should be able to cover up the ego talk
          about working hard to gain something. In other words, it covers the
          stress you would have endured to retrieve the painting."
        </p>
        <p>"My God."</p>
        <p>
          "I was merely working on the information you provided me. You should
          thank me because I told them I was in on the plan to get them to the
          penthouse as a surprise, and if they wanted to get the final piece of
          that surprise, they would have to work for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So now they are probably angry because they think I am making them
          work for the surprise."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. Not if you grab a mop and a bucket to assist Milk in the toilet.
          A show of good friendship."
        </p>
        <p>I rolled my eyes, "You are impossible."</p>
        <p>He nodded as if I had given him a title he would never forget.</p>
        <p>"Why this building, though?"</p>
        <p>
          "I came across it in listings of several houses needing a donation.
          This one was far worse and in dire need of refurbishment. And thanks
          to a good Samaritan, I learned recently that there might be precisely
          eight children in need of a home and proper medical care."
        </p>
        <p>My heart stuttered. "What?"</p>
        <p><i>The children Ashlyn and I rescued with her team. </i></p>
        <p>
          "I did not confront her." he informed, "I am hoping you will relay the
          information that you found a perfect home for them while they heal
          from the mental stress of what that organization put them through."
        </p>
        <p>
          I calmed instantly, not knowing exactly what to say to show how much
          his thoughtfulness made me feel, so I got up, went around the table,
          sat on his lap, and hugged him. "You don't know how much this means to
          me."
        </p>
        <p>His arm came around me. "I am glad I can help in some way."</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," I pulled away, smiling at him, eyes searching his pretty
          relaxed ones, "You're giving them a home—it's so generous."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is not enough. I am still asking around, seeking information. Once
          I do find out the people doing this, they will pay."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have no doubt, as long as you include me in whatever you're
          planning,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He cupped my face in his hand, "I wouldn't have anyone else fighting
          by my side, Zahra, trust me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined my lips with his to further show my appreciation. It wasn't a
          kiss filled with hunger or lust, but it made me feel light.
        </p>
        <p>When I broke away, I looked around. "Whose office is this?"</p>
        <p>"The manager."</p>
        <p>"So not yours."</p>
        <p>"Not mine."</p>
        <p>I grinned. "We managed to christen a place that isn't ours."</p>
        <p>
          He tilted his head, "Hm, not the way I would have liked, but yes,
          there is a point there."
        </p>
        <p>"Who knew you would be this naughty."</p>
        <p>"It's all you. Your effect on me. You make me insatiable."</p>
        <p>"That is an honor."</p>
        <p>He nodded, "It is, I must admit. Wear it proud."</p>
        <p>
          I laughed, "Where's Cassie and Angie, anyway? I didn't see them
          around."
        </p>
        <p>
          A frown dragged his brows down. "They have been dismissed from their
          duties."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him.  "You cannot dismiss your underboss or your
          consigliere."
        </p>
        <p>"Says who?"</p>
        <p>"That's like the normal etiquette code thingy of the mafia?"</p>
        <p>
          "Mafia?" he frowned, "While people use that term, I love to call my
          family an empire. Holds more weight."
        </p>
        <p>
          I dismissed that. "You know it's not their fault. You should have told
          them your plans—they worried about you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would have told them before it happened. I had plans to tell them—"
        </p>
        <p>"And you wouldn't have gotten the chance to either way."</p>
        <p>"That is correct."</p>
        <p>"So why punish them for a whole scheme that went underway?"</p>
        <p>
          His eyes narrowed, something cunning lingering in them. "I suppose
          you're right. But they still have to learn lessons from it. If I were
          some other boss who found out their most trusted—even though he
          doesn't show it—had kept something as grievous as that from him, they
          would be dead." he said, "But I know Angelo's mother, and Casmiro's
          family, and I swore to them that I would protect my own, I will not go
          back on my word. Therefore, they have to accept the little
          punishment."
        </p>
        <p>"Until when."</p>
        <p>"Until I am ready."</p>
        <p>"Ready for what?" I frowned, "To forgive them?"</p>
        <p>
          He watched me but did not answer. A long minute passed until I
          understood what he was doing.
        </p>
        <p>"Ignoring my question?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"I hate you sometimes,"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." He shot me a knowing look, his hand rubbing up and down my back.
          "You don't."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You did say it was okay to be delusional." I said, "Now that I'm
          here, I might as well broach the topic. There's something I wanted to
          discuss with you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips pressed against my chin as he pulled me closer to his body,
          "What is it?"
        </p>
        <p>"I got a call from my friend...Vitale."</p>
        <p>
          He paused his movement; even his breathing stopped momentarily as he
          raised his head to look at me—A frown. A deep, hard, menacing scowl
          blessed his face and made me swallow down the nerves that had suddenly
          clawed up my throat.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't like it," he said.</p>
        <p>"You don't like what?"</p>
        <p>
          "His name on your lips, I do not like it. If you want to broach a
          topic about him, refer to him as something else. Not his name."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "Why shouldn't I use his name?"</p>
        <p>
          His eyes hardened, clearly hating that I chose to fight him on his
          request—no—<i>demand</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It gives him more meaning, and I am very uncomfortable with that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay..." I blinked, needing him calm to even bring this up.
          "Okay...I'll—uh—I don't know what exactly to refer him as—"
        </p>
        <p>"That man. Just say that man, don't say his name."</p>
        <p>"Okay—"</p>
        <p>"Make the conversation snappy because I do not want to be angry."</p>
        <p>
          I gave a sharp nod, "Right." Then I frowned, "Did something else
          happen? Why—why do you hate him so much?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't hate him. I would not spare a lesser man that kind of
          emotion. He irritates me. And he held you—roughly, unapologetically,
          and I promised myself I would kill him. And I will."
        </p>
        <p>"I mean—"</p>
        <p>
          "He also left a scar on you, and he's still breathing. And you still
          talk to him. I do not want to portray myself as possessive because you
          are your own woman, but I will not deny that your constant
          communication with him bothers me." 
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, "There is absolutely nothing for you to worry about with
          Vit—"
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra," he warned.</p>
        <p>
          "<i>That man</i>—sorry—you have nothing to worry about; he's just a
          part of my past—"
        </p>
        <p>"That you still talk to."</p>
        <p>
          I smoothed my hand over his shoulder, "He was not a bad part of my
          past, Elio; in fact, we were good friends, and he showed me what
          normal felt like. He hated Martino as much as I did."
        </p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "Martino and V—<i>that man's</i> brother, Ignazio—made his life a
          living, breathing hell. Aside from being bullied to near death, they
          deprived him of everything good—just for fun. Ignazio is a terrible
          person and doesn't deserve that seat you sponsored him in."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio raised a brow, "So he asked you to talk to me? Get me to change
          my mind?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. There's nothing we can do now. But I know that move you pulled
          wasn't your last—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, it was not my last. That bruise lasted three days on your arm. I
          have barely started dealing with that man; when I am done, he would be
          too dead to be dead."
        </p>
        <p>I do not even want to know what that means.</p>
        <p>
          "He didn't offend me, Elio. He doesn't deserve that. Trust me, he
          just—the bruise didn't even hurt me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am glad it didn't. But that does not excuse the painful fact that
          seeing it on your arm for those three days hurt me. Do you know how
          much willpower it takes to ignore killing someone who is supposed to
          be dead? The mental stress it caused me, who will pay for that? hm?"
        </p>
        <p>"Come on, it's not that deep."</p>
        <p>
          "His disgusting hand gripped your arm <i>deeply</i>. Yes, it is that
          deep."
        </p>
        <p>I bit back a laugh, and he caught it.</p>
        <p>
          "This is not funny." He clarified. "I do not like that you are trying
          to vouch for that man."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not vouching for him; I'm just letting you know he's not worth
          the trouble. Trust me, leave him be; you'll have more peace of mind
          when you do."
        </p>
        <p>"Were you involved with him?"</p>
        <p>The question took me off guard. "What?"</p>
        <p>"Before...were you and him...intimate?"</p>
        <p>
          He watched me intently, and upon my silence, something dark crossed
          his eyes. "You were."
        </p>
        <p>"Only once," I blurted out, "and it did not mean anything to me."</p>
        <p>"What about him?"</p>
        <p>
          I sucked in a breath from my parted lips, letting it out with a
          response. "Not anymore,"
        </p>
        <p>"You do not sound sure."</p>
        <p>"Elio, it happened years ago—"</p>
        <p>
          "But you still speak with him, knowing he might harbor feelings for
          you. You care about him—"
        </p>
        <p>"Baby, the only person I care about romantically is you."</p>
        <p>
          That shut him up—in fact—his whole body froze beneath me. Was it from
          me using that endearment or from my declaration? I wasn't sure, but it
          had the tip of his ears grow a shade redder as he cleared his throat
          and shifted on the seat as if he didn't know what to do with himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," he started, looking everywhere but at me. "I already made my
          decision. I will make him suffer, and then I will kill him."
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, Elio—what if it upsets me?"</p>
        <p>His gaze snapped to mine. "Do not threaten me like that."</p>
        <p>
          "It's not a threat. It will upset me because the only good thing in my
          present is killing the mildly good thing in my past."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What if the good thing in your present wants to be the only good
          thing in your life and in your future, and in order for him to be
          sane, he has to kill the mildly good thing in your past so that you
          can see and know him as the only solid good thing that ever happened
          to you."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, you lost me."</p>
        <p>
          "I will not change my mind. If I let him go, he will not learn his
          lesson."
        </p>
        <p>
          "He already learned his lesson, okay? He's pretty fucked up right now
          and very angry."
        </p>
        <p>"Precisely what I wanted."</p>
        <p>
          "Let him go...please, for me—for little old me who you
          <i>really</i> care about and would hate to anger because she would not
          let it go and would most likely bug you till your ears bleed and you
          have no other choice but to do her bidding when you could have just
          accepted while she asked nicely?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, shaking his head as the frown slowly slipped off his face.
          "Promise me he won't be of interference with us because then I will
          not wait to make him suffer. I will just kill him. In cold blood, I
          would make sure I don't use a gun so that I can feel his life slipping
          away with my bare hands."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed. "I promise. Your pretty little heart is safe with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is?" he asked, the hint of a different meaning passing between us.
        </p>
        <p>"It is. Completely safe."</p>
        <p>He nodded. "Good. I will call off the hit on his mother."</p>
        <p>"Jesus—"</p>
        <p>
          His lips covered the loudness of my voice as he hugged me to his body
          possessively. When he broke away, his eyes searched mine. "No more
          talks of that man. It upsets me."
        </p>
        <p>"Duly noted."</p>
        <p>
          He supplied me with a firm nod. "Would you like to see the children
          the ones you rescued will be staying with?" 
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          They were playing outside the expansive backyard; many booths had been
          set out for them to play different games, get healthy snacks, or get
          face paints and all colorful things. The tiny voices, innocent
          laughter escaping through several braced teeth and several ones with a
          few gaps here and there, filled me with a peace I had never once
          experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the side, clowns made children laugh, and a small kids band was
          also close to that area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A huge fort was made close to the building in case the kids were tired
          from all the fun and games and wanted to rest while they were there
          and work was being done inside.
        </p>
        <p>The innocence of the surroundings placed a smile on my lips.</p>
        <p>
          "I have secured a building not far from here; that is where they would
          rest for the night until the work inside is done. They will come here
          every day if they wish to have fun. The manager here had arranged
          everything, and I just paid whatever expenses she might have needed."
          Elio said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here is like a little camp for them. They don't look tired at all."
          My smile widened but didn't reach my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." Elio shifted closer, putting his arm around my shoulder and
          pulling my body to his.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I honestly didn't think you were this generous," I told him,
          accepting the warmth his body provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shrugged, "Children should not have to spend their childhoods being
          sad. They have their adulthood to cover that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up at him, scrunched my nose as I raised my hand, and poked a
          finger into his hair, pushing his head slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ouch." He said, not a muscle shifting on his face to indicate that my
          action had hurt him.
        </p>
        <p>"You say the most fucked up things sometimes."</p>
        <p>
          "Stating facts is not 'fucked up.'" He answered. "Everybody gets sad
          sometimes; it's harder on some of us adults because when we were kids,
          we did not have a childhood. We did not play outside. Did not laugh
          freely. Did not..." he trailed off, his eyes distant as he watched the
          kids, "Did not know what true happiness felt like." His voice was
          quiet.
        </p>
        <p>A solemn kind of calm washed through me. "Yeah, you're right."</p>
        <p>
          "Now that we are adults, the least we can do for the children around
          us is to make sure they do not grow up knowing what being an adult
          feels like before they actually become adults."
        </p>
        <p>
          The care in his voice almost caught me off guard. I had seen how he
          was with that kid back at the tattoo place, and I did not think for
          one second that though he might have frowned at the kid like he wanted
          the poor boy to melt, he still cared.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you think of them?"</p>
        <p>"What?" <br /></p>
        <p>
          "What do you think of kids, children in general? Would you like to
          have some of your own one day?" He asked, head dropping as he looked
          down at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand went to my throat, playing with the butterfly pendant around
          my neck as I swallowed. "They're precious little beings; what woman
          wouldn't want to have them?"
        </p>
        <p>"I meant you,"</p>
        <p>
          I met his stare. "Are you fishing for something? Thinking of having
          kids with me? Because if that's the case, you need to slow down. I
          don't think we are there yet."
        </p>
        <p>He frowned. "Are you uncomfortable with the question?"</p>
        <p>"Why would I be?"</p>
        <p>"Because you are not answering."</p>
        <p>"Why are you asking?"</p>
        <p>"I am curious."</p>
        <p>"Why are you curious?"</p>
        <p>"Why are you getting defensive?"</p>
        <p>
          I poked the inside of my cheek with my tongue, looking away from him
          as I looked back at the kids, letting the silence stretch before I
          spoke. "Yes, if I could, I would have loved to."
        </p>
        <p>
          When there was silence from his end, I looked up at him, expecting the
          question I saw in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can't have children," I informed him, a tremor in my fingers as
          they stroked the butterfly.
        </p>
        <p>"What...do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to see what he thought through his eyes, I looked away,
          back to the innocence of our surroundings, before I answered. "How do
          you think they made sure none of us got pregnant?" I asked. "No female
          donor child can have children. We can't reproduce because we were not
          made to reproduce."
        </p>
        <p>He stiffened beside me, and my heart almost sank.</p>
        <p>
          "Does that change anything for you?" I let the question slip before I
          could stop it.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a snap, He was turning my body to face his, and with great
          effort, I met his gaze, which was angry and harsh. "Do not speak
          nonsense."
        </p>
        <p>I bit my tongue.</p>
        <p>
          "Do you remember what they did? I do not believe any woman is born
          infertile."
        </p>
        <p>
          I dragged in a breath and let it out. "When then took us to the—when
          we were fourteen and what we had to do upgraded, they took us
          somewhere before we were prepped for penetration. It was a doctor's
          place. I don't think it was registered, but it was an equally big
          organization, too...I didn't know then; they just made us sleep, and
          when we woke up, we were taken back. But as I grew, I learned it was
          Tubal Ligation."
        </p>
        <p>"So, it can be reversed."</p>
        <p>
          "In some cases, yeah. I went to reverse it...but the doctor told me
          there were many damages and the possibility of me ever getting
          pregnant was well—zero to none. And we've had sex unprotected a lot of
          times and nothing—so...yeah."
        </p>
        <p>A look flashed in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          I pursed my lips before speaking, "I've had years to get over that
          fact, Elio; you don't have to pity me."
        </p>
        <p>"I do not pity you. I pity the people who did this to you."</p>
        <p>I laughed, but he did not join me.</p>
        <p>
          Pulling me into him in a hug, he whispered in my ear. "I promise you,
          Zahra, when I find the people who did this to you, the world will
          know."
        </p>
        <p>
          The tone of his voice told me he meant every single word he said. It
          sent a chill down my spine—but my mind loved the idea because it was
          what I also wanted, and with him by my side, I was more assured that
          we would find them, and we would rain hell fucking fire until there
          was nothing but ashes beneath our feet.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "What kind of sick motherfucker makes someone work for a fucking
          surprise." Dog bit out, pinning a glare my way as he sleds into the
          space beside Milk, hitting her shoulder not so gently.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Personal space, Dog? You still smell like paint." Milk pointed out,
          biting on a fry, her hair pulled up in a rough ponytail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog directed his glare at her, "And you smell like toilet, but you
          don't see me pointing it out."
        </p>
        <p>"You just did." She said, offering him a blank look.</p>
        <p>
          "I just did." He responded, gaze lingering before looking away,
          shaking his head, reaching for one of the burgers on the table, and
          taking a big bite out of it until his mouth was too full to chew
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper didn't speak; when he got to the table, he just started feasting
          on the burger like it was the last food on earth, grumbling
          occasionally. Devil was the last to join us after escorting Elio out
          of the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio was flying back to Milan early due to work, and I had convinced
          him to call back Angelo and Casmiro. He had promised to think about
          it, but I highly doubted he would, as he informed me that Casmiro was
          back in his hometown with his family and It would be good for him to
          visit since he almost died recently, and they had been worried. He
          also said Angelo had recently gone into a relationship, and he wanted
          him to cater for it adequately.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't push further after that. I let him be, and he promised to
          call when he landed, leaving me to deal with STREET.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did he leave okay?" I asked as Devil took the space beside me,
          reaching for one of the chilled cokes in the middle of the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, a whole parade and shit—they just came out of nowhere like they
          were waiting for him to exit the building or something—Said he'll call
          when he lands," He flexed his shoulder, taking a swig or the coke, but
          kept drinking and drinking and drinking like he couldn't get enough.
        </p>
        <p>Milk rubbed her neck, tired.</p>
        <p>Upper looked like death.</p>
        <p>
          Dog was angry eating, and Devil kept drinking until the bottle was
          almost empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What kind of drug did you give us?" Upper asked, "I have urges to
          throw up, but I cannot throw up, and I'm so bloody hungry, but I'm so
          full."
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt gripped me. "I'm so sorry, guys. I don't know what I was
          thinking."
        </p>
        <p>Dog—not being able to talk—just gave me the middle finger.</p>
        <p>I deserved that.</p>
        <p>
          "I mean, at least we got the painting? Right? And now we have a map—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And security 24/7 while we're here." Devil supplied. "I am not happy
          you drugged us. But I'm happy we're back in the game."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right after I try not to die from the effect of the drug and
          scrubbing toilets all freaking day." Milk said, the side of her head
          dropping to the table, cheeks pressing flush against the flat surface.
        </p>
        <p>"I helped out?"</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze shifted to me, eyeballs up like she was possessed, thanks to
          the stern glare she shot my way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted closer to Devil, shrinking from her stare—The guy in
          question threw his hand around my shoulder, pulling me further into
          him.
        </p>
        <p>"What's the plan now?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "We study the map and watch our six because I don't think it would
          take people long to figure out we have what they want."
        </p>
        <p>Dog swallowed, drinking his sprite and burping loudly.</p>
        <p>
          Milk's face scrunched up in disgust. "You are so disgusting it hurts
          my eye."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You love me still, pinky brain." He smirked her way, and she
          delivered him the middle finger this time as she raised her head. "The
          map is all colors of messed up; it will take ages to figure it out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You only think like this because you're all drugged up. Wait for the
          fog to clear." I told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "At least we have the penthouse," Dog injected, "Though Zahra claimed
          she rented it from invisible savings we all know shit about."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," Upper tilted his head, studying me. "Why did you serve your
          boyfriend that story, and why did he buy it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He didn't buy it." Devil said, "Either he was the one who rented it,
          and Zahra—with her pride, didn't want Elio to let us know that he
          did—made him lie."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Still sounds like bullshit to me," Dog said, his eyes trying to peel
          out the absolute truth as he watched me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever. We'll have our fun and break and then head back to Milan.
          Elio told me he would arrange a place for us outside the compound, but
          within the district, so that's awesome. But for now—all animosity
          aside, we need to fill our pockets because a lot was spent on that
          cruise, and well, a little thievery here and there wouldn't hurt,
          would it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sounds like fun if we survive this drug, as Milk pointed out," Upper
          said.
        </p>
        <p>"You'll survive it, and I'll make up for it—"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, you will," Dog said. "All fucking errands will be run by you.
          You're our little slave until we leave Mexico."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I accept without complaints," I answered, knowing it would all be
          forgotten when we all woke up more refreshed tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>For now, I ate my food.</p>
        <p>
          Easy and jabbing conversations passed around the table swiftly while
          glares turned into smiles and smiles turned into laughter, and we
          didn't even notice when evening turned into night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was relaxed, contented, in my element, and with my favorite people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked forward to our break because when the time came to work,
          relaxation would be the farthest thing from our minds, and
          fortunately, we were more than prepared. <br /><br /><br />

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><b>THE ROOM </b>smelled like blood and spilled guts.</p>
        <p>
          The odor was repellent, circulating the area that had once been cold
          but was now warm due to the mutilated bodies around me and the body
          heat from four of my soldiers who would, unfortunately, have to clean
          the mess that had ensued from my anger and void mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flexed the muscles around my neck, blowing out a breath of relief as
          one of the soldiers passed me a cigar and a lighter. The moment my
          gaze settled on my hand as it collected the items, I struggled to see
          my skin. All that met my vision was blood; coated around my hand,
          splashed on my forearms, and digging inside my nails.
        </p>
        <p>
          It irritated me, and the urge to soak myself in clean water pulled
          strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          I placed the cigar between my lips, lit up the end, and inhaled the
          smoke until it stroked every nerve ending in my body. I turned back to
          the massacre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five bodies...there were supposed to be six. The Elite people I had
          hired were supposed to be fucking six. One of them had escaped. One
          dead man was still breathing, and a sense of unfinished business
          touched a nerve that made me picture a gruesome punishment for every
          man involved in finding these people—for their carelessness and
          inability to get the job done—Angelo and Casmiro included.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew my actions were a little...erratic. The Elite had no idea who
          had paid them for the job. Still, it was <i>me</i>—they diverted, made
          noise, made things inconvenient for me, and I despised flaws in
          schemes I had taken the time and energy to build up. They brought in
          flaws—<i>greedy thieves with no regard for courtesy. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I had waited a week to do this and wanted to wait a few more
          weeks—make them sweat a little—but today, my mind had been a void of
          its own making, webs of anger and a need for blood, and little relief
          had woven itself around my insides, and the urge to visit this little
          team had plagued me till I succumbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waking up, I wondered why the neutral mood I had carried from the day
          before never followed me to the new day. In fact, I had been on a
          phone call with Zahra and, at some point, slept off naturally—without
          taking any pills to aid it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had been talking about anything and nothing for hours on end. It
          started from the first time they reached a club, and she had retired
          to a private corner to speak with me, distracting me from reading, as
          she talked about the most random things. She refused to disconnect the
          phone—for some reason—thinking I was bored to death and her company
          was the only thing she thought would keep me sane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't mind because I enjoyed hearing her voice and the voices of
          her friends in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even when she returned to their penthouse, and they had dinner, I was
          still connected to the call until she went to her bedroom, and I
          finally settled in bed and slept off with her still talking and on the
          brink of sleep herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          One would think that after all of that and a night of perfect sleep, I
          would wake up feeling light and regular—No—I felt heavy, and when I
          picked up my phone to check the time and then caught the date, I knew
          why I felt like I had the world on my shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was December 1st, my birthday, and I hadn't mentally been prepared
          for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After my 19th birthday, I always took care by schooling my mind a day
          before my birthdays, but things had been going smoothly for the past
          few weeks; I was happy, I was contented, and things were normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          But somehow, today became so grey. I had tried to think of reasons to
          be happy and grateful, but thinking about them made them grey, too,
          and the feeling ignited anger. Uncontrollable anger that seemed to
          sink into my skin and body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had taken the longest shower, went back to the bedroom to arrange my
          bed, and did not like the little crease by the side, so I redid the
          whole thing; there was a little crease in the middle, and I redid
          again—up to five times before I was satisfied—the work made me
          angrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going to find clothes to wear, I despised how every material in my
          wardrobe seemed dirty; even if I knew they were clean, they somehow
          managed to look dirty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I succumbed, selected a standard button-up, and ironed it even though
          it was already well-ironed. I performed that action—over and over and
          over and over again, burning myself on occasions and swinging the
          machine to a nearby wall out of anger—went back to pick it up,
          inspected it for damage, and returned to ironing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had woken up at around eight in the morning and was leaving for the
          torture rooms at noon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could not eat anything. I did not crave food. I craved alcohol,
          anything that would make me feel numb.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to finish with the Elite group on time, but after I saw
          them, it took two hours to kill five people completely. Torture and
          maiming—blood, opened flesh, screams, cries, terror, and gore—somehow,
          I wasn't satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blowing out the smoke, I tilted my head, studying the one with
          strawberry blonde hair, now soaked in blood, his fingers still
          twitching.
        </p>
        <p>"Gun."</p>
        <p>
          It was in my grip in an instant, and I angled the barrel to the dying
          man's head and rapidly pulled the trigger until his brain particles
          started to slip out of his scattered head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angling the gun back up, I studied my work for almost a minute before
          nodding. "Hm." I stretched my hand that held the gun to the soldier
          who had given it to me. But for some reason, the weapon remained in my
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, I turned to look at the soldier; his face was pale, eyes on
          the man I had just shot.
        </p>
        <p>"Was he a friend?"</p>
        <p>
          The soldier snapped upright, blinking back as he looked at my
          forehead, unable to meet my eyes, body shaken up. From his young face,
          I could tell he was in his early twenties.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head fiercely, fear in his eyes. "No sir, no sir, I—I am
          sorry, sir,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, irritation biting at my skin. "What on God's name am I
          looking at?"
        </p>
        <p>Dread tainted his eyes at the disdain and irritation in my voice.</p>
        <p>"Sir, I'm—"</p>
        <p>
          I raised the gun to his head, pulled the trigger, and watched his
          lifeless body drop before I looked at the other soldiers, faces stoic,
          eyes ahead, awaiting orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stretched my gun towards one, and he quickly collected it. Body
          firm, trained.
        </p>
        <p>That was what I liked to see.</p>
        <p>
          "Inform the recruitment manager that I would like to meet with him. I
          will not tolerate little mistakes like this."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, Marino."</p>
        <p>
          "Pass a message across to the data team. Tell them that if they do not
          dig out the whereabouts of the last member in the elite group before
          the day ends, I will do personal research on them and everyone they
          care about, and then I will pay them a farewell visit."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
        <p>
          I stepped out without another word, two soldiers following
          automatically behind me as I walked from the torture room to my house.
          Everyone who passed by avoided my eyes and went out of my way; some
          had fear in their eyes, and some were stoic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I itched to pick out the ones who cowered—in fact—I would add it to my
          agenda to do a personal inspection of every man in the empire. It
          would take more than a day and even more than a week—but the urge to
          pluck out blunt thorns was very strong—or maybe the anger simmering
          underneath my skin compelled these thoughts because usually, I would
          not care.
        </p>
        <p>When I entered my house, the soldiers didn't follow.</p>
        <p>
          I headed straight to my bedroom, discarded the cigar, and started
          taking off the dirty clothes on my body—Entering the room half naked,
          I walked into the bathroom and straight to the sink, turned on the
          water, and placed my hand underneath it. The water that came out clean
          and clear from the faucet was tainted with blood when it met my hands.
          I cleaned and cleaned, wiping off dried blood with soap as the
          bloodied water went down the drain.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was satisfied after what seemed like the longest time, I turned
          off the faucet and went to the bathtub, turning on the cold water as
          it filled up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took off the remainder of my clothes—as I got into the tub and the
          water rose around my body, my muscles were still wound tight even at
          the coldness on my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let my head fall back to the tub's edge, closed my eyes, and
          swallowed with effort as I tried to calm my breathing.
        </p>
        <p>It wasn't working.</p>
        <p>
          As the water filled and stopped filling up, I let my body sink into
          it. My chest, shoulders, neck, and then my head until I was completely
          under. A calm claimed me, and I stayed that way for a while, holding
          my breath with my eyes closed—when I was at my limit, I opened my eyes
          underwater, and the silhouette of my mother leaning by the tub was
          what I saw next.
        </p>
        <p><i>She was still in that black dress. </i></p>
        <p>
          I was about to come up, but her hands came into the water, holding my
          shoulders down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's okay," Her muffled voice said with a smile as she held me down,
          grip strong, while I fought to come up for air. "It's all right, Elio;
          you will be with me soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I struggled, my whole body felt like it was under
          paralysis. I couldn't move, and she held me tightly, firmly. But
          somehow, I was still struggling—in my mind, I was still fighting to
          move, get up, and take oxygen, but my body wouldn't respond, and my
          mother wouldn't let go of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't hold my breath any longer and was forced to part my lips
          underneath the water, both my nostrils and my mouth filling my lungs
          with liquid—and I was drowning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, she let me go, and the paralysis slipped from my body as I
          emerged with a force that had water pouring out of the tub to the
          ground; my hands—shaking—gripped the edge of the tub firmly as I
          coughed out the water, taking back air into my lungs in a wheeze like
          manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          My chest and eyes burned, my body shook—and no one was there...I was
          alone...I had been alone.
        </p>
        <p>My mother was not here.</p>
        <p><i>My mother is dead. </i></p>
        <p>
          When I'd managed to cough air back into my lungs, I lifted myself from
          the tub and grabbed a towel by the side, wrapping it around myself
          firmly as I carelessly stepped out of the tub, forgetting water had
          touched the tiled ground from when I got out earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          One second, my leg was on the ground, and the next, it was slipping,
          and my body was plummeting right underneath my feet, and I met the
          ground with a forceful, sharp thud that sounded like a slap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something shattered, and a sharp pain sliced into my elbow. There was
          also a tingling burn inside my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a few minutes, I remained in that position on the ground. My body
          hurt. My head, light—and my mind, still a void.
        </p>
        <p><i>December 1st. </i></p>
        <p>
          I hated every single fucking bit of this day. Bad luck always
          followed. Everything always goes wrong. Even if I had prepared myself
          the day before, something would ruin it. Something that would hurt me,
          either mentally or physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Till today, I still could not pinpoint what or who exactly had jinxed
          me the day I turned nineteen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it because I had woken up on the wrong side of the bed that day?
          Would things have turned out differently if I had woken up on my right
          side? Or was it from my one-night stand with the blonde, Rosa, whom I
          scared into sending me out of her house? Was it because I did not eat
          with Elia on that day? Or was it my sister's words, which still echoed
          in my ear if I stopped and listened for her voice amongst the chaos in
          my head? The last three words she had said to me.
        </p>
        <p><i>"I hate you!" </i></p>
        <p>
          A sigh left my lips as I started to move, trying to inspect the damage
          on my arm.
        </p>
        <p>I had broken some glass objects during my fall, which injured me.</p>
        <p>
          Looking in the direction where the pain came from, the bite
          intensified when I saw the gash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skin above my elbow had been slashed—too deep and enough to need
          stitches. The ground was messy, stained with blood and water.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck."</p>
        <p>
          I managed to stand, tremors still in my hands, as I headed to the
          mirror to check the damage inside my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bared my teeth; they were all blooded. I injured my upper gum, but
          it didn't hurt as much as my elbow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spat the blood into the sink and rinsed my mouth and teeth until
          cleaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I started inspecting my elbow wound, managing to get first aid as
          I washed off the blood that had slipped down my hand before cleaning
          the damage and treating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fishing for a bandage and trying to work that open with one hand and
          my teeth, I managed to free it, but it rolled right onto the ground,
          the dried cloth getting wet with the water and blood on the
          floor—another mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes for about ten seconds, trying to tamp down on the
          sudden urge to break something out of annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that same moment, I heard the door to my bedroom open and close.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio?" Zahra's voice met my ears, and I froze. "You in the bathroom?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her footstep drew closer until the bathroom door opened, and her eyes
          found me—the smile on her face dying instantly when she caught the
          blood and the mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck happened?" she rushed towards me, inspecting my hand as
          concern filled her eyes, "Are you okay?" she reached to touch me, "Let
          me see—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't," I spoke, tugging my hand from her reach. "I will take care of
          it."
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked up at me and then the wound, "It's okay, I can help cover
          it—"
        </p>
        <p>"I will do it myself, thank you."</p>
        <p>She reached for me again, but I tugged away.</p>
        <p>
          Her brows curved in a frown, brown eyes showing care and equal
          annoyance. "Let me help you."
        </p>
        <p>"I am very capable of tending to myself."</p>
        <p>
          "But it looks terrible; how did it happen?" Her eyes looked around the
          bathroom. I took that time to scan her from head to toe; her hair was
          left loose and brushed to perfection, and she wore a casual
          long-sleeved ruffle wrap dress that stopped way above her thigh and
          showcased too much cleavage. She smelled good, too, fresh out of a
          probably less traumatic bath than the one I had just experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >What is she doing here? Yesterday, if I recall correctly, she was
            in Mexico.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gaze fell back to me, searching as she reached forward again,
          "What's wrong? Why won't you let me help?"
        </p>
        <p>"Because there is no need for that."</p>
        <p>
          "You don't have to be stubborn about it. You clearly can't do it
          yourself; your hands are shaking—"
        </p>
        <p>"I can do it myself."</p>
        <p>"E—"</p>
        <p>
          "Can you give me space?" I snapped, irritated. "I will tend to myself
          and then join you in a moment; can you do that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked, sensing I wasn't in the mood for an argument, before
          hesitating a while, sighing and thankfully backing off. "Okay, I'll
          wait for you outside the—"
        </p>
        <p>"The bedroom, outside the bedroom."</p>
        <p>
          She was taken aback, her lips thinning downward, and then she nodded.
          "Okay."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, she left the bathroom, locking the door behind her. I
          waited until the bedroom door opened and closed, and then I let out a
          breath of relief, not realizing how much I hated her seeing me like
          this.
        </p>
        <p>Shame was the most prominent emotion.</p>
        <p>
          It took a while, but I managed to finish up with the wound and clean
          the mess in the bathroom. When I reached my wardrobe, all the black
          button-ups seemed...<i>bloodied</i>, like the one I had taken off
          earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unable to stand it, I went to another axis in the wardrobe and found a
          white one. I felt satisfied as I put that on quickly and made myself
          look presentable before leaving the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found her in the kitchen, leaning on the table with her hands
          tapping furiously on her phone screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her legs were on full display, tanned, brown, and so fucking
          beautiful. The dress seemed to be made especially for her, and the
          urge to hug her from behind was there, but I knew she would probably
          smell the oddness of my mood and not my cologne.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't notice me until I was in line with her vision, and she did
          a double take while my eyes zeroed in on the cake right by her side on
          the kitchen counter.
        </p>
        <p>My stomach—something was wrong with my stomach.</p>
        <p>
          "I love the shirt," she said with a genuine, surprised smile, putting
          her phone away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," I said, ignoring the cake and the feeling it evoked,
          before moving to the whiskey collections on the shelf, turning away
          from her as I got a glass and a bottle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />When I turned, she was rounding the counter and putting her arms
          around me in a hug that warmed me and relaxed the muscles the water in
          the tub and my connection with the ground had made tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Happy birthday." She said, the smile and brightness in her voice that
          made me feel even heavier than before.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          She pulled away to look up at me as I dropped the items in my hand on
          the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You didn't hear me wish you on the phone when it was midnight today?
          I wanted to be the first to wish you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Very thoughtful," I responded, pouring myself a drink as silence
          reigned until she sighed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's going on, Elio?" she asked, and I glanced at her, noting a bit
          of confusion, anticipation, and a little excitement as she spoke. "Are
          you mad because I didn't text you? If you are, there's a reason for
          that. Aside from being on the flight and having it delayed by an hour,
          we arrived back at the condo you had for us, and Milk and I had to get
          things from the store while we tried to bake a cake with Dog, and then
          we had to leave the cake even after it had baked for a few hours so
          that it could get cold and great, and then we designed it—I mixed the
          whole thing and it took great efforts and you need to try it, I—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It looks wonderful," I cut in, carrying the whiskey glass, taking a
          sip as I eyed the cake and then her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was looking right at me, eyebrows brushed, eyes brighter due to
          the light color she had applied, her lips were glossed, and she looked
          terrific—took her time to look amazing for this—but my mouth spoke
          before my head, "I see the efforts you made with the cake, and I
          appreciate it, but I am not very keen to eat it. Not because I do not
          think it will be good, but because I am not in the mood."
        </p>
        <p>
          The anticipation and excitement in her eyes vanished like I had
          squashed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's wrong with you?" apprehension laced her tone. "Did something
          happen?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No." The sip I had taken from the whiskey glass was enough to realize
          that I didn't need a drink, so I dropped it.
        </p>
        <p>"<i>Clearly</i>, something is wrong."</p>
        <p>"What gave you that notion."</p>
        <p>
          She waved her hand as if trying to gather my aura. "This, all of this.
          You're too...straight."
        </p>
        <p>I tilted my head, confused. "I am straight."</p>
        <p>
          "That's not what I mean. You're too bland and odd, and— you're acting
          like you don't want me here."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe I don't."</p>
        <p>
          <i>Fuck</i>. That was supposed to stay in my head—those three words
          were supposed to remain in my head, not fall from my mouth because I
          do want her here, I do, but I just don't want her to see me
          like...this, and with the way her eyes widened, looking like I had
          slapped her with my words, had me completely frozen on the spot.
        </p>
        <p>I had hurt her feelings.</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, looking away from me as she walked back around the
          counter and grabbed her bag from a kitchen stool. "You can throw away
          the cake if you don't want it or whatever you do to things you don't
          want." With that, she made her way out of the kitchen, her footsteps
          getting fainter and fainter.
        </p>
        <p>
          My common sense was working very slowly today, and it took me seconds
          too long to make my body move and chase right after her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was almost at the door out of the house when I caught onto her
          wrist, and she spun around, her bag swinging and getting me right in
          the nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          It stung, and I held it immediately, the pain sending warmth to my
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sharp gasp left her, and she dropped the bag to the floor instantly,
          eyes wide, "What the fuck! Oh my God, I didn't hear your footsteps—Are
          you bleeding?"
        </p>
        <p>"One—one moment."</p>
        <p>
          She tried to see it, hands on my face. "Fuck, I'm sorry. It was
          instincts, and I didn't hear you behind me and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck do you have in that bag? Fuck." I wasn't bleeding, but
          it hurt more than the elbow wound.
        </p>
        <p>"It was made with a bit of metal—God, I'm sorry."</p>
        <p>
          "No, no, it's good." I managed out, knowing the skin around the area
          was already growing red. "It happens. I would have gotten hurt one way
          or another; it's fairly normal."
        </p>
        <p>"What the hell does that even mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "Nothing you need to worry about," I removed my hand from my nose,
          blinking my vision clear. "Lo siento," <i>I'm sorry. </i>I apologized.
          "For earlier, I did not mean for you to leave...I am just—I am having
          a very bad day, and I did not want you to see me like that."
        </p>
        <p>Her gaze softened. "You were okay yesterday..."</p>
        <p>"Yes, I was. But I don't know. It happens like this...sometimes."</p>
        <p>She nodded, "You want to go somewhere to talk about it?"</p>
        <p>I eyed her. "Where?"</p>
        <p>
          "I may or may not have reserved a spot for us at a restaurant. For
          your birthday, should in case you wanted to leave the house?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain in my nose subsided a little. "Oh, you had a day planned for
          us?"
        </p>
        <p>She nodded.</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "It's your birthday..." she answered. "Birthdays are special, and from
          the looks of it, you don't really celebrate."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I never have," I confessed. "That cake on the counter is the first I
          have ever received. In my entire life. So, if I acted weird about it,
          you know why."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Well," she said quietly. "Now you
          have me to show you why having a birthday cake is normal. Most
          especially one made with so much..." Something swirled in her eyes,
          and she raised herself, pressing her lips to mine in a light kiss,
          before pulling away, pretty eyes looking between mine as she completed
          her sentence, "So much...care."
        </p>
        <p>Somehow, I could materialize a smile from the chaos in my head.</p>
        <p>
          "I rented a car. A better one this time, and you're driving us to the
          restaurant; we'll eat and talk and fill your stomach and get you back
          in a good mood; what do you say?"
        </p>
        <p>"All right, okay, yes."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          About an hour later, the woman I considered my partner had taken me as
          the center of her entertainment. I had already come to the fact that
          she had terrible table manners, and it didn't bother me anymore. The
          glare I sent her didn't have any weight as she tried to stifle her
          laughter, her eyes going red with the efforts she was making to
          withhold it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I really don't know why I like you," I stated, shaking my head as she
          raised a hand as if she was stopping the laughter, but when she tried
          to speak, laughter was all that came out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry," she wheezed, face red, "I'm sorry, I'm just—I'm just
          trying to picture it. You," laugh, "Falling from," more laugher, "The
          bathtub," a wheeze. "It's so—it's so not—I can't picture it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "People fall, Zahra. People fall all the time. And mine was pretty
          fatal; you should not be laughing. I could have died."
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />She sucked in a shaky breath. "I'm glad you didn't, but—do you
          happen to have a—a camera in the bathroom? I just—I gotta see that
          shit for myself."
        </p>
        <p>"You are a very terrible person." I pointed out.</p>
        <p>
          She busted out laughing again, gaining attention from people around
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          She blew out a breath in an attempt to calm herself. "What? People
          falling is—there's just something about it that—I don't
          know—especially you? Mr. Never-not-careless-always-careful-and
          proper."
        </p>
        <p>
          I leveled her with a stare. "I must admit that I can never be too
          careful. I am only human, after all."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, now you're trying to seem more human to placate yourself."</p>
        <p>
          "And you are becoming less human by bullying me with your laughter. On
          what is supposed to be my birthday."
        </p>
        <p>
          She rolled her eyes. "Swear that if it weren't me who had that
          bathroom accident, you wouldn't be laughing at my expense."
        </p>
        <p>"I wouldn't. Because, unlike you, I would hate to see you hurt."</p>
        <p>
          She raised a brow. "You wouldn't try to picture it, not even one
          fucking bit, lie that you wouldn't."
        </p>
        <p>"I wouldn't."</p>
        <p>"See? That's a lie."</p>
        <p>I shook my head, "Why do I even try to indulge you?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because I'm the most sensible person you know?" she batted her
          eyelashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You would really hate to hear my thoughts right now," I told her,
          evoking a small laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know...this is like our first real date like we came out for the
          actual purpose of going on a date."
        </p>
        <p>"I thought it was for my birthday?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, it is, but this place is fancy, and I reserved it two days ago.
          So it's a birthday first date. I've never had one of those."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, "I think that statement should be rephrased. You've never
          had one of me."
        </p>
        <p>"Look who's getting cocky now." she chuckled.</p>
        <p>I shrugged.</p>
        <p>
          "So what do you do on your birthdays? I know you don't celebrate, but
          what do you do?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />"Get hurt, unintentionally. Almost every birthday of mine. It's
          like one of those curses in paranormal books."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Paranormal books? What's paranormal?" she asked curiosity in her
          eyes. She truly did not know what paranormal meant.
        </p>
        <p>"Someone supernatural."</p>
        <p>Her brows shot up, "Oh...like horror things, scary things?"</p>
        <p>"Along that line, yes."</p>
        <p>
          "Well, I think you're just jinxing yourself. Sometimes our minds
          unknowingly manifest these thoughts, and our lives take hold of them,
          and we jinx ourselves without knowing."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, seeing sense in what she was saying, although the feeling
          did not touch the surface of what I actually felt. I did not comment
          on that because the last thing I wanted was to trouble her with what I
          felt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our conversation veered in another direction. I tried to keep my mind
          on track with her—often getting lost in my body and coming right back
          whenever she laughed or covered the side of her mouth from others'
          view when she wanted to eat messily because she couldn't help herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, she excused herself to the restroom when our starter was
          cleared and the main meal came through. I checked my phone, seeing a
          happy birthday text from Angelo and a picture of a package his mother
          had organized for me. There was a birthday wish from Gemma, with tons
          of red hearts and a promise to shower me with presents when we see
          each other again; there was also a small video clip from Gran Louisa.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a short happy birthday message and a reminder to bring Zahra
          over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still getting lost in the message, I stopped when I felt Zahra's
          presence. I turned my phone screen off, looking up to see she was just
          two feet away from me when a woman trying to leave a table bumped into
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm so sorry I didn't see you there." Zahra apologized politely, but
          the woman, who looked like she had been angry before bumping into her,
          shot her a glare, muttering something in a language I didn't
          understand, but with the way Zahra's politeness quickly shifted to a
          frown, I knew it was something foul.
        </p>
        <p>Zahra responded in the language, a slight frown on her face.</p>
        <p>
          The woman didn't back down; she quickly sized her up and probably
          thought she could take her if worse came to worse. I picked up my
          fork, cut through the meat, watched the scene unfold, and eyed the man
          sitting on the table the woman had been bolting from; he was also
          watching the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman responded to Zahra, firming her stance, the language falling
          out of her mouth in a show that she wasn't saying anything pleasant.
          Her pitch was increasing by the second, causing a scene. Everyone was
          paying attention to everything happening, even if I was sure nobody
          understood the back and forth unless those who understood the
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw the exact moment Zahra's calm snapped; it was almost the same
          time the man stood behind the woman, whispering something in her ear
          and cautiously looking around as if embarrassed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Zahra spoke, the venom in her voice could not be mistaken as
          anything other than anger, and with the way the woman's eyes widened,
          I knew my little witch had struck a nerve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staff began to gather at the corners, needing clarification about what
          was happening.
        </p>
        <p>The woman stepped forward. "What the fuck did you say?"</p>
        <p>"You heard—"</p>
        <p>
          Zahra was cut off when the woman pushed her, and almost like she had
          gotten the opening she had been waiting for, she moved to retaliate,
          but the worm by the woman's back encircled his dirty hand around
          Zahra's arm as if to hold her back from attacking his companion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away, the grip I had on the fork tightened, and I picked up
          the knife, forcefully slicing through the food on my plate as I spoke,
          "If you want to keep your hand, you will take it off my woman,"
        </p>
        <p>
          My voice was surprisingly calm, audible enough to shift all attention
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The restaurant became silent, and my soldiers, who had been discreetly
          standing around the corners, all took a step forward, enunciating the
          silence as I dug the fork into the slice of meat I had cut and then
          carefully carried it into my mouth as I raised my gaze, chewing
          slowly, my eyes solely on the man.
        </p>
        <p>"Would you like to keep your hand?"</p>
        <p>
          The man swallowed, letting his hand drop as he tugged at the woman who
          now seemed afraid, same as everyone around who—telling from their
          features—were a bit uncomfortable with whatever aura I appeared to
          possess at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          One last glance at Zahra, the woman was about to oblige, taking a step
          back, but I shook my head, and her movement halted as my gaze settled
          on the man.
        </p>
        <p>"You do not leave until you apologize,"</p>
        <p>Apprehension stained the woman's eyes as she looked at the man.</p>
        <p>A sigh came from Zahra, "It's all right, E—"</p>
        <p>
          "You do not leave until you apologize or you lose your hand. My
          patience is running very thin." My voice covered Zahra's, and I heard
          some flinches from tables nearby, but I was unbothered as I watched,
          dug another cut in the meat, and ate it without looking away from the
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gulped down and turned to Zahra, "I'm sorry for—holding your arm.
          It was wrong of me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, looking away. "Some people do not understand basic manners,"
          I muttered, raising a dismissive hand, and I could feel my soldiers
          retreating to their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A volume increased the classic music in the distance, and the couple
          walked out hastily from the restaurant. Zahra resumed her position
          opposite me, the usual murmurs resuming.
        </p>
        <p>"That was quite unnecessary; I was handling it fine,"</p>
        <p>
          I cut through the meat, not looking at her. "I know you were. My
          problem was not with the odd woman. It was with the worm behind her."
        </p>
        <p>"Still it—"</p>
        <p>"What language was that?"</p>
        <p>"Polish." She answered, "You didn't have to—"</p>
        <p>
          "You should drop the subject," I put the piece I had cut in my mouth
          and, without looking at her, proceeded to cut another when I
          swallowed. "Or I will be very compelled to cut off more than his
          hand."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not—"</p>
        <p>"Do not remind me of the people I let live."</p>
        <p>Silence passed between us, and she sighed, dropping the topic.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, we had recovered from the weird air around us, and I was
          driving us back to the compound after she had pushed us to a cinema to
          see a movie about people who were robots; I had wondered briefly why
          she didn't want us to go back just yet. I was not really tired, but I
          was burnt out from being around people and things I did not want to
          see.
        </p>
        <p>
          I honestly would have preferred a little quiet evening with her.
          Still, I indulged because she seemed to love going places with me,
          mainly because I was a novice to most normal things people do, and
          according to her, she gets a certain kind of high from being the one
          to introduce me to new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, she was on her phone, looking quite relaxed, though her
          eyes were concentrated as she texted whoever she was texting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took one of my hands from the wheel, placing it on her thigh.
          "Everything all right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her head snapped up to mine, wide eyes telling me everything was not
          all right. "Yeah!" she said almost too cheerfully. "I mean, no...not
          really...could you um—drive a little faster? I really need to pee."
        </p>
        <p>I eyed her. "Indeed?"</p>
        <p>"Yup...we finished a whole bottle of wine, so...yeah,"</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, kept my hand on her thigh as I stepped on the gas, eyes back
          on the road as the car sped off under a small bridge, and I didn't
          take care as I surpassed other cars, pressing my foot deeper on the
          accelerator as the car sped.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uh Elio..." Zahra's voice was shaky as she inched back in her seat.
          "When I said fast, I didn't mean—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The car went a bit off course, and a sharp squeal left her mouth as I
          took my hand from her thigh and tried to steady the vehicle again;
          with us emerging from the bridge, passing cars veering away from us
          like we were a closed paradox for a fatal accident.
        </p>
        <p>"I think I'm gonna puke." She squeaked out.</p>
        <p>"Remember, the car is rented."</p>
        <p>"You're a terrible driver, and your license should be revoked."</p>
        <p>"You should ask if I even have a license."</p>
        <p>"Oh God."</p>
        <p>
          In almost 40 minutes, we arrived back at the compound, and I flexed my
          shoulders, mentally prepping myself to ask her if she would be down to
          give me a shoulder massage because I still felt body pains due to the
          fall earlier today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stepping into the house with her, I didn't consider the darkness
          around the space too concerning. It was the different smells of
          perfumes, drinks, and food—the lights suddenly came on, and different
          voices yelled a: "SURPRISE!" before music blasted from speakers, and
          my eyes took in the people in my home.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of STREET, Casmiro, a few of my associates that lived not too far
          from the compound, strangers that I was supposed to know—and the
          lights—God, the lights were too bright, and I didn't even register
          half of what was going on—people were walking up to me wishing me a
          happy birthday, voices were everywhere, strange, disturbing music—I
          think I was sweating, and my pulse was—
        </p>
        <p>
          "Happy birthday, Boss," Casmiro said with a shoulder pat. "I feel bad
          that I always thought it was December third, and I always wished you
          on that day, and you never once corrected me—but I don't blame you; I
          should have known,"
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice was light and a little slow, and something told me the
          alcohol in his grip wasn't the first one he had had for the night. He
          raised a glass to Zahra, then walked away, allowing more people to
          wish me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything happened in a blur, and I was forced to talk to different
          people all night long...drinks were passing around, people were
          invading spaces they should not invade.
        </p>
        <p>
          I received so many gifts from everyone around and soldiers who dropped
          by for only a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Words from here and there told me STREET had planned the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra had been away from me most of the time, and Elia was the one who
          kept me company even if I supplied one-word answers because my being
          was too tense to deliver more than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia had told me he had just realized why I stayed extra hours with
          him on this particular day, and he told me I should have told him...to
          be honest, I could not comprehend the answer I gave him then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was having an out-of-body experience—emotions flickering between
          angry, sad, happy, bad, and angry and sad and happy and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was forced to eat the cake, even if it tasted good, and I think I
          told them so; I still wasn't feeling my mind speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took almost three hours into the night before I decided I wanted to
          head to bed. People were already leaving, and just a few close people
          remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra followed me. We showered together; I kissed, lifted, and pressed
          her back against the shower wall. I was inside her, lost in her; my
          mind was my own again; she was real, and this was real, and everything
          that happened today was real.
        </p>
        <p><i>Real, Elio, real. </i></p>
        <p>Real shouldn't feel like a time-lapse.</p>
        <p>
          I was on the bed again, and she was in my shirt as she held a small
          box in her hand, a shy smile on her lips as she joined me under the
          covers, tucking her hair behind her ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your present," she said, and I lifted myself to my good elbow,
          collecting the box from her and hoping the smile I gave reached my
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"The whole party wasn't your present?"</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled, "That was mostly STREET's idea, and getting Casmiro and
          Angelo to authorize it was a pain. But they did because I kinda bribed
          them that it might put them in your good graces again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm," I said, opening the box to see a silver necklace. Almost the
          same pattern as hers, but the silver was darker, and the chain wasn't
          as thin as the one I gave her; it was a little thicker. The pendant,
          though—was what made me stop.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you like it? It took about two weeks, but it was worth it."</p>
        <p>
          It was the same shape as the tattoo on her shoulder, the love and E
          shape, with the little M by the side.
        </p>
        <p>I looked up at her, "This must have—this must have cost a lot."</p>
        <p>
          "No, not really...I had some friends make it, and I was discounted.
          The friends who made my anklet?"
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, "It's beautiful, Zahra, thank you."</p>
        <p>
          She smiled, taking the jewelry and pulling it out. The chain around it
          was long enough for the pendant to reach the point where my chest
          ended. She hooked it around my neck and snuggled closer, quietly
          asking.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you happy?"</p>
        <p>
          I pulled her close to me, "Hm, Yes, I am. Thank you for everything."
        </p>
        <p>"Shut up, don't thank me, it's kind of my girlfriendly duties."</p>
        <p>
          After that, we whispered between each other, her going off about how
          future birthdays would go, and then we slowly went off course, having
          an out-of-context discussion about how age flies and how far we will
          be in the period of years. I honestly didn't know how the conversation
          went off to discussing a possible future together or how we looked at
          possible reasons for why we would separate if we were ever to
          separate.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was primarily meaningless bickering that took us hours into the
          night until she fell asleep, and my eyes remained wide open.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hated it. I was so tired and worn out that I just needed to sleep it
          all off—that void, the out-of-body feeling still plagued me, and even
          as I detached myself from Zahra, walked into the bathroom, and fished
          for my sleeping pills, it felt like someone else was controlling my
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I popped two pills in my mouth, even though it was prescribed to take
          only one. But one was never enough to knock me out in a few minutes;
          It would have taken time before it started working; two did the trick.
          I swallowed them dry, closed the pill case, and locked the mirrored
          cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I returned to the bathroom door and stopped right before I could open
          it.
        </p>
        <p>There was a silence.</p>
        <p>
          There was a deafening silence inside my head, telling me my thoughts
          had indeed vacated. In fact, I tried and stopped to listen to myself,
          but nothing was forthcoming.
        </p>
        <p>I was functioning solely on action and not thought.</p>
        <p>
          Even as I stepped back from the door, once, twice, like my being was
          in reverse, going back to where I once stood over the mirror cabinet,
          watching my reflection and seeing a stranger staring right back at
          me...I tried—I really tried to remember who that person was, or what I
          was, or what my name was, or how I came to be here, what I had done
          seconds before I came back here to stare at a reflection that didn't
          reflect anything back to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robotically, I raised my hand, opened the cabinet, picked up the pill
          case, and opened the lid before tipping my head back and throwing
          every pill into my mouth.

          <b>NOT OFTEN </b>did I let anger rule my mind nor my actions, but that
          was precisely what thundered through me when I stormed into the room
          and caught the man who had been dead to the world—just
          yesterday—inserting cufflinks on the wrist collar of his black shirt,
          not once looking up when I entered the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>This</i> was when I felt the second tug of tears, one I had held
          back for almost a week since I found him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hair was brushed back, cut, and tamed. His shirt was well tucked
          into his perfectly fitting black slacks, and his black shoes were
          spotless. He looked clean—like he was heading out, getting ready to
          start his day like nothing happened. Like this was just a typical day
          when he woke up and dressed to go to some important meeting...like he
          wasn't—like this wasn't—
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers shook as I quickly locked the door behind me, took out the
          key, and slipped it into my jacket.
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised his head briefly, gaze trained on the door, before focusing
          back on the cufflinks, not once looking at me. "Whatever you are
          trying to start, I suggest you abort now. I am in no mood to indulge
          it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed loudly, disbelief making the anger beneath my skin bubble,
          and I stomped my way to him, stopping when I was right before his tall
          and broad frame. "Fuck you, and f-fuck your mood."
        </p>
        <p>
          My voice shook. My body shook. The breath I dragged into my lungs
          shook. My vision blurred as I watched him, angry at his nonchalance
          and stupidity for abruptly leaving the hospital building in the
          compound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anger I felt gave way to sadness. I was sad that he couldn't look
          at me—that he wouldn't look at me, but at the same time, I was
          glad...glad that he was okay, relieved that he was standing and that
          he was here...still here...still alive...more alive than he had been a
          week ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          My throat tightened, gathering a lump as I blinked a tear down my
          cheek.
        </p>
        <p>
          One week...it had been one week since I found him in that bathroom.
          Motionless. His chest wasn't heaving, his nose wasn't producing any
          breath, his fingers were still warm but were growing cold, he looked
          pale, he looked <i>dead</i>—it had been a week, but my throat was
          still sore from how fucking loud I had screamed, how I had stumbled to
          my knees beside him, seeing the empty pill case right next to his
          body.
        </p>
        <p>Seeing him now, the whole thing replayed in my head, bit by bit.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >With shaking hands, I felt for his pulse, and there was nothing;
            his neck was slowly slipping from warm to cold, telling me he hadn't
            been unconscious for long. I held both sides of his face, shifting
            closer to his body. "Hey," I called softly, tapping his cheek like
            that would bring him back to consciousness. "Elio—" It was that
            moment my gaze had landed on the pill case beside him, and gears
            began to turn and reconstruct in my head.

        <p>
          <i
            >Fear was the next thing to hold my reasoning captive, and an urgent
            need to get him to breathe rumbled inside me as I placed my hands on
            his chest, pumping hard.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Come on, Elio...come on," I pumped and pumped, leaning to pinch
            his nose, covering my mouth with his and blowing steadily.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p><i>Nothing happened. </i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Fuck, fuck, fuck," I panicked, starting compressions again,
            pumping and pumping, and sweating and fighting off the fear clouding
            my senses.</i

        </p>
        <p>
          <i

            blow air back into his lungs before rising to see nothing happening
            again.

        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I started pumping again, harder this time, my own heart hammering
            so fast against my chest.

        <p>
          <i>"Please, God, no. Please God, no, please, please, please," </i>

          <i
            >I was crazed, breathing sharply as I applied enough strength
            against his chest.</i

          <i
            >"Come back to me," pump, "come back to me," pump. "Come on, Elio."

        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I pinched his nose, tilted his head a little as I blew breath into
            him, and rose to check.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>Nothing happened. </i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >A sharp sob left me as I started compressions immediately. The
            situation suddenly becoming more real. Frantic, I screamed for help
            but knew no one could hear me, not from here. His room was literally
            the last one downstairs. I knew Casmiro was in the building, Devil
            was too, probably most of STREET too, but I wasn't sure—I wasn't
            sure of anything at the moment; all I knew was that I needed this
            man to breathe—tears clouded my vision—I just needed him to live.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I continued the compressions. I won't give up until I feel
            something. I won't give up.

        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Elio, please, please, Dad, come on, come on, breathe for me," </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Leaning to pinch his nose and blow into his mouth, I checked to see
            if his chest moved.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>Nothing. </i></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >My lips trembled as my stomach tightened, and I let my tears fall,
            starting compressions again, but it was weak because my bones
            suddenly felt like jelly, and I wanted to curl up beside his body
            and keep him from growing cold like he was doing beneath my palm.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Please...please...God, please, this cannot happen to me.
            Elio...wake up, come on...come on, come on baby, breathe, breathe,
            come back. I'm still here; come back." I pumped harder. "Wake up,
            please...I can't lose you. if you can hear me, please—fuck." I
            raised my forearms and wiped my tears and sweat as I repeatedly
            pumped his chest with more strength until I wasn't sure if I was
            hitting his chest or giving him compressions. I just needed his
            heart to wake up.

        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I was shaking everywhere as I hit him. I hit his chest repeatedly;
            the sound of my fist slapping hard against his skin, where his heart
            was, almost made me sick.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I pinched his nose, tilted his head back, and pressed my mouth down
            to his as I blew air again, rising to see his chest moving slightly.

        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I almost doubled over, a strange kind of strength overcoming me the
            next instant as I took my compressions back to the average rate,
            continuing the CPR for a few seconds before I got on my feet and
            rushed back to the room with blinding speed, finding my phone while
            running back to Elio, feeling his neck for a pulse to see that it
            was weak, the weakest I'd ever felt.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >But it was something. I dropped the phone beside me, continuing the
            CPR after I dialed Devil's number, and he picked up, voice groggy.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"Z?" </i></p>
        <p><i>"Medic!" I yelled, "Hurry up, it's Elio!" </i></p>
        <p><i>He cursed before the line cut. </i></p>
        <p>
          All that happened next was a blur. Casmiro had rushed in shortly after
          with medic, and soldiers were everywhere. I was still in shock, still
          couldn't process what had happened, and even when Angelo arrived the
          next day and asked who had found Elio, I still couldn't remember half
          of what he said. Still, I knew he had taken me away from the whole
          chaos and from a confused Devil who was having a conversation with
          Casmiro about Elio's health issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relatability in Angelo's eyes was something I would never forget.
          He thanked me, tried to talk me out of my head, told me about the
          first time he found Elio, told me about his sister, and eventually
          asked if he could trust me with sensitive information about Elio. I
          had told him yes, and He told me of Elio's special training in the
          army. I had been sad then, but the sadness that touched my insides
          didn't compare to my fury. It was a violation—all on the orders from
          his sick father.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sick father whom Elio seemed to believe was alive, in that motel,
          where he had almost tried to hurt himself, and his supposed father who
          had a gravestone right here in the compound, right beside his mother
          and siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't question it then because I had been more focused on getting
          him to give me the gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had made me promise not to tell anyone about his father being
          alive, But I had meant it when I told him there was nothing to tell
          because his father was dead, and he had been dead for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right off the bat, after he confirmed he faked the man's death, I had
          told him he needed help—and I had also meant that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now wasn't the time for thinking all that. Now was the time to
          talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should be on bed rest, Elio. You should be in bed, in that
          fucking hospital, resting; you should be on your way to get a fucking
          shrink to help you—in fact, I hope that's where you are getting ready
          to go."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"No?"</p>
        <p>
          <br />"I do not have time for this, Zahra," he stated plainly,
          reaching behind me to grab his suit from where it was hung as he put
          it on. "Give me the room keys; I have weeks' worth of work to see—"
        </p>
        <p>"Are you fucking serious?"</p>
        <p>
          He picked up his watch, fixing it around his wrist without looking up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you trying to act like you haven't been unconscious for a week
          after OD'ing?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He fixed his collar, gaze still not meeting mine. "I am fine now, no?
          Do I seem unwell to you?"
        </p>
        <p>"Elio," I called, trying to bring him back to his senses.</p>
        <p>"Room keys. Stop being a nuisance."</p>
        <p>"Can you even try to fucking look at me!" I yelled.</p>
        <p>
          His body stopped looking for things to distract itself with as he
          sighed, finally looking down at me, gaze locking with mine. No
          remorse. No regret. No guilt. Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>"Keys." He stated.</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, sniffing and wiping the tears from my eyes. "That's
          all you can say to me? Keys? Like it matters?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />"It does matter. You locked the door whilst you came in; I would
          need the keys to unlock the door in order for me to go out."
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my lip. "Elio...you almost died. Hours after your
          birthday, do you remember?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am aware. While it is quite unfortunate, I am now back, alive
          again, and everyone is happy, yes? I do not want to speak on it,
          neither do I want to dwell on a past that I cannot vividly remember,
          neither can I change, so if you would give me the <i>fucking</i> keys
          and let me go my way, that would be most appreciated."
        </p>
        <p>"No. I want to talk about this now."</p>
        <p>
          "For the love of God, Zahra, I am barely managing to stay composed
          before you right now."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want your composure!" I yelled, sharply stepping closer to
          him. "I don't <i>need</i> your composure, Elio. I need to know how you
          feel, unearth. Tell me. Explain. Give me something. Anything to make
          this guilt stop eating me from the inside out because I have spent all
          through this week thinking this is all my fault! Thinking you tried to
          hurt yourself because of me, so please, just <i>talk</i> to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever mask he had been wearing slipped off him instantly as he
          closed the remaining distance between us, cupping both sides of my
          face in his hand, thumbs going to my cheeks to wipe the tears before
          they could fall even further down. "No...never...this was not your
          fault. Please do not blame yourself. You have no reason to blame
          yourself."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not the party?"</p>
        <p>
          "No, No, Zahra, of course not. The party was astounding. I loved it. I
          was happy. I don't know what happened. I wanted to sleep. I was tired,
          and I went to take my pills to help me. I took two of them, and then I
          woke up today and learned I had been unconscious for days."
        </p>
        <p>"You took more than two, Elio. You took everything."</p>
        <p>
          Silence followed; he stood watching me for a few beats before He
          dropped his hands from my face, his fingers raking through his hair,
          ruining the arrangement. "I have no idea what you want me to say. I
          cannot remember what I did; my mind has blocked it off because I
          wasn't there at that moment."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay...then get help, get help so that this doesn't happen again."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, stepping back from me and turning to the bed, "I do
          not wish to."
        </p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"<i>Because</i> I do not wish to."</p>
        <p>
          I rushed around him until we were face to face again. Unable to
          continue this conversation in English, I switched to Spanish. "Why the
          fuck are you so stubborn about this!"
        </p>
        <p>"I do not have to answer to you."</p>
        <p>
          "Don't give me that bullshit!" I yelled, shaking my head. "You clearly
          need help, and you will get it. You like it or you don't."
        </p>
        <p>
          The softness that had been in his eyes vanished. "Who do you think you
          are?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "One of the many people who cares if you live or you fucking die. You
          will treat yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          His laugh was humorless. "Honestly, it would do you good to forget it
          happened."
        </p>
        <p>"Forget?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Forget it; erase it from your memories because I will never heed
          your wishes. It is not what I want."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "Right," my eyes searched this. "That's all right. But know
          this: if you don't get help, I don't think I can be in this
          relationship."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, you would proceed to be toxic by trying to end the
          relationship because I don't agree with you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          That had my eyes widening, fury scratching painfully on my skin.
          "Toxic? <i>I</i> am toxic?"
        </p>
        <p>"Very. If you weren't aware."</p>
        <p><i>Is this motherfucker—</i></p>
        <p>
          "You wanna know what's toxic?" I gave him a pointed glare, sharpening
          my arrows. Stepping closer to him, I didn't break eye contact, "You
          really wanna know what's toxic, Elio?"
        </p>
        <p>His jaw clenched, but he didn't speak.</p>
        <p>
          "It's waking up," I poked his chest. "In the middle of the fucking
          night, walking to the bathroom, and seeing you lying there...pale,
          cold and not breathing." He didn't move back as I moved forward, my
          chest brushing his, "You wanna know what else is toxic? It's me using
          these hands," I brought my palms before me, placing them on his chest,
          "To try—" I sucked in a breath, "to try and bring you back to
          life...over." I pushed him, and he stumbled back, "Over," I hit his
          chest in a push that had him stumbling back again. "And over again,"
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "Toxic? Toxic is the fucking fear I felt for you! It's the fucking
          tears I cried for you! It's my heart breaking seeing the look on your
          brother's face when you were carried out, looking like you wouldn't
          make it through the night, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sniffed, wiping my cheeks. "I'll be damned a thousand times over if
          I choose to accept your death wish and hold fear in my heart for the
          rest of my life, waiting for the last shoe to drop. If you won't get
          help, then this is done. I'm sorry, but I won't go through that
          again."
        </p>
        <p>Another silence reigned.</p>
        <p>
          His gaze was unsteady as he looked at me, something like defeat
          lingering in his stare; it was heavy, it was dark, it was breaking,
          and it was sad. He took a few steps away from me before taking off his
          suit and dropping it on the bed, sitting beside it, and running his
          palms down his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was silent between us. Him with his palms covering his face,
          fingers massaging the side of his head like he was trying to keep down
          his headache, and me at the other side of the room, trying to calm the
          raging beating of my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he nodded and spoke. "I understand." His eyes met mine as he
          brought his hands back down, his right thumb finger digging into the
          palm of his left hand. "I understand if you want to leave me. I would
          hate to put you in that position again—I am sorry that I put you in
          that position—If I could have predicted that it would happen, I would
          not have—" he stopped, his head dropping as he looked down at hands
          and shook his head slightly.
        </p>
        <p>It was silent once more, and my nerves were skyrocketing.</p>
        <p>
          <br />He glanced up at me, eyes sad, dark, red-rimmed—he was
          withholding tears, trying to control emotions begging to be let out.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked back down at his hands, stopping them from shaking by
          digging his thumb deeper into his palm. The rigid flex on his biceps
          and the clench in his jaw told me how hard he was trying to hold
          himself together.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand if you want out. But to be sincere with you...I don't
          want you to leave me, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked up again, and I caught the glistening in his eyes. "If you
          leave me, then I don't—I don't know what I am living for." He managed
          a slight shrug, "It's not Elia because I already decided to end it
          all, even with him in my life. You are my constant Zahra; if you go, I
          have no reason to hold back." A tear slid down his cheek. "I don't
          know how long I'll last here if you walk out that door."
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, "You can't tell me that,"</p>
        <p>
          "It's the truth," he said, keeping his eyes locked with mine. "Eres mi
          vida, Zahra." <i>You are my life, Zahra.</i>
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, "No,"</p>
        <p>"Eres mi vida."</p>
        <p>
          "No. No, I'm not. You can't say that to me when you refuse to protect
          the life you claim is mine. Not when you want to take it away from
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          A frown dropped his brows, hurt swirling in his eyes, "You think I
          want that?" he asked, "You think I want to take my life? I gave up
          revenge because I chose to be here for you; I chose this, I did, I
          <i>want</i> to live. I already made that decision when you became a
          constant, but my mind doesn't get that I want to live. It doesn't
          understand that I don't want to die. My mind wants to die because it's
          tired, Zahra. And I am tired of it; I am tired of my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am tired of the person that I am; I am tired of hearing my name. Of
          this weakness and abnormality, I am just so tired of spending my life
          being this person who fights daily to be normal. I <i>long</i> to be
          normal. You have no idea how bad I wish you never got to see this side
          of me; you don't know how ashamed I am of even being in the same space
          with you, knowing what you had to go through to bring me back." He
          looked down again, "I don't want you to leave me, but I will accept it
          if that is what you want."
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked towards him, crouching before his body and holding his hand
          in mine.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio," I called softly, "look at me,"</p>
        <p>
          He raised his gaze, and I let my hand reach his cheek, wiping his
          tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want to leave you, either. I want you to let me in. Let me
          see where exactly the problem is coming from. I want you to walk me
          through that darkness in your head. Let me in so we can figure this
          out together. Please, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>He pursed his lips, and then softly, he nodded.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed in relief as I pushed his suit to the side and took the space
          beside him.
        </p>
        <p>He intertwined our fingers but didn't look at me.</p>
        <p>
          "Sometimes," he started. "Sometimes I have this feeling..." he trailed
          off, seeming lost. "This feeling like I'm outside of my body, like a
          stranger, looking in...it doesn't happen often, but when it does, I
          become a complete stranger to myself. And anything I do in that moment
          becomes action...without feelings. Without self-consciousness. I must
          admit that was how I felt throughout the birthday party.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we were together in the shower, I wanted that moment to feel
          real. I chanted it so many times in my head due to how badly I wanted
          to make it real...and while it did feel like that for that moment, I
          lost it again. Everything else that happened...I can't really
          remember. It was like a time-lapse in my head. It all moved too fast."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was silent between us again...he wanted to say more, and I waited
          patiently for him to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          He swallowed, tightening his hold on my hand. "I see things
          too...sometimes. I see my mother, and I hear her voice. When she
          touches me, it feels real and familiar, but I know she's not there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also hear voices from people I've met and talked to over the years.
          Sometimes, they're loud; sometimes, they're just murmurs; sometimes,
          they make me talk out loud and hallucinate. I can't sleep because it
          brings hallucinations, vivid ones that are—that are of things that I
          have done...
        </p>
        <p>One particular thing...a kid. A little boy.</p>
        <p>The first person I ever killed.</p>
        <p>
          I see—I see him all the time; he stands at random places all over the
          house...watching me, taunting me...Sometimes, I beg him to leave and
          tell him I never meant to do it; sometimes, I just pick up my gun and
          shoot at him until he disappears. Sometimes I don't even know if I
          shoot at him because it's all in my head, and I am so tired, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>"Do you think it's something? Like an illness?"</p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "Yes. My mother was schizophrenic. So, it might be some
          genetic situation. It's not common to be passed on to—to children, and
          I wasn't always like this...I didn't have delusions or
          hallucinations...it started after killing someone for the first time.
          It wasn't often but—but it was there."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked up at me, the tiredness reflecting in his eyes, "I sometimes
          think when my mind can't cope, and when it all gets too much, I have
          that out-of-body experience, and I do things that I don't mean to do
          or say things that I don't mean to say. It's a never-ending cycle, and
          I really, really want it to end."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know it doesn't have to end in you dying, right? You could get
          help."
        </p>
        <p>He looked away from me. "I can't."</p>
        <p>
          "Why?" I asked, trying to catch his gaze. "Is this because you think
          you're underserving of it?"
        </p>
        <p>"I know I am. I am positive I am underserving of it."</p>
        <p>
          "Angelo told me about what you suspect was done to you in the army."
        </p>
        <p>He sighed heavily.</p>
        <p>
          "Elio, I think they were made to make you believe you're undeserving
          of help."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Possibly. My father was hell-bent on never getting me medical help,
          so there is a possibility that was one part of the special training."
        </p>
        <p>"So why are you still heeding to it?"</p>
        <p>
          "Because I can't stop. Because my father is alive and—and I don't
          think I will ever stop heeding to what they did to me at the camp—as
          long as he's there, as long as he's still breathing."
        </p>
        <p>
          My stomach sank as I watched him, hoping to God that my suspicions
          weren't true. "You could put an end to it today."
        </p>
        <p>His eyes searched mine, "To kill him?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. He is one of your demons, the block in your path, and if you
          don't kill that demon, I don't think you'll move forward, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          He was listening to me; I saw the resignation in his eyes as he
          nodded. "Will you come with me? I don't think I can do it alone."
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed, and it was almost painful. "Yeah, sure."</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          He took no security detail. No one questioned us leaving the compound,
          but I sent a quick text to Angelo, Casmiro, and Devil, telling them
          that all was well and that I might have gotten him to get help
          finally.
        </p>
        <p><i>I might have. </i></p>
        <p>But we had to take care of this situation.</p>
        <p>
          The drive took an hour and almost forty minutes, but we arrived at the
          motel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him greet the receptionist, who looked at me with surprise,
          probably in shock that he brought someone here after so many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my heart in my throat, my body buzzing, and my chest tight, I
          followed Elio down the hallway, which held yellow lights that gave the
          space a warm feel and somehow added to my nerves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The jangle of keys as he stopped right in front of a door and
          proceeded to unlock it had my heart pounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I heard two lock clicks, and he pushed the door open, I braced
          myself as he walked in, and I followed behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I closed the door, I looked up as he pointed to the middle of the
          room. "There he is,"
        </p>
        <p>My gaze settled on the chair facing the window.</p>
        <p><i>My God.</i></p>
        <p>I couldn't speak because my heart was breaking.</p>
        <p>I felt his eyes on me. "Why are you quiet?"</p>
        <p>
          Swallowing, I looked up at him, at the question in his eyes. "There's
          no one there, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          His frown drew down slowly before he looked back to the chair in a
          double take.
        </p>
        <p>He froze, also growing quiet.</p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "He was just there," he stepped forward, looking confused. "He was
          just here, now."
        </p>
        <p>"There was—"</p>
        <p>
          "No, He was just—I saw him seconds ago..." he trailed off, shaking his
          head like something wasn't adding up.
        </p>
        <p>"Elio,"</p>
        <p>
          "No," he shook his head again, his breathing frantic as the seconds
          passed. "No, I know what I'm talking about. He was sitting here when
          we walked in, Zahra." he gripped the neck of the chair. "He was here;
          I know what I saw," his eyes fell to me. "You didn't see him?"
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head slowly.</p>
        <p>
          "That's impossible..." he blinked. "That's impossible...that's
          impossible," he repeated.
        </p>
        <p>Cautiously, I took a single step forward, "Elio, it's okay—"</p>
        <p>
          "No," The confusion in his voice was evident. "No, he is always here."
          He looked back at the chair, chest heaving. "You don't understand
          Zahra. I talk to him, I always—I always come here to talk to him," he
          looked back at me. "I would bring food, and he would eat and—no—he's
          here, maybe he—when I looked at you—The bathroom..." He said as he
          rushed to the other side of the room, pulling the door and stopping
          dead when he found no one.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, there's no one here," I said softly, unable to stop my voice
          from shaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned sharply to me, his eyes unfocused as he walked back to where
          I stood, putting his hand on my shoulders, his breathing unleveled,
          shaking like his body was. "You have to believe me."
        </p>
        <p>"I believe you,"</p>
        <p>"No, you do not; you're looking at me like you think I'm crazy."</p>
        <p>I shook my head. "I don't think you're crazy, Elio."</p>
        <p>He looked intently into my eyes. "Then you saw him?"</p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>
          "I faked his death, Zahra. Everyone thinks he's dead, but I left him
          alive because I had this—I had a plan, you have to believe me, he was
          here, he is always here, and we talk, and he talks to me—the last
          time, the last time I was here, I hit him, I felt him—"
        </p>
        <p>"Just like you feel your mother?"</p>
        <p>He went quiet.</p>
        <p>
          "Elio, you told me that you saw your mother. You felt her touch you.
          She seemed real, but you knew she wasn't there. With schizophrenia,
          you tend to have delusions and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He let go of me, repeatedly shaking his head as he paced the room.
          "No, no, that's different. I can—I can differentiate it, I know when
          it's real or not—my father—my father was—that man was real, he was
          here, he was the reason I started this whole thing. I wanted—he was
          here because I wanted him to feel how my mother and brother and sister
          felt in that fire, we were supposed to—we were—it was—this was—" he
          was breaking right before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Everyone knows he had an attack," I said softly. "A heart attack that
          killed him, and it was rumored that you were the only one in the room,
          so technically, everyone thought you caused it..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Tears fell from his eyes, his breathing falling from his mouth now,
          loud as he shook his head and paced, recalling what I just laid out.
          "No, no, no, no, he was—I remember that day, we were—we were arguing,
          okay? And he—and he fell—he didn't die—he didn't die, Zahra, he didn't
          die because he doesn't get to die like that. So I faked it—right? I
          faked his death, and I brought him here, with me—and he's been here
          since then, and everyone thinks he's dead and buried, but he's not—I
          know—I know because I see him, I see him here, you have to believe me
          please,"
        </p>
        <p>"Elio, it's okay—"</p>
        <p>
          "It's not!" he yelled. "He can't be dead because I didn't want him
          dead...not yet! He couldn't have had it so easy when they didn't get
          to have it easy. When I don't have it ea—sy!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He broke. Crumbling to his knees, both hands covered his eyes, and
          sobs left him...ragged and pained.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was in front of him the next instant, gathering him into my arms,
          hugging him tight as I cried, breaking while he broke. "It's okay,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He wrapped his arms around me, buried his face in the crook of my
          neck, and cried, the wetness from his eyes touching my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I killed them, Zahra." he muffled out. "I wasn't there...I wasn't
          there to save them; I should have never left them. It's all my fault."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not. It's not your fault."</p>
        <p>
          "But they were screaming for me—if you could have heard it—God Zahra,
          they were screaming my name, and I wasn't there...I was too
          late...they were gone...they were dead, I couldn't even—I couldn't
          even recognize them, couldn't—they were—it was bad...it was—they
          didn't—there was no skin—there was nothing—I couldn't bury anything—I
          couldn't do anything, and I can't even tell them I'm sorry."
        </p>
        <p>"They know," I rubbed his back. "They know you're sorry,"</p>
        <p>
          "But they hate me—they would know that I didn't—I didn't kill him for
          letting it happen. I didn't take revenge for them—I didn't do
          anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          I held him tighter. "I know you would hate to hear this, Elio, but
          sometimes...revenge isn't the only solution...all you need is a good
          cry, a good talk, a good sleep, and acceptance. You haven't allowed
          yourself to move on after all these years, and I am positive they
          would have wanted you to be happy. I don't think they hate you; that
          is just what you think. You need to, for once, take care of yourself,
          your thoughts, your mind...you need these things to function, and only
          when you own them will you be happy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled away, and he looked at me; his eyes were so red, so broken,
          as I held his face. "My presence in your life can only do so much. You
          said it yourself. You tried to bring yourself back even when you were
          with me, and you did, but you lost the grip on your mind again, even
          with me in the picture. If you—if you use me as an anchor, it's only a
          matter of time before I lose the weight to keep your mind afloat, your
          problems will sink my presence, and you will drown even with me
          there...it's happening already, that's why you have to treat yourself,
          <i>please</i>."
        </p>
        <p>His throat worked, and he nodded. "Okay."</p>
        <p>"Okay?"</p>
        <p>"Yes. I will get help."</p>
        <p>"You're not making false promises?"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, shoulders slumped. "No. I want to get help, and I
          will get help. Now. I will see a specialist now, if possible...If
          you'll come with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't fight the smile as it grew on my lips. I wrapped my arms
          around him, hugging him. "I will. I'll be there with you, and I'll
          hold your hands, and I'll do whatever I can to help you through this."
        </p>
        <p>
          He relaxed into my arms, and the space that had opened up in my heart
          for him opened even wider, and I closed my eyes, hugging him back to
          calm while accepting that I didn't just like this man, neither was I
          just fond of him—no—realization made goosebumps rise on my skin as I
          held on to him even tighter.
        </p>
        <p>I was falling in love with Elio Marino.</p>
        <p>Hell...</p>
        <p>I think I already fell.</p>

        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /><br /></p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Hey you.</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>Me:</b><br /><b
            >So, since you're in London for the week, STREET and I would like to
            use ur house for the map deciphering. We need good security and
            space, and ur home is perfect for it because of its safety and
            freedom within the compound. I promise we won't touch the wine or
            whiskey collection.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Please...</b></p>
        <p>
          "There, I sent it. Give it a few seconds, and we'll get our yes, some
          expensive wine and a clear mind to get to work." I said to everyone
          gathered around the table of the apartment Angelo's people had gotten
          for us upon our arrival back to Milan. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil offered me a pointed stare. "I see no reason why we should go to
          the compound. There's enough security here and enough space."
        </p>
        <p>"It's the wine," I answered.</p>
        <p>"And the kitchen," Dog added.</p>
        <p>
          "The game room, too; I got lost in there at that party," Upper joined.
          "Have you ever tried drinking good alcohol while having a wild 3D
          experience with cars you know you could never drive?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "There are also many picture spots for Instagram." Milk shrugged,
          "Fake it till you make it." She held a fist bump to me, and I jammed
          my fist with hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil sighed, "It all depends on his response. Besides, if Dog plans
          to cook, he will thrash the kitchen; Elio doesn't like a mess."
        </p>
        <p>I narrowed my eyes, keeping silent.</p>
        <p>"The fuck is you trying to imply? That I'm a messy cook?"</p>
        <p>"Yup,"</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra and I will help him clean," Milk said, "Besides, isn't Elio
          going to be back in a week or something?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A week and a few days," I answered, not exactly knowing or caring to
          know what kind of work he had traveled to do. He told me, but I had
          zoned out when he started talking about governors and politics—and I
          might have mentioned the word 'awesome' too many times—which he had
          innocently taken as my keen interest in the topic. However, I couldn't
          understand the meaning of half the words he used while talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "See," Milk grinned. "That's enough time to clean up whatever mess we
          make."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I'm a fool to believe you guys would leave that house today if he
          actually says yes," Devil said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shrugged. "I mean...it's not like he'd be back today or
          something...it's a long week. A big house, with amazing drinks, and a
          good game room, with a fully stocked kitchen, very spacious,
          absolutely luxurious. A mini cinema room. Why the hell wouldn't you
          want that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper tilted his head at Devil. "Weren't you given some privileges in
          the compound? We literally do not need permission when we have you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, why don't we use the brother." The sarcasm from Devil's statement
          didn't seem to reach Upper.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no, I mean, don't you plan on using some of those privileges?"
          Upper asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're still trying to build our relationship; I don't think being
          overbearing is the right thing at the moment."
        </p>
        <p>Upper's brows shot up, eyes widening in surprise. "Wow."</p>
        <p>
          Devil frowned at the tone, gaze falling directly on the dark-haired
          boy who had returned to focusing on the complicated map.
        </p>
        <p>"What's wow?" Devil asked</p>
        <p>"Nothing. I didn't say anything." Upper said.</p>
        <p>"If you have something to say, say it, don't be a coward."</p>
        <p>
          "Bloody hell, relax," Upper met his stare, "I have nothing to say to
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Guys," Milk cut in. "No need to fight; let's just hear what Marino
          says, and then we can move forward."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," I supported, watching the little stare down in which Upper
          broke with a shake of his head and a frown. I cleared my throat. "I
          understand where D's coming from, but I think Elio might want us in
          the compound for whatever heist work we want to do. The only reason
          why we are outside the compound is his little show of making it clear
          to us that we're not his prisoners and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          A sound pinged from my phone, and I rushed to grab it from the table,
          knowing it was his response.
        </p>
        <p><b>Big Baby:</b><br /><b>No.</b></p>
        <p>I blinked at the message. So abrupt. So decisive. So. Fucking...</p>
        <p>
          I blew a calm breath and remembered that his intention wasn't to sound
          mean.
        </p>
        <p>"He said no,"</p>
        <p>
          Dog's eyes widened. "Now, what kind of boyfriend denies his girlfriend
          entry to his house when he's not home? Sure you both are in love?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I gave him the middle finger, my shoulders slumping. "I guess we're
          stuck here for the week."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hell no, I didn't spend all through last night thinking of drinking
          that addictive wine and cooking in that kitchen to end up in this
          decent fucking dump." Dog removed his feet from the table, pinning
          Devil with a stare. "You're gonna text him and ask."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where's the logic?" Devil asked him with a bored look, "Why do you
          think he'd say no to her and yes to me? She <i>literally</i> just
          asked him <i>minutes</i> ago. He's totally not going to sense
          something weird going on. At all." Sarcasm, again, which meant he was
          growing annoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a gamble. If you do it and he rejects, then fine, we'll stick to
          the decent fucking dump, but if you don't do it, we'll just break into
          his house and the compound, possibly die if we're caught—or get
          injured or some sad shit where we'd probably lose Upper in the
          process—"
        </p>
        <p>"Why me—"</p>
        <p>
          "What do you dig?" Dog spoke over Upper's voice, watching Devil
          intently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil's jaw locked; his gaze steadied to Dog, who raised a challenging
          brow.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a groan, Devil reached for his phone in his pocket and started
          typing furiously while reading aloud what he typed. "Hello brother,
          can I and STREET stay in your condo to sort out some stuff we can also
          sort out in our own condo—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tell him we won't touch the wine," Milk quickly added, earning a
          glare from Devil, but he continued typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We won't touch your wine collection unless we decide to touch your
          wine collection, which we probably will—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tell him we might cook too." Milk added again, earning another sharp
          glare.
        </p>
        <p>But Devil continued typing.</p>
        <p>
          "We will use and thrash your kitchen and will probably miss a stain on
          the counter, which you might come back to meet. It will probably
          irritate you until you decide to move out, so please, it is very,
          <i>very</i> okay to say no to my request to stay in your condo when we
          can as well stay in ours. Send." He dropped his phone by his side.
          "There, done."
        </p>
        <p>
          "How in hell's arse do you think he will ever say yes to
          <i>you,</i> basically telling <i>him</i> to say no?" Upper asked.
        </p>
        <p>"I did what the Dog asked me to do."</p>
        <p>"Point of fucking correction, it's just Dog."</p>
        <p>"That's what I said," Devil answered.</p>
        <p>
          "No, you said 'the' Dog, which just made it seem like you were calling
          me a dog. And you've done that like a couple of times before, and I
          have corrected you a couple of times before, but a fucking douchebag
          will always continue to be a fucking douchebag."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I won't stop until all of you stop trying to use my supposed last
          name as some ticket to getting away with shit you indirectly pull with
          my brother."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, "That's not what we're trying to do, and it's not like he's
          gonna say yes anyway."
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk nodded. "Upper's right; you kinda did tell him that it was okay
          to say no, and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil's phone pinged, and we all went quiet as he picked it up, swiped
          up at the screen, and widened his eyes. "He...said yes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What!" I yelled, snatching the phone from his hand and bringing it to
          my view.
        </p>
        <p><b>Elio:</b><br /><b>Of course. Anything you want. </b></p>
        <p>My jaw dropped. "What the fuck?"</p>
        <p>
          Milk peeked from my shoulder and cooed. "Aw, He said anything you
          want! Ugh, to have a big brother...think he's looking to adopt?"
        </p>
        <p>Devil grabbed his phone from my grip.</p>
        <p>
          "No, he is not." And then he looked to Dog, who relaxed back on his
          chair. "Happy?"
        </p>
        <p>
          With a smirk, Dog responded, "I knew he would say yes. Who wouldn't do
          anything for a brother who has never asked him for anything like that
          before? Simple logic." His gaze landed on me. "He also probably said
          no to you because he knows you're always up to no good, or you guys
          probably got into a fight we don't know about, or...he doesn't really
          fancy you." his smile was proud. "Again. Simple logic. You're all
          welcome."
        </p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes and fought the urge to call and give Elio a piece of
          my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hadn't gotten into any fight; in fact, I was mainly at the compound
          all through last week, and I followed him to most of his therapy
          sessions. We talked, we ate, we had sex, we hung out, we were perfect,
          and I was positive that he most definitely—to Dog's fucking
          disappointment—fancied me. Plenty.
        </p>
        <p>Or does he?</p>
        <p>Or is this how he'd act with any other woman he fancies?</p>
        <p>Does he fancy any other woman?</p>
        <p>No. Nope. I'm not thinking this.</p>
        <p>
          We spent the next hour packing up our things and heading out. When we
          got to the compound, we were escorted by a few soldiers who had only
          addressed Devil with the same respect they would have given Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frown on Devil's face didn't exactly tell me if he liked the new
          attention or the power—it reminded me a lot of the times when Elio
          would frown, and you wouldn't be able to tell exactly why he was
          frowning or what might have triggered his silent anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The urge to call the mean man tugged at me, and surprisingly, it was
          not to call him out on him saying no to me and yes to Devil. It was to
          hear his voice—even if we had been on the phone hours ago when he had
          called to check up on me. For no reason at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know small gestures like that could make the heart flutter,
          but it made mine flutter. I had rolled my eyes, but I could still not
          stop the smile from curling on my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all settled in the huge kitchen, Upper setting his laptop on the
          mini dining table, which was for—I don't know—food tasting? A much
          grander dining table was a closed door away—an entirely different
          room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spread the map on the table, and Milk laid out notes to put down
          coordinates and make our own description of the map while Devil
          studied it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog popped open a bottle of expensive wine while trying to find
          something good and fast to cook.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Arturo Garza was either a phony motherfucker or a mad genius who knew
          how to make simple coordinates seem like the bane of everyone's
          existence." I pointed out with a sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We just need to find the key to whatever lock he had placed on it. If
          we can break through one coordinate, we can break through the rest."
          Devil said. "All that matters is that the location of the gold and
          those flash drives are hidden in this madness somewhere; we just gotta
          open our eyes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Every possible coordinate suggestion I have run has come back without
          a probable location. I feel like we're missing something." Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe the wine would help," I looked up towards the kitchen just in
          time to find Dog dropping the opened wine bottle and crouching down.
          "Dog? The wine glass shelf is literally behind you; what's taking so
          long."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's a locked cupboard here," he said, and the sound of him trying
          to pick the lock reached our ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If it's locked, then leave it." Devil responded, "It literally means
          the person who locked it wanted no one to open it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why would someone have more than five unlocked cupboards in a kitchen
          and lock the sixth one? Doesn't that make you guys curious?" Dog
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Nope," Upper answered him.</p>
        <p>
          "Just leave the damn cupboard, and come here, we have shit to do, and
          we need alcohol to think straight," I said, looking back down at the
          map with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm curious," Milk spoke up.</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, pinky brain, Devil, Zahra, and Upper have become so," the
          sound of the cupboard coming open reached us, "Boring these days—what
          do we have here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up with a frown as Dog rose to his feet, holding a big yellow
          gift box in his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A locked away birthday present." Dog said, looking at both sides of
          the box as he walked out from behind the counter and straight towards
          us.
        </p>
        <p>"We shouldn't be snooping," I said, eying the box.</p>
        <p>
          Dog dropped the box on the table, looking at me like I had lost my
          mind. "Your boyfriend has an unwrapped birthday gift designed in
          sparkly yellow shit, locked in a cupboard in his kitchen, and you
          still think we shouldn't be snooping?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't see this amongst the gifts he received, and I was in charge
          of the presents." Milk said with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We need to learn to leave shit alone," Devil said, eyes on the box.
          "But...even if we open it, it's not like he's gonna know, right?"
        </p>
        <p>We all looked at him. Surprised.</p>
        <p>"Upper," I called, straightening. "security cams."</p>
        <p>
          "Way ahead of you," he said, his fingers jamming on the keyboard of
          his laptop before he connected a USB chord from his phone to the
          laptop, typed some more, and then nodded. "We're on loop, not for
          long."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog opened the box, and I frowned. Yellow petals were everywhere, but
          amidst was an average-sized yellow teddy bear with a huge heart-shaped
          design between its hands, the words: <b>Happy Birthday, Elio!</b> Sewn
          to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow, someone went to great lengths to make a customized teddy
          bear..." Milk said.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were other things inside: Several cholate bars, all with yellow
          packaging, a wine bottle by the side, beautifully painted sea
          shells—all colorful and handmade, a beautiful glass casing that housed
          a set of silver rings, a cute yellow mug with his name on it, a yellow
          tie, and a card, which Dog picked up.
        </p>
        <p>My heart was hammering, and I was very fucking confused.</p>
        <p>The person who had sent this had made this box with extra care.</p>
        <p>He had hidden it.</p>
        <p>Why had Elio hidden it? And who sent it?</p>
        <p>
          "From some Gemma Parisi," Dog spoke up like he had heard my thoughts.
          As he read the card, a frown drew his brows down, deeper and deeper
          and deeper, heightening my anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>"What does it say?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          He looked up at me, eyes guarded. "Uh..." he drawled out.
          "Nothing...nothing uh...just some—"
        </p>
        <p>"Let me see." I outstretched my hand towards him.</p>
        <p>
          Dog looked to Devil like he was asking for help and then to Upper, who
          looked scared for me. It seemed like the three boys had shared a brief
          conversation in their heads with only that quick eye contact.
        </p>
        <p>"What's happening." Milk asked, looking around the table.</p>
        <p>"Hand over the fucking card, Dog."</p>
        <p>
          He sighed, passing it to me. I snatched it from his grip, and my
          stomach dropped as I read.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>I blinked, and the card shook in my hand.</p>
        <p>
          Milk dropped back down to the chair. I hadn't realized she had been
          behind me before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil collected the card, and I dropped my hands with a disappointed
          sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let's not...jump to conclusions; that is totally out of context,
          right Milk?" Dog said, and Milk shook her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper whistled, sitting back down, having read the card with Devil,
          who placed it back inside the box and covered it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still couldn't process what I had just read and what it could have
          meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart quickly ran to my throat, knowing Elio might have some other
          woman on the side who could possibly have a kid for him. A little girl
          named Sailor?
        </p>
        <p>
          But then again, I knew that man—<i>or I thought I did</i>. He would
          never do that to me.
        </p>
        <p>To anyone.</p>
        <p>
          Elio would never hurt me like that. It was out of his character...
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >You thought Martino would never drop you because he was obsessed.
            But he did right after he found a new obsession while still
            obsessing over you...</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, "Did he ever mention her to you?" I asked Devil.</p>
        <p>
          Devil met my gaze. "Of course not. I have no idea who she is. Never
          heard him mention her."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>"You all right?" Upper asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Look her up. I have to know who she is. This doesn't make any sense."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper nodded as he got to work on that. We all settled behind him.
        </p>
        <p>He typed her name into a private illegal database network.</p>
        <p>
          A grainy picture of her ID card came up with her address, old and new.
          Height, weight, Highschool and college details, birth certificate, and
          other useless information like her bank statements and shit I didn't
          care to know about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The face on the ID card was what drew me in. I couldn't see much of
          it, but I recognized that blonde hair, and I swear my heart skipped a
          fucking beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gemma Parisi, 26. France and Italian descent, parents died when she
          was 5, a brutal car accident, and she's been living with her grandma
          ever since." Upper summarized from the little he could pick up from
          the details I didn't see.
        </p>
        <p>"She dog sits and babysits?" Milk mused aloud.</p>
        <p>
          "Yup. Income is nothing to write about, but it's enough for two."
          Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>Devil frowned, "Is this legit?"</p>
        <p>"Yup. She's clean." Upper said.</p>
        <p>
          "Too clean," Dog muttered. "Too clean, it's unnatural. Can you dig
          more into the parents?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper navigated the cursor, and another tab opened, revealing two
          other ID cards for her mother and father. "Mother was a social worker;
          Dad was a constructor. His criminal records aren't spotless,
          vandalism, arson—but those are dated back to his teenage years,
          nothing suspicious in recent times prior to his death."
        </p>
        <p>"The cause of the car accident?" Devil asked.</p>
        <p>"Collision. A truck driver." Upper answered.</p>
        <p>"The truck driver still breathing?" Dog asked.</p>
        <p>
          Upper typed something, and another tab opened. "Uh...was in a coma for
          a couple of months, but he died soon after. He was a normal guy, too."
        </p>
        <p>"Huh..." Dog said. "So, she's actually clean."</p>
        <p>"Yes," Upper said.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not getting any bad vibes either," Devil said. "Which means Elio
          isn't acquainted with her for business purposes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can the database provide more pictures of her? She looks familiar."
          Milk said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. The only picture we can get from here is the one from her ID, but
          we can check Instagram." Upper opened a tab that already had his
          Instagram account on display. He went to the search tab and typed out
          her name.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many Gemma Parisi's, but one caught us after looking
          through the names. This one had a single underscore before her full
          name. When Upper clicked on it, my heart stopped.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh my God," I said breathlessly.</p>
        <p>"You know her?" Devil asked.</p>
        <p>
          "She was—she's the one from the cruise." Milk spoke up. "The one who
          was looking at Elio!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And the one who came to his suite and said she had directional
          issues—" I raked my fingers through my hair, gripping it as my chest
          tightened with hurt. "Oh my God, how could I be so stupid?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Devil was quick to interject in my mini breakdown. "It might
          not be—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit," Upper said, drawing our attention. "They went together.
          There's a picture of the private jet—and...there's Elio."
        </p>
        <p>"This motherfucker." Dog gritted out.</p>
        <p>Seeing the picture, I looked away, feeling betrayed.</p>
        <p>Cheated.</p>
        <p>Used.</p>
        <p>"Zahra—" Milk was rushing to me, but I quickly raised my hand.</p>
        <p>"I'm fine. I just need a little—a little space; I'll be back."</p>
        <p>
          I walked out of the kitchen area and down to Elio's bedroom. Only when
          I was inside, locking the door behind me, did I breathe. It was heavy,
          and my heart was breaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want to believe it. But I knew how fucking hard my senses had
          tried to tell me about this, but I had ignored it because I trusted
          him in that aspect—in that aspect and more—I didn't think he would do
          this. He had preached about his respect for women and how he wouldn't
          want to repeat what his father had done to his mother.
        </p>
        <p>But apparently, that was fucking bullshit. Elio was no different.</p>
        <p>I wouldn't cry.</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed the lump in my throat and blinked away the stupid sting
          and burn in my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>No. I wouldn't cry.</p>
        <p>
          This wouldn't be the first time somebody used me. No. But I would make
          sure to fucking hell it be the last. Last time, I would open my heart
          to someone and let them hurt me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he hadn't wanted me—if he had wanted that perfect fucking Barbie,
          why did he lead me on like this? Why would he make it seem as though I
          was the only one that he wanted?
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision blurred, and I shook my head with a frown, whipping out my
          phone as I paced the length of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anger came next. Mixing with the hurt as I opened his chat box and
          started typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I deleted the rubbish line of questions and typed out another again,
          but deleted it. My fingers were unsteady, and the anger inside me
          wanted me to say the most fucking meanest thing my being to come up
          with, and each time I typed it out, I ended up deleting again.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't want to hurt him.</p>
        <p>
          But he hurt me. <i>He</i> hurt me, so why am I sparing his feelings?
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't know how long I sat there, but I knew I was too ashamed to
          face STREET. Not after knowing they knew I wasn't good enough for
          Elio—and I was probably being played this whole time.
        </p>
        <p>Even Angelo knew about Gemma.</p>
        <p>
          "Fucking idiot," I whispered, letting my eyes grow wet, unable to stop
          the emotions swirling around my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I knew why Upper, Devil, and Dog had shared that look. They knew
          how bad it looked, they knew, and they probably pitied me.
        </p>
        <p><i>Pitied the foolish girl that I am. </i></p>
        <p>
          I was <i>indeed</i> foolish—I dared to step out of my comfort zone
          because my heart had led me down the wrong path again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except this time, my anger wasn't just anger. My heart thumped
          abnormally, each beat accompanied by hurt, loss, and disappointment.
          Feelings that made my limbs and my firm will very weak. How I quickly
          let myself fall for Elio—thinking he was possibly the sincerest man
          I'd ever meet regarding relationships. I should have known better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trusting someone this much was something I had always strived so hard
          not to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one time I decided to give in, I got cheated on. I still couldn't
          believe it.
        </p>
        <p>"Stupid girl," I whispered again.</p>
        <p>
          The vibration from my phone got me out of my thoughts. Sluggishly, I
          flipped over the device.
        </p>
        <p>He was calling.</p>
        <p>
          I watched it ring, wanting nothing more but to answer and hear what he
          had to say. But I couldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          The call cut off, and the phone started vibrating almost
          immediately—his nickname flashing on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I declined the call and switched off my phone as I got to my feet,
          pocketed the phone, and rushed out of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching the kitchen, the hushed conversations stopped when they
          spotted me.
        </p>
        <p>That damned box was still on the table.</p>
        <p>"We're going to find the bitch."</p>
        <p>
          Devil sighed. "Maybe you shouldn't jump right into conclusions. I know
          Elio; he would never hurt you like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you really know him? Is it written in the fucking forehead of
          every man to grace the earth, who would cheat and who wouldn't?"
        </p>
        <p>"Z, just—"</p>
        <p>
          "We're going to find her," I said, looking around the group. "Anyone
          who doesn't want to come with me, that's fine. I'll go on my own."
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "So, are we just gonna sit in this minivan until one of these proper
          people calls the cops on us?" Upper asked. "I cannot get my name into
          the system."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shut up, rich boy," Dog said, eyes scanning the neighborhood from his
          seat near the window at the back. "She's processing."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was biting my thumb finger, my leg bouncing as I pinned my gaze on
          the house through the closed window in the passenger's seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The house was average—perfect, just like the woman who lived there.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I still don't think Elio would do that." Milk said, scrolling through
          Gemma's Instagram profile like she had been doing since we left the
          compound. "He doesn't seem like that kind of guy."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I still think you should have heard him out. He's called every
          one, which means he has an actual excuse that might make sense." Devil
          said from beside me in the driver's seat.
        </p>
        <p>"Or he doesn't."</p>
        <p>"Z, just—"</p>
        <p>
          "No one answers his call. Doing that would be an act of betrayal, and
          I will never forgive any of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          The car was silent again as I looked away from the house. "I bet my
          whole life savings that he spends most of his time here, fucking
          hypocrite," I muttered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are we going in?" Devil asked with a sigh. "What exactly is your
          plan? We've been sitting here for over an hour now."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm thinking." I gritted out.</p>
        <p>
          "While we think!" Dog spoke up. "I'm starving and would like to
          distract myself. Why don't we play another reveal game."
        </p>
        <p>"Like last time?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Exactly. Last time, we shared the meaning of our names; this time,
          we'll share our real names. Who's in?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I let my head fall on the headrest and took everyone's quietness as
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll go first." Dog said. "You laugh, and I snap your necks." He
          cleared his throat. "My real name's Wesley Reagan."
        </p>
        <p>I pressed my lips together.</p>
        <p>
          "Your real name's Wesley?" Devil shot out without missing a beat,
          looking back at Dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah. But most people call me Reagan because I always tell them never
          to call me Wesley. Or I'll snap their necks." He said pointedly.
        </p>
        <p>"Right," Devil said.</p>
        <p>"Wesley is an okay name—just doesn't suit your face," Upper said.</p>
        <p>I sat up. "I really can't imagine—"</p>
        <p>
          "No comments from you, Zahra; I really don't wanna hear what you have
          to say about my name."
        </p>
        <p>"Then can I laugh?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, sure. We drove past a cemetery on the way here; laying you to
          rest will be easy. It's night, no one will see."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think the name Wesley is pretty...compared to mine." Milk said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's your name?" I asked, angling my body to look at the back seat.
        </p>
        <p>"Typical name...very common." She said.</p>
        <p>"Still wanna hear it." Dog said, watching her.</p>
        <p>She sucked in a breath. "It's Penelope. Last name's Canavan."</p>
        <p>"You look like a Penelope, unlike Wes," Devil said.</p>
        <p>"I swear to God, Devil. I swear to God."</p>
        <p>"Penelope is a beautiful name," I said.</p>
        <p>
          "I agree, it is not bad, dear Pen," Upper said, lightly tapping her
          head.
        </p>
        <p>Dog didn't comment on her name.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll go next," Upper said, clearing his throat and rubbing his hands
          together. "I'm Archibald Avington Otto Farraday, the fourth—or fifth,
          I can't be sure...I didn't stay in the palace long enough to study the
          family history book before I was booted out, so I don't know exactly
          how many Avingtons they were before me."
        </p>
        <p>"I can't remember anything you just said." Dog voiced.</p>
        <p>"Me too," I admitted.</p>
        <p>Laughing, Upper relaxed on his seat. "My name's Archie."</p>
        <p>"I knew," Devil said, looking out the window.</p>
        <p>"How?" Upper asked.<br /></p>
        <p>
          Devil's response was a shrug, and that was that. He wasn't divulging
          how he knew. "Everyone knows my last name. My first name's Elia."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That sounds like a girl's name. Like the female version of Elio."
        </p>
        <p>Devil groaned and gritted. "It's unisex."</p>
        <p>"Your father was cruel." Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "He disowned me when I was 6. Right after killing my mother in front
          of me. Cruel doesn't do him justice." Devil said, bringing a bit of
          silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I broke the silence with a clearing of my throat. "Well..." I spoke,
          quickly calculating the consequences of what I was about to reveal.
          But Elio's people knew it and still didn't know <i>me</i>. I was also
          positive Devil and Dog hadn't caught on to Chika using my last name
          after he had us on the school bus.
        </p>
        <p>"My name's Zahra. Zahra Faizan."</p>
        <p>I caught the instant freeze on Devil's shoulders.</p>
        <p>
          I stopped short when he looked at me, and I caught the recognition in
          his eyes; his brows were furrowed just a bit as he observed me like I
          had spoken a lie that would fuck up this version of me in his mind if
          it were true.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't back down from the stare, but he looked away first.</p>
        <p>Did not utter a word.</p>
        <p><i>He knows something.</i></p>
        <p>"You look like both your names." Dog said.</p>
        <p>"Yeah." Milk agreed.</p>
        <p>"It's pretty," Upper said.</p>
        <p>I took my eyes off Devil and met Upper's gaze with a smile.</p>
        <p>"There's just something—"</p>
        <p>
          Three audible knocks from the driver's side window had us shouting and
          jumping in fright.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand was already on my chest as I snapped my head to see the blond
          standing there, trying to look in.
        </p>
        <p>"Motherfucker," Dog released a breath upon seeing her.</p>
        <p>And so did everyone, collectively.</p>
        <p>
          "Didn't mean to scare! Can you guys—wind down?" her muffled voice
          reached us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil looked at me, the previous suspicion in his eyes long gone.
          Concern was all that lay there now. "Should I?"
        </p>
        <p>I looked back at the blonde, knowing she couldn't see us.</p>
        <p>
          Cracking my knuckles, I sucked in a breath, trying to calm the hard
          thumping in my chest as I nodded. "Yes," I said, putting on my mean
          face. "Wind down."

        <p><b>DEVIL PRESSED</b> a button, and the window rolled down.</p>
        <p>
          My stomach twisted with uncoordinated jealousy. She was even prettier
          up close—every man's perfect woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hi!" she chirped, looking into the mini-van. "Oh, it's a—it's a full
          house." She said, fighting to keep her grin from falling as her gaze
          fell to Devil, and her grin turned a little easier like she was
          genuinely pleased to meet him. "You must be Elia. I see the
          resemblance, the whole hair color and ch-chin, like—yeah," her grin
          turned into an awkward smile as she glanced at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leveled her with a glare, and she quickly averted her eyes from me.
          Intimidated. Yes. Good. I liked that.
        </p>
        <p>
          She cleared her throat. "You guys have been out here for hours now.
          Would you like to come in?" she asked, swallowing. "My Nonna just
          finished making dinner; I think there is enough for everyone—"
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, thank God, I was starving—"</p>
        <p>"Dog," I warned.</p>
        <p>"What?" He whined. "We haven't eaten in hours, I'm dying here."</p>
        <p>"The cemetery isn't far. Remember?" I gritted out,</p>
        <p>Gemma's eyes widened in fear at my statement.</p>
        <p>
          "And you." I pinned her with a stare. "Do you just randomly invite
          strangers into your home?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked. "Uh...well...you're—you're Elio's girlfriend, and he's
          Elio's brother...I mean—when I saw the minivan, I recognized it and
          knew it couldn't be Elio because he was not in Italy. I tried to call
          him, but he wasn't picking up, and then I figured it might be someone
          from—you know? His work? I wanted to call the cops, but the minivan
          was familiar, and I just wanted to make sure."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, you came out of your house—not sure if it was a serial killer
          waiting to kidnap you or hurt you—just to make sure it was okay to
          call the cops?" Devil asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gingerly, she raised her hand to reveal a pepper spray. "I
          have...pepper spray?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked towards the back seat to my friends, with a question in my
          eyes, only getting shrugs in return.
        </p>
        <p>I turned my gaze to her. "You know us."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," her voice shook. "From the cruise, the first time we met at
          the suite, when I—when I knocked...and lied...because I panicked."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, wondering why she was revealing this much.</p>
        <p>
          "I saw you guys around Elio often, and I've always wanted to introduce
          myself. The minute the window came down, and I saw that it was you, I
          realized that well—well—I figured since you're here, you might have
          found out about me? And since you're here without Elio, then maybe you
          have—uh...questions."
        </p>
        <p>"Can we take this inside? Where there's food?" Dog chipped in.</p>
        <p>
          "That would be great!" Gemma nodded, smiling like she wanted to take
          my friends, too, and then she looked at me. "I promise, Elio and I
          have absolutely nothing romantic to do with each other—we're just very
          good friends. Like very good friends, and I really don't know why he's
          not answering his calls, but I am trying—and I will try my best to
          explain anything you want."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good friends?" Upper popped his head so he could get a good look at
          her. "A good friend he has a baby named Sailor with?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh?" Gemma's eyes widened in shock. "Oh no...oh no, no, no, no. Oh
          God, the gift box...that must be it. Uh—Sailor's my cat. The ginger
          one? With Mimi? Elio told me she spent some time in you guys' suite on
          the cruise. I wanted to thank you guys for your hospitality, but Elio
          hadn't introduced me yet. If I could get a hold of the man in
          question, he would explain perfectly because I'm pretty sure I'm
          making a mess of this whole conversation, and that is the last thing I
          want." She took a long breath, and Her smile was now forced,
          uncomfortable, panicked, like she was scared of making matters worse.
        </p>
        <p>I blinked at her. "So...you're not...you're not his baby mama?"</p>
        <p>
          "Jesus Christ, no! I'm dating his friend. Angelo? That's my
          boyfriend."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh." Milk said from the back seat.</p>
        <p>
          Devil looked at me with a blank face, "We should have answered his
          call."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, starting to see things in a different light. "But
          wait—you called him your love."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma sighed. "I call everyone that. I didn't actually mean it like
          he's my actual love. I call literally everyone I see 'my love.' It's
          like a habit I got...I don't know when I started doing it. But I've
          been doing it for as long as I can remember; I even call my bosses, my
          love, and it's just something I do, and I'm sure you didn't need all
          those details."
        </p>
        <p>
          My shoulders dropped as I rubbed my eyes. "Are you fucking shitting
          me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry." She squeaked. "I am a big people person, and—God, Angelo
          told me he hadn't given the box to Elio because he was still
          recovering and didn't want to trigger anything. I didn't know what
          Angelo did with it after I gave him...like, weeks ago. I'm sorry if I
          caused anything. I just—I just wanted to do something nice
          because—well, he doesn't celebrate birthdays, and gift boxes are
          always perfect, especially yellow ones because they're like sunshine,
          and sunshine is always great for moon minds—God, what am I saying."
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed out, slumping back on the car seat as my shoulders relaxed
          in relief.
        </p>
        <p>"It was all a little misunderstanding, I promise." She added.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, the pain in my chest disappearing as I closed my eyes. "I
          still have questions, and I really hope your grandmother made enough
          food."
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          "Ah, yes! I like full house. Many people come to eat my food!" Gemma's
          Nonna said with a grin upon spotting us as we entered the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was normal, welcoming, colorful, and portable. I couldn't picture
          myself living here long term, but I wouldn't deny it was a beautiful
          home. A regular home with ordinary people. A pattern of life I knew
          nothing about.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, I know that smell." Dog brushed past me and straight to where I
          suppose the kitchen was, not before stopping to ask Gemma's Nonna a
          question, to which she smiled at him and responded with a vigorous
          nod.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I hope we aren't imposing." Devil said, "We can leave if that is the
          case."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh no, that's okay. This is okay." Gemma smiled with a nod, sneaking
          a glance at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I'm Milk," Milk spoke up, outstretching her hand to Gemma with
          a broad smile. "Pleasure to officially meet you. I saw you several
          times on the cruise; you're gorgeous."
        </p>
        <p>
          Color filled Gemma's cheek. "Oh—thanks! Coming from you—that's
          yeah—uh, thank you! You're pretty, too! The extraordinary kind,
          very—very pretty."
        </p>
        <p>Milk's smile widened, "Why, thank you!"</p>
        <p>
          "I'm Upper, and I'll go make sure Dog doesn't touch anything in your
          kitchen because he seems to believe all kitchens are his. All
          kitchens."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's totally okay, too!" Gemma said, and studying her body
          language, she was pretty overwhelmed by everything happening right
          now; maybe a little uncomfortable, but a people person and a people
          pleaser would definitely never tell you if they're uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>At least, not her kind.</p>
        <p>
          Poor girl. This world we're in would crush her fragile mind, and I bet
          she had absolutely no idea what Elio really did.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where is the Zahra?" Gemma's Nonna made her way towards us, her eyes
          as blue as Gemma's pinned right on me.
        </p>
        <p>I shifted uncomfortably.</p>
        <p>"Hmmm, you are the fuck friend turn girlfriend."</p>
        <p>"Nonna, come on." Gemma chided, sounding embarrassed.</p>
        <p>
          "Shhh, I must do inspection." She squinted her eyes at me, and then
          both hands came to my face, turning it from left to right.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the corner of my eyes, I caught Devil leaning against the wall,
          eyes filled with amusement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I see..." The woman drawled out, "I see same ears...same
          eyebrows...same eye shape but more in woman form. Hmmm...what
          else...frown for me."
        </p>
        <p>"Why the fuck would I—"</p>
        <p>"Frown now!"</p>
        <p>
          I frowned, not because she asked me to frown, but because this was
          really weird.
        </p>
        <p>The woman smiled. "Perfect. Soulmate."</p>
        <p>"I am so confused," I said.</p>
        <p>
          She took her hand from my face. "My mother always tell me if a woman
          meet her soulmate, her true soulmate. They will have some similar
          thing in look, in manner, and sometime in thinking. That is how I know
          me and Maurice, my dead husband, are not soulmate. That is also how I
          know my Gemma and that Giacomo fool she dated before are not soulmate.
          But you and Elio, soulmate."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to see a big grin on Milk's face. "I read that somewhere
          too!" she said, tilting her head, "And now that I think about it, you
          do look—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You have a beautiful home," I cut Milk off before she made the whole
          situation even more weird than it already was. "It's...it's homely."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. My Gemma work very hard for it. Hope everybody like spice! I
          will check on Turkey now. You pink hair, come set the table. Elia,
          come, let us talk as you help me carve the Turkey."
        </p>
        <p>When I was alone with Gemma, I turned to pin her with a look.</p>
        <p>
          She stood straighter. "Listen, Zahra, I know how this must all seem,
          Elio and me, but I promise that it's nothing like that, and I really
          don't want to cause problems between you both. And honestly, Elio
          really, <i>truly</i> does care so much about you, and I feel like he's
          going to hate me for this situation, and—well, maybe the gift box was
          a bad idea; I just really wanted to do something nice. I'm sorry if it
          seemed otherwise."
        </p>
        <p>"How did you meet him?"</p>
        <p>"Ride. I gave him a ride in my car months ago."</p>
        <p>
          I scanned her from head to toe. "Huh...why didn't he mention you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He told me he was finding the perfect way to. I really wanted to meet
          you, but not in this way. In a normal way."
        </p>
        <p>"Right...and you have no ulterior motives." I studied her.</p>
        <p>
          "I don't think I have enough in me to have ulterior motives." She
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>"You're just friends with him."</p>
        <p>"Just friends, I promise."</p>
        <p>"You don't think he's hot."</p>
        <p>She blinked. "I—I think he's all right and perfect for you."</p>
        <p>"And not for you?"</p>
        <p>
          She swallowed. "I like Angelo. Very much. I promise you, you have
          nothing to worry about regarding my friendship with Elio. I care about
          him as a friend, and that's it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm." I nodded. "He didn't call you to tell you we might be coming?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "When I saw the van, I called him, but he didn't answer; I haven't
          heard from him in like two days, but I always see him around when I
          face time, Angelo."
        </p>
        <p>"Do you usually let people push you over?"</p>
        <p>She blinked. "W—what?"</p>
        <p>"You let people step on you too often?"</p>
        <p>
          She swallowed. "I uh...I don't know what you mean. I really do not
          want to offend anyone and—"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, I don't really care."</p>
        <p>
          I liked that despite our age difference, I was still in control of the
          situation, and that was all I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking around to make sure no one was coming or listening in, I took
          a step towards her, and she inched back a bit. "I'll make one thing
          clear, <i>Gemma</i>. He's mine. And if this friendship thing rubs me
          the wrong way, in any way or form, we will be having a less cordial
          conversation. I love to set boundaries. I don't care if you call
          everyone your love, you don't call him that, and you don't give him
          kisses, you don't do any of that shit."
        </p>
        <p>She nodded. "Got it."</p>
        <p>
          I let my hand settle on her shoulder, and a smile curved on my lips.
          "Good talk." I patted her shoulder, looking around as I stepped away
          from her. "Your choice of wallpaper is perfect. Aesthetic."
        </p>
        <p>Her throat worked. "Thank you."</p>
        <p>
          "Also, you shouldn't easily let people into your home like this...even
          if they're friends of your friend. It's not safe. Not everyone is who
          they say they are or who you think they are."
        </p>
        <p>She nodded. "Yeah, of course."</p>
        <p>I nod once before turning and heading to the kitchen.</p>
        <p>*** </p>
        <p>
          When we left Gemma's after being there for a couple of hours—hours of
          eating and listening to Gran Louisa bad-mouth her late husband
          non-stop, we went back to the compound, worked a little on the map,
          brought out some coordinates, and waited for confirmation, before we
          decided to call it a day and leave the compound.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned my head against the car window; eyes closed as I imagined the
          soft bed waiting for me back at our condo. I was tired, worn out from
          all the emotional and mental distress I'd gone through.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes when I felt Devil make a curve into the house's small
          gate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk was already fast asleep, her head on Dog's shoulder. Upper's eyes
          were closed, but I knew he wasn't sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the house appeared, I sat up straighter, stretching my limbs and
          suppressing a yawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio," Devil said, and I froze as I spotted the figure leaning
          against a car right in front of the house. He raised his head as we
          approached, his gaze following us.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned in confusion. "What the hell is he doing here?"</p>
        <p>
          "Do you want me to stop here? Or should I head to the garage first?"
        </p>
        <p>I took off my seat belt. "Stop here."</p>
        <p>Devil nodded, slowing down and stopping opposite the far end.</p>
        <p>Elio didn't move; he was still leaning on his car, watching us.</p>
        <p>"We'll be inside," Devil said.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded before getting out of the car, and he drove off to the back
          of the small compound toward the garage.
        </p>
        <p>When I looked up at Elio, he was already looking at me.</p>
        <p>
          Face, as usual, expressionless. In his hand was a lighter he was
          flicking open and close, over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew a shaky breath as I walked over to him, watching his eyes
          follow me until I was directly in front of him. He looked stressed but
          well-arranged. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "London was too cold for you?" I asked, wondering why the hell I had
          decided to lead with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't say anything. He just watched me. Like expected. The sound
          of the lighter filling the space between us.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
        <p>
          "Nobody was answering my calls." Flick. "You turned off your phone
          after your...numerous text messages. I could not reach you, Elia, or
          anyone. So, I flew back."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mentally, I punched myself. Somehow, I had forgotten the text messages
          or even my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, why would you come all the way—" I sighed. "Those messages
          weren't—they're no longer valid."
        </p>
        <p>
          The flicking continued, but he wore no expression still. "What does no
          longer valid mean." It wasn't a question.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know everything now about Gemma and your friendship with her. We
          went there—to her house and talked to her and Gran Louisa, and I
          cleared it all up."
        </p>
        <p>"You cleared it up." He stated.</p>
        <p>"Yeah," I answered, trying to read his mood.</p>
        <p>
          He stood upright, the flicking stopped, and he shoved the lighter back
          into his pocket. "I am glad you did. I'll be on my way."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned as he started walking around the car.</p>
        <p>
          Hugging myself from the cold outside, I tried to tame the anger bubble
          rising in me. "So you're mad," I called out, and he stopped, letting
          his shoulder fall, allowing a minute to go by, before turning to me. I
          took in his blank stare. "You think you have the liberty to be mad
          right now? You think you're the victim in this situation."
        </p>
        <p>"I never said anything, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah. You flew all the way from London, only to leave after
          exchanging a few words with me and acting like I was the one who hid
          someone of the opposite gender from you."
        </p>
        <p>"I never made a comment." He said, straight-faced.</p>
        <p>
          I ground my teeth, taking a step closer but leaving enough distance.
          "I had every right to be angry."
        </p>
        <p>"I did not say otherwise."</p>
        <p>"Why are you acting like a fucking asshole right now?"</p>
        <p>"I am?"</p>
        <p>
          I counted to five in my head, ascending and descending. "If you have
          something to say, just say it."
        </p>
        <p>"Now you want to communicate."</p>
        <p>
          I took another step closer. "That's why you're angry? Because I didn't
          answer your call or listen to you? I was thinking the worst—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I collected that from your messages. I reread them multiple times; I
          could even recite them word for word. You <i>indeed</i> thought the
          worst. I understand and am aware of my fault in this. I did not tell
          you about her, not because there was anything to hide.
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason was because I was preparing myself to join two parts of my
          world together. Another was because you already met her at the cruise,
          and if I recall, we were not together then, and I did not tell you I
          knew her because right then, at that moment, I was not in the suitable
          head space to have that conversation with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were other opportunities to tell you; I am aware of that, too. I
          admit I treated the matter with ignorance because I knew it would be
          challenging to make you understand since you had already seen her, and
          I never said anything then. But I was going to take you to Gran Louisa
          because she wanted to meet you. You can ask Angelo; I already
          scheduled a day to do it after we return from the trip. That is if you
          still think I would have never told you about her."
        </p>
        <p>"I already know—"</p>
        <p>
          "About the gift box. I had absolutely no idea it existed. Allow me to
          stress further that if I had wanted to hide it from you, you would
          have never found it."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed. "I know that now."</p>
        <p>
          "I know you know that. I know you would have been angry, and I know
          you had every right to be. But to assume or to believe that I would do
          something as despicable as infidelity?" His expression was quick to
          switch from indifference to hurt. "You know my history with that,
          Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed. "I know—"</p>
        <p>
          "Yet you said those things. You <i>thought</i> those things about me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't mean them—I was just angry. I knew you wouldn't do that to
          me, but I was sad, and I just believed it because it was better to
          believe it than to not believe it and be disappointed and hurt more
          later on if it turned out to be true."
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "You still doubted me after everything. I know I am
          not good with actions; I know my words sometimes are the only things I
          can show you, but I promise you, Zahra, I have <i>never</i> lied to
          you about my feelings for you. I mean every word I say. I don't joke
          with us. I don't fucking joke with you, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was hammering, and I was regretting those text messages,
          recalling how I had told him his words meant nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, he walked closer, taking up the remaining space between us
          as he raised his hand to smooth my hair away from the side of my face.
          "Do I have to spell it out?" he asked quietly as I raised my head,
          allowing our eyes lock. "Hm?" he questioned, tilting his head as his
          knuckles brushed from my chin to my jawline until he was cupping the
          side of my face.
        </p>
        <p>My mouth went dry.</p>
        <p>
          "If the fact that I told you that you were my life and that you mean
          everything to me doesn't make any sense to you, if you want me to say
          how I feel in a layman's language, in a way that doesn't touch the
          depths of what I feel for you, then all right. I love you..." his
          fingers caressed my neck, bright grey eyes searching the browns of
          mine. "I love you, and that is the simplest way I can put it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't speak. I wasn't even sure if I was breathing. But it was
          suddenly difficult to take in oxygen, and to stand, and to do remotely
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elio pressed his body even closer to mine, placed his forehead on
          mine, closed his eyes, and breathed feverishly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Te quiero, Zahra." He said. "Tú tienes mi corazón."<br /><i
            >(I love you, Zahra. You have my heart.)</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The warmth from his body flowed into mine as he moved, leaned further
          in, tilted his head, and pressed his lips to mine. A kiss that had me
          holding on to his shirt, a connection that had my heart mirroring the
          exact rhythm of his. An intoxication that had my stomach going to war
          with itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anger had failed me, agility had betrayed me, and the fight in me was
          no longer in existence. Everything in me was him and this, and I
          kissed him back with as much attention, as much detail, and as much
          fervor. My hand left its hold on his shirt to the side of his face as
          I got on my toes, parting my lips, brushing my tongue with his,
          tasting him, feeling him, wanting him.
        </p>
        <p>He loved me.</p>
        <p><i>Me. </i></p>
        <p>
          My fingers buried themselves in his hair as I tugged, breaking the
          kiss as my eyes searched his. "You love me?"
        </p>
        <p>"I do."</p>
        <p>
          Something swelled in my chest, and I joined my lips with his again—I
          didn't understand why I felt the urge to cry. But I could feel what he
          felt. I knew the love he carried because I carried it, too.
        </p>
        <p>I could feel the pounding of his heart against mine.</p>
        <p>
          I loved that he could tell me. I loved that at least one of us could
          voice it. I loved the way he had expressed it.
        </p>
        <p>I appreciated that he did.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to voice it too; I wanted to tell him—break this kiss and
          tell him how I felt, how light and free he made me feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I couldn't. I couldn't do it. Not now, at least. Doing it meant
          giving away the last piece of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't ready, and with the way he kissed me back, I knew he
          understood. He placed no pressure on me, and I appreciated that as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never bargained for this when I took back my freedom, but one thing
          I knew was that I was never letting go of this feeling. I was never
          letting go of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I would suffice with his confession. He loved me. I had
          someone I could hold, kiss, and talk to—and he loved me.
        </p>
        <p>That was enough reason to drop every guard I had put between us.</p>
        <p>
          Enough to prepare myself to reveal why exactly I had left Sicily. I
          trusted him, and we were already working towards the same goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wouldn't hurt to have him be on my side and in my plans, even if it
          meant finding another way to help Vitale.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might not be wise, it might be foolish, but for once in my life, I
          was taking the risk.
        </p>
        <p>And I knew in my heart that it would be worth it.</p>

      <h1>65. Zahra</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Hi! Thank you for your engagement in the last chapter!</p>
        <p>This is a long one! Hang on!</p>
        <p>
          Let's be generous commenters and voters today! I love hearing your
          thoughts, so don't shy away from the comment section!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we start, let's remember that no human/book character is
          without their flaws, neither are they above mistakes.... also, as some
          of you may know, (Zahra is an unreliable narrator, this is most likely
          why we can be in her head for a whole chapter and still not know what
          she's up to.)
        </p>
        <p>With this said, I hope you....Enjoy..........the update!</p>
        <p>_______</p>
        <p><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p><b>I SAW </b>today before it happened.</p>
        <p>
          I'd seen it for months—hell, I'd seen it for years, and I knew only
          two outcomes from it. One was a disastrous outcome, and another was a
          clean sweep, minimal damage—emotional and physical wise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disaster being a little argument—nothing STREET and I wouldn't be able
          to overcome completely—unless we were utterly unable to overcome
          it...unless I fuck up so bad, I'm unable to tell them before it all
          goes down, or they find out through a less favorable means. Knowing
          us, I was banking on the less favorable means.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took weeks, but we narrowed the coordinates down to three
          locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We stormed the first one, but it was an empty warehouse, a fluke to
          throw us off our game. It did throw us, and we were disappointed, even
          though we had cracked two other coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          In two days, we set out for the second location and encountered three
          other groups looking for the painting—we learned that we were being
          followed and our movements were being monitored. We expected it. Elio
          had clarified at a meeting that though we had the map, we shouldn't be
          as stupid to think people didn't know we had it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He further said it wasn't even a matter of who had it; it was a matter
          of who got it first, who held the most firepower, who was more
          competent.
        </p>
        <p>I knew all this before he raised the awareness.</p>
        <p>
          I knew many things I wasn't privy to say just yet—things I was scared
          to say because the consequences meant losing more than I had bargained
          for, even though I knew there would be a 70% chance that I would lose
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >After all, I hadn't heard back from Sicily after my last
            message.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second location, we found absolutely nothing. Like I suspected
          we would, the third location should be where the gold was, alongside
          those flash drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />I knew about the drives before the painting or the gold. I only
          connected the pieces while working with STREET and Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I had been here to investigate the flash drive's whereabouts,
          I'd also been spying on <b><i>P. Deluxe Corp</i></b
          ><b>.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew the flash drives would have been hidden somewhere and would
          take more than wits to find them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving Sicily at 19, I had one thing in mind. Bring down
          <i>P. Deluxe Corp</i>, the organization behind the pedo-ring—or at
          least, what I knew they were called. From the different transactions,
          placement documents, and payment receipts I had found in Martino's
          record of the time he had been in the Conti Serpent Society, all high
          orders came from this <i>P. Deluxe Corp. </i>
        </p>
        <p>I had done my research about them.</p>
        <p>
          To the public, the cooperation was a private research facility owned
          by a man called Pedro Lombardi, who was now deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale had told me that finding the cooperation was too easy—and
          something was amiss. But I had looked at every directive and Intel
          from spies I had in different places, all pointed at
          <i>P. Deluxe Corp.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          A week ago, Elio had also mentioned their name when he told me of his
          findings. These were things I already knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          We couldn't take up the matter with authorities or make up a case
          against the cooperation being a false research network, but we could
          destroy it. Numerous children are born every day, trafficked for this
          fucked up act. Teenagers and young adults were being sold into sex
          slavery, violated against their will, and drugged up to be taken by
          sick men who sought out their pleasures in little children—girls and
          boys, born into the end of their lives.
        </p>
        <p>It had to stop.</p>
        <p>
          I might have helped Ashlyn save those children, but I couldn't rope
          her into the bigger picture. It wasn't safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Elio, I was going to tell him everything today—I knew he would
          understand why I held back, and I knew he would be by my side because
          if I was frank with myself, I couldn't do it alone. Stopping this
          pedo-ring has been a massive part of my life since I discovered
          myself. Who I was, what I wanted, and what I would die doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted no child or adult to go through what I did. I knew stopping
          this particular ring wouldn't stop pedophilia around the world, but it
          would prevent children from being born into the business and then
          later into sex slavery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or even the fucked-up rumor I heard about some of the donor kids being
          left on the side with a precise job description of reproduction. The
          girls were kept alive for their wombs, and the boys were kept alive
          for their sperm.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a terrible thing, and I hoped it was just rumored, but knowing
          this world I grew up in, there was a huge possibility that it was
          true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale already helped get our people on standby, waiting for my word
          to bring down that cooperation. But I wanted to finish here first, get
          the flash drives to Elio, tell him everything, and hope to God that he
          let me have the flash drive I needed to find the information Vitale's
          people required to proceed in hacking into their systems, finding
          every branch and house, before blowing up the building and bringing
          down those bastards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every single one of the fuckers making these children would die today.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was in my throat. I was nervous because a lot was riding on
          today.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could get it right, I could salvage all the relationships that
          might be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, Devil and I were on our way to the third location, and a
          long convoy of Marino SUVs were behind us. Ready with arms in case any
          other group decided to join the fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog was in one of the SUVs with Marino's people, and Milk and Upper
          were working behind the scenes, as this location required several
          invisible eyes rather than physical bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand was on the gun strap around my waist, my focus dead set on the
          road ahead, and my mind, a chaos of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You good?" Devil's voice reached inside my head from the driver's
          side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked towards him, noting the frown on his brows, but it was one of
          concentration.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, I'm good."</p>
        <p>
          His lips pressed into a thin line, but he didn't speak after that. I
          studied him for a bit, knowing that despite our little jokes here and
          there over the past weeks, we had been tiptoeing around each other. I
          didn't want to broach the topic because the last thing I wanted was to
          be at odds with any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which I had been with Dog for two days after revealing the information
          about the new email stating that the stakes had been higher and we
          were no longer hunting for 50 million pieces of gold; it was now 300
          million. Marino's people had helped provide resources for transporting
          the gold; that is if we found it here—which we were going to.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," I said, calling his attention as he glanced over. I tapped my
          comm, gesturing for him to turn his off.
        </p>
        <p>When he did, his frown deepened. "What's wrong?"</p>
        <p>"I feel like we need to talk."</p>
        <p>His grip on the wheel tightened. "About what?"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't play pretend. Ever since I told everyone my real name, your
          eyes have been on me, and we've been walking on eggshells around each
          other. I'd like to know why."
        </p>
        <p>
          His body tensed up, and I knew he didn't want to talk about it; he
          wanted to play pretend, imagine he hadn't heard or realized anything
          so the little bubble he was in wouldn't burst. He was at war with
          himself, and it only edged my curiosity to know what he knew.
        </p>
        <p>"It's nothing." He said.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "Look, we're about to enter a battleground together; I just
          want to ensure we're good before we face possible death?"
        </p>
        <p>
          After a second of quietness, he let out a breath. "Do you recognize
          the term <i>E2?</i>"
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, recognizing the term, having heard it from Martino
          severally and sometimes The Serpents.
        </p>
        <p>Even <i>I</i> have been in close contact with that name.</p>
        <p>
          E2 was a private, faceless assassin who worked jobs for private bodies
          like The Serpents or any mafia or gang leader who wanted to get a job
          done, clean, and smooth without a bite back up their asses. E2 was the
          best assassin in the underground business. One, they were efficient
          and always got the job done without mistakes; two, nobody knew who
          they were, if it was a he or a she. Three, because you cannot find a
          killer that doesn't exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          E2 came at a very high price, meaning you would have to be ready to
          pay for them to get the job done. Sometimes, the pay wasn't money; it
          was information. Valuable information that made it difficult for E2 to
          be targeted.
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah. How do you know of E2." I asked him with a frown.</p>
        <p>
          He glanced at me, his eyes, the void they had always been in when I
          knew nothing about him but his ability to never move any muscle on his
          face. He looked back to the road.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know of him. I am him."</p>
        <p>
          The silence that befell us was very heavy. At first, I heard his voice
          repeat in my head as I tried to make sense of the revelation. "I don't
          understand."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is nothing to understand. There's just the truth. I know who
          you are. We communicated prior to me finding you near that fucking
          trash can, shivering and looking like you hadn't had anything to eat
          in days."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away from him. "I <i>hadn't</i> had anything to eat in days."
          I clarified. "I can't believe you're E2. How come this never came to
          anyone's notice?"
        </p>
        <p>"You're one to talk." He glanced at me with a stern glare.</p>
        <p>
          "When I said my name, and you realized who I was, why didn't you react
          then?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was also at risk of revealing who <i>I</i> was. I am also not one
          to meddle in shit that doesn't concern me, and I stopped being E2 when
          STREET was created."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, my chest growing heavy. "So, you let me hang around your
          brother for the past weeks, knowing who I was and what I'm capable
          of."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You promised not to hurt him, and I believed and trusted you. Even
          after knowing your last name and who you were."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes turned from him and back to the road. "Well, you're right. I
          have no intention to hurt him. He means more than you know to me."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm guessing he doesn't know." His voice was stern.</p>
        <p>"I plan to tell him," I stated.</p>
        <p>From my periphery, I knew he was shaking his head.</p>
        <p>
          It was quiet for a short while until he broke it. "Was everything with
          STREET staged?"
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed. Hard.</p>
        <p>
          I squared my shoulders, keeping my gaze trained ahead. "We're almost
          nearing the location; we should turn on our comms—"
        </p>
        <p>"Was everything staged, Zahra?"</p>
        <p>
          I turned to look at him. "I love STREET, okay? I love each and every
          one of you. You guys are like the family I never got to have, and
          while it never started like that, it doesn't mean that everything
          we've been through together doesn't mean shit to me."
        </p>
        <p>"Will you tell them?'</p>
        <p>
          My heart and nervousness went a bit wild. "I will. When I get
          everything I want."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another tense silence passed, and he broke it again. "You were my last
          job."
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You. I was paid to kill Zahra Faizan. I only got your name, which I
          recognized from when you were my client. I didn't take the job or any
          other information about you. Shortly after, I found you, and you made
          STREET. I left E2 behind and became Devil."
        </p>
        <p>"Who sent you to kill me?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Ignazio Conti."</p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes, "Of course." I muttered. "What other way to get in
          the seat than to kill me off so Vitale wouldn't have standing? He's
          going to be a problem."
        </p>
        <p>"You're a problem," Devil muttered under his breath.</p>
        <p>
          I faced the road, clenching my jaw. "Only to those who are a problem
          to me," I responded. "Turn on your comm; we have work to do."
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          We pulled over at a lone dirt road, and I looked left and right,
          seeing nothing out for miles, just dried untrimmed weed, sand, and a
          withering farmland by the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          We got out of the car, and Dog walked towards us from the car he had
          been in. He looked around, eyes taking in our surroundings. "You sure
          we're at the right place?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Yes,"</i> Upper said in our ears.
          <i>"You're standing where the coordinate led." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Maybe we need to be looking for something unusual." </i>Milk
          offered.
          <i
            >"We might not see what we're supposed to see because the whole area
            is disguised to look like nothing but a dirt road."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah..." my eyes zeroed in on a lone, healthy apple tree a few meters
          from the woods at the far end of the side of the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking to either side of me, I saw Dog and Devil staring at the tree,
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have a very crude Adam and Eve joke that would be so inappropriate
          to say right now." Dog said.
        </p>
        <p>"Keep it to yourself," Devil said, surveying the area.</p>
        <p>
          "Admit you're dying to hear it. You're legit shaking in your boots to
          hear it."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not wearing boots."</p>
        <p>I stepped forward, "We should—"</p>
        <p>
          The raving of multiple engines halted my statement as I spotted
          numerous cars driving towards us from afar with blinding speed;
          Marino's men were quick to get into position.
        </p>
        <p>
          A biker group was arriving from our left side, the roar of engines
          filling the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit." Dog said, pulling out his gun at the same time I pulled mine
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mr. Marino," one of the soldiers rushed towards Devil with a phone
          outstretched. "The boss wants to speak to you."
        </p>
        <p>Devil collected the phone as a set of soldiers came around us.</p>
        <p>
          I rechecked my gun while surveying our area, watching our right as the
          cars neared.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have to move," I said, not listening to what Devil was saying to
          Elio on the phone as we started rushing towards the tree, almost the
          same time the people on the motorcycles opened fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were well covered against the shooting happening around us, but I
          could feel a strange kind of heat that rocked the severity of our
          situation right straight to my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, he wants to talk to you," Devil said, handing the phone over to
          me as he got his gun out on the ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collecting the phone, I pressed it against my ear, turning off the
          comm while letting my gaze settle on the woods and bushes behind the
          tree, spotting movements. "Now's not a great time, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I am aware. I can practically hear it."</i> He spoke.

          He sounded so calm, like me and his brother weren't currently being
          shot at or surrounded by people who wanted what we were going for.
        </p>
        <p>"How do you know they're in different locations?"</p>
        <p>It was quiet for a second too long before he responded.</p>

          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Really loving this pep talk, right now of all times," I said as we
          reached the tree, and I spotted the installed lock system while Devil
          and Dog hurriedly communicated with Upper and Milk to get it open.
          "How does it feel sitting peacefully in an expensive hotel room while
          your girlfriend is one bullet away from being killed?"

        <p>
          My heart was thumping so loud as I joined the men in covering Dog and
          Devil, one hand holding firm on the gun as I fished for targets,
          getting too close to where we stood. My other hand was holding firmly
          onto the phone.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Zahra,"</i> Elio called.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm here," I said, my gaze shifting slightly to the woods again,

        <p>
          I paused, dropping my brows down in a frown. "Why do you need me to

          I nodded, even knowing he couldn't see me. "Of course, I'll get the

          something important I have to tell you afterward."

        </p>
        <p>"Rich people."</p>
        <p>
          The ground rumbled beneath my feet, and I stepped back simultaneously
          with Devil, Dog, and the other men around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          A large round portion of the ground was rotating, going downwards as
          it did, like a huge drill paving a safe passage for us. It revealed
          sets of metal stairs as it continued going down. The walls on the
          circular ground were also metal.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Found the passage?"</i></p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>
          He gave a 'hm' of approval.
          <i>"Be careful, Zahra. I expect you unharmed." </i>
        </p>
        <p>"You will get me unharmed."</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Hm."</i> It was quiet as some of the men went in first.
          <i>"Zahra?"</i>
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah?"</p>
        <p><i>"Te amo." </i></p>
        <p>
          My heart missed a beat, and all the air rushed out of my lungs on cue.
          He didn't say it often, but when he did, the effect was long-lasting.
          I blew out an unleveled breath and spoke quietly. "I'll see you soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          The line disconnected, and I returned the phone to one of the men by
          my side, looking towards the woods again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What in the stranger things," Dog whistled as he followed behind some
          soldiers down to the open ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was about to follow suit when Devil held my arm back as he turned
          off his comm. "Elio said you are getting the drives."
        </p>
        <p>My eyes looked between his. "Yeah."</p>
        <p>"He trusts you." he pointed out.</p>
        <p>"I know. That's why I'm going to get the drives to him."</p>
        <p>His eyes shined with suspicion.</p>
        <p>
          I let out a sharp breath. "Come on, Devil, you've known me for almost
          six years. When I say you can trust me, I mean it. I will get the
          drives to him and tell him everything, and if I can convince him to
          let me look at one of the drives, we'll be saving many lives. Please
          trust me on this."
        </p>
        <p>He stared at me for a bit longer. "Okay."</p>
        <p>I let out a breath, about to leave, but he held me back.</p>
        <p>"Don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it."</p>
        <p>"I won't."</p>
        <p>
          A nod from him and a confirmation from me, he let go of my arm as we
          climbed down the metal stairs and into the ground together.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The lights above us were censored lights; they only turned brighter
          when we were beneath them, and as we walked through the straight
          hallway, I created a brick wall over my mind, reminding myself why I
          was there. I didn't bargain for a full-blown quest, but I admitted we
          had come a long way—I have come a long way, and finally, I was going
          to do all I had set out to do from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could still hear the shouts, echoes, gunshots, and thuds from upside
          the ground. It was chaos out there, and if more arms and men didn't
          come to support the ones outside, we might as well prepare for the
          chaos that would be transferred here.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I hate underground." Dog's voice echoed. "I've never been
          underground, but I hate it."
        </p>
        <p>"We've lost connection to Upper and Milk," Devil said.</p>
        <p>"Upper did say it might happen," I said, looking around.</p>
        <p>
          Our footsteps echoed on the metal ground, the smell of gas, fuel, and
          metal filled the area, and I allowed myself the liberty of letting out
          a breath. The device in one of the soldier's hands started beeping as
          we reached an intersection. There were two hallways—one on the left
          and another on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The device is picking up the location of the gold from the right."
          The soldier said.
        </p>
        <p>"That means the flash drives are on the left side," I said.</p>
        <p>
          Devil looked towards me with a nod. "Two soldiers will accompany you,
          just in case."
        </p>
        <p>"Sure, I'll grab the drives and meet you guys back there."</p>
        <p>"Be careful," Dog said, and I nodded.</p>
        <p>"You too,"</p>
        <p>
          "Call for the extraction team," Devil said to one of the soldiers as
          he and Dog headed down the right, and I made my way towards the left
          side with two soldiers following me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned around another corner and didn't have to look too much to
          find the black box attached to the wall, alongside a small patch of
          alphabetical keys and a small screen.
        </p>
        <p>I looked back at both men who escorted me. "What time is it?"</p>
        <p>
          One of them dropped his brow in confusion as he checked his watch.
        </p>
        <p>"Twenty-nine minutes past three."</p>
        <p>I turned off my comm.</p>
        <p>
          In about a minute, I would be certain my order had reached my people
          on time because I shouldn't have spotted them in the woods.
        </p>
        <p>They shouldn't be here.</p>
        <p>
          The moment I turned back to the box, a loud explosion rocked and
          vibrated around the walls, sending cracks above the metallic build of
          the ceiling as sprinkles of sand fell from above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the building, gunshots rang so loud, echoing around the space,
          alongside yells from men and the thuds of bodies dropping.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck," I cursed under my breath as I quickly pulled out my gun,
          removed it from the safety, and turned, "I'm sorry guys," Their eyes
          widened with realization as I pulled the trigger before either of them
          could reach for their weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shot one in the neck and the other straight to the chest, their
          bodies dropping as I turned to the box and typed out the password with
          shaking fingers—jumping slightly when another explosion rocked the
          building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Footsteps rushed in my direction as I pressed enter after typing the
          password.
        </p>
        <p>
          A soft click sound resounded from the box, and I rushed to turn it
          open.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were six flash drive casings; only five were occupied, but the
          sixth was empty.
        </p>
        <p><i>Someone had been here before me. </i></p>
        <p>
          I quickly took all five casings, checking the names carved on them.
          Four of those names were familiar; one wasn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ma'am," I turned towards the voice as the footsteps halted, and a
          rumble shook the ground again.
        </p>
        <p>
          My frown turned into a glare as I stared at the man who had spoken.
          "Nobody got my orders? I specifically asked everyone to stand back
          until they heard from me!" I seethed out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mr. Conti overruled it," the man said, handing me a phone. "He's on
          the line."
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at the phone before collecting and pressing it to my ear.
          "You better have a good fucking explanation as to why you just ruined
          my whole plan, Vitale."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Is the cooperation shifting base a good explanation for you?</i>"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Ma'am, we have to leave now." The guard said as the crack above us
          expanded. "This whole place is about to come down."

        <p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p>
        <p>
          "I'll have them call you back when I get to safety." I ended the call.
          "Let's go," I said, brushing past them as my mind tried to push in the
          fact that I was ignoring the missing drive, knowing exactly whose name
          was written on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was smoke everywhere as we rushed through the direction I had
          come through. The men were all around me, protecting me from everyone
          running around with stacks of gold; even as the building was on the
          verge of collapsing, I couldn't spot Devil anywhere, but as I rounded
          a corner, I spotted Dog on the ground, fighting off another man who
          was trying to direct a gun right to his head—his head which had a gash
          that had almost half of his face covered in blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to rush towards him on instinct, but the men around me
          stopped my movement. The small shift had Dog's head turning a little,
          his gaze locking with mine as I was being ushered out; his stare
          dropped to the flash drives in my hands and then back to me before his
          brows drew down in confusion and realization.
        </p>
        <p>
          His opponent took that little opportunity to slam the gun right at the
          side of his head, knocking him out as another explosion rocked the
          building, and a loud crumble reached my ear.
        </p>
        <p>"We need to leave!"</p>
        <p>
          Looking back at Dog's unconscious figure one last time, I turned away
          and left the chaos behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          A convoy was already awaiting us as we made it out of the ground, and
          I was ushered into a car. My heart was pounding; my eyes burned as the
          vehicle moved hastily. It was a disaster. I fucked up. I fucked up
          even though it hadn't been my intention; it still didn't erase the
          fact that I left them behind when I could have helped. I chose my
          mission and my goal over my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          A decision I couldn't take back, a decision I would never be able to
          take back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prayed to God that Devil had survived and got to Dog on time before
          the whole place collapsed in on itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Give me a phone," I said, and a device was passed to me. I typed in
          Elio's phone number and put out a call to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My chest grew tight when the first ringing came through; I waited and
          waited and waited until the line cut. I called again, anxiety grazing
          every string of nerves in my body.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't answer.</p>
        <p>
          I tried three more times, and on the last try, my vision blurred, and
          I gave up. My hands shook, and I bit my bottom lip hard to stop the
          tears threatening to let themselves out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't shake the feeling in my gut telling me how big a mistake I
          had made, but I hardened my mind, set my jaw, blinked away the tears,
          and held on.

        <p>
          It took 2 hours, but we got to a safe base, and I was handed a laptop
          after placing a call to Vitale.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You better be right about this MCSS. Because I swear to God, Vitale,
          you'll pay dearly if anything happens to my friends."
        </p>
        <p>
          I could almost see him rolling his eyes.
          <i
            >"We don't have time for your melodrama, Zahra; everything you have
            worked your ass off for is on the line, one information away from

            your friends with weird names."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I ground my teeth together. "Just letting you know," I said as I
          inserted the USB drive into the laptop. Nerves wrecked my body as I
          clicked open the small icon displayed on the screen and stopped short.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Marino caporegime sovereign society?" I read aloud, my heart beating
          so fast against my chest.

        <p><i>"He's there after all; what are they about?"</i></p>
        <p>Names of different countries are titled in different folders.</p>
        <p>
          "Hold on." I said, clicking on one of the folders titled 'Italy.' Tons
          of documents were displayed on the screen, dating back years before I
          was born. "Hold on..." I trailed off, squinting as I opened one of the
          documents dated a few years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart stopped, something shifted, my mind drew a blank line, and I
          wasn't breathing.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Zahra?"</i></p>
        <p>
          Shipping details...bank transactions...names and number of children,
          date of births, place of births, trafficking receipts, details of
          newborn needed—the when and the where—details of women and men
          designated to houses around cities and states in Italy. Different
          headquarters in disguise like P. Deluxe Corp.
        </p>
        <p>Everything...everything...</p>
        <p>
          I opened and closed so many documents, my eyes burning and reading
          through words that breezed past my head, words that hurt to read...my
          vision was blurry, my cheeks were wet, my hands were shaking, and my
          breathing was loud.

        <p><i>"Zahra, talk to me what's happening?" </i></p>
        <p>
          Everything, every authorization, the largest funds collected from the
          disgusting details right in front of me, every fucking line and link
          of the whole damn operation, went back to one person. One name.
        </p>
        <p>Elio Marino.</p>
        <p>
          Even to the year I was born, the year I was trafficked down to the
          pedo-house and the sex slavery base, his signature gave the final
          authorization.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt faint in the head. I wanted to faint and die and scream and ask
          why!

        <p>
          "The MCSS. It's them. They run the pedo-ring and so much more. P.
          Deluxe is a tiny portion of how large they are. This whole thing is
          bigger than us, Vitale. And it says here that Elio authorizes
          everything, but I promise you he doesn't know about this. He can't
          know about this."
        </p>
        <p><i>"What?" </i>He sounded as shocked as I was.</p>

        <p>"But it's not—"</p>
        <p>
          "Open your eyes, Zahra. Would he really tell you about something so

          about Elio Marino?"

        <p>
          I couldn't respond to that. My chest drew tight, and I felt so
          betrayed that I wanted to pull my walls down and shoot everyone trying
          to get in.

        <p>
          "There's no acting now." my voice was hard, as I straightened, wiping
          forcefully at my cheeks. "This is big, Vitale. It's more than we
          prepared for."

        <p>
          I tried to level my breathing as I exited from all the documents,
          finding the one regarding P. Deluxe and sending the details to Vitale.
          "I sent you all you need. Bring it down."
        </p>
        <p><i>"And you?" </i></p>
        <p>"I have to handle STREET. I'll call you." I ended the call.</p>
        <p>
          I had deviated, forgotten how ruthless these people can be, forgotten
          what made Elio who he was. I had forgotten that he was a liar, just
          like me, and he was skilled at it, perfect—if not perfect than I was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after registering all this, I still needed to hear him say it. I
          needed his confirmation of his deceit, of his lies. I needed a reason
          to kill this feeling of betrayal and replace it with the hate I so
          badly wanted to feel but couldn't.
        </p>
        <p>But more than anything, I wanted to be wrong.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          It was nighttime, but I reached the location I had traced STREET to. I
          had spent hours getting information about what happened after I had
          left. Not all the gold had been removed, but about two containers had
          left with Marino's people before the place collapsed, leaving many
          dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had no information about who was hurt and who was not, but I knew
          STREET were in a hospital in the city we were in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking into the building, I spotted some of Marino's men around the
          area; they watched me but didn't stop me. Something about the air
          around me told me I wasn't welcome here.
        </p>
        <p>I knew that, too, and that was why I wouldn't be here for long.</p>
        <p>The receptionist directed me toward the room they were in.</p>
        <p>
          I was nervous and a little scared. I carried a heavy heart as I
          stepped out of the elevator, walked towards the room, and stopped in
          front of the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn't exactly what I had planned. But it was nobody else's fault
          but mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed, hoping it would calm the tightness in my chest. When it
          didn't, I pushed the door open and walked in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their talking halted, and my gaze zeroed in on Dog, who was on the
          bed, sitting up—alive—he was all right, even with the bandage around
          his head and a broken arm. He was okay, and he was alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, when I released a breath, it freed some of the tightness in
          my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk stood beside Dog on the bed, Upper was on the seat at the other
          side of the bed, and Devil was by the window; all eyes were on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You sure have the fucking nerve coming back here and showing your
          fucking face." Dog said, and the hate in his eyes was new, something I
          never thought would be directed at me, from him.
        </p>
        <p>The look strangled and squeezed my heart in a brutal vice.</p>
        <p>
          Upper looked away from me like he couldn't bear to look at me for a
          second longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk? There was nothing there? There was nothing in her gaze; she just
          looked at me like she was looking at a stranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil—with the way he looked at me—was disappointed and on the fence
          about everything.
        </p>
        <p>"Get the fuck out." Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "I will. I just wanted to—" I let out a small breath. "I'm sorry, I
          know I fucked up—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You more than fucked up. Crossed past the line of fucked up, and we
          don't wanna hear it." Dog said, "Get the fuck out."
        </p>
        <p>"At least, hear me out, I'm sorry—"</p>
        <p>
          "We don't even know who you are," Milk spoke, "You had a whole fucking
          Convoy to usher you out. Did you forget we had eyes outside that
          area?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you left them there to die," Upper said. "You betrayed us, and
          you betrayed Marino. I don't think a simple, I'm sorry will be able to
          fix anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I didn't leave because I wanted to save only myself. I left for a
            good course.</i
          >
          I could tell them that, but I was done being selfish—I brought them
          together, and now I had to let them go. I had to become one of their
          bad memories because I didn't deserve to leave this unscathed.
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't eat my cake and have it. They deserved better.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not here to fix anything," I said, and Devil frowned. "Honestly,"
          I scoffed out a laugh. "I don't fucking care about any of this shit
          you guys are trying to throw at me. I know I left, and I betrayed you
          guys. I know where I'm at fault, and I'm fucking owning it and
          apologizing for it, and if you guys can't take my apology, then so
          fucking be it."
        </p>
        <p>"This motherfucker." Dog gritted under his breath.</p>
        <p>
          "Zahra, whatever you're trying to do, this is most definitely not the
          best way to do it," Devil said with a glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't care," I said, squaring my shoulders. "STREET was fun, and
          this was nice. But I created it, and now I'm uncreating it. There's so
          much going on that you fuckers don't know about, and shit just got
          very fucking real for me, and everything I've worked so damn hard for
          is on the line right now because I choose this path." I let out a
          shaky breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let me guess," Milk started, "We were a means to an end for you,
          weren't we? A small equation to whatever grand scheme you're a part
          of."
        </p>
        <p>
          "If that's what you wanna hear, then yes. I specifically picked each
          and every single one of you because there was a lot to benefit for my
          whole personal fucking selfish gain. All skilled people, alone,
          looking for a home, looking for friends, ambition, riches, fucking
          purpose. I gave you all that shit, and now in a way, I've also given
          you gold. I'm the bad guy, ta-fucking-da."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Get out," Devil said; the anger in his eyes held firm. It was
          promising. But the promise wasn't anything good. "Seriously, fucking
          leave."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was leaving anyway," I said, my heart squeezing even more. "Upper
          was leaving too...I thought I should mention."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper's head snapped up, eyes finding mine, wide with apprehension.
          "What the bloody hell, Zahra!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What? You weren't going to tell them?" I laughed, but it was
          humorless. "This was a fucking sinking ship, we all wanted different
          things."
        </p>
        <p>"You're leaving?" Devil directed the question to Upper.</p>
        <p>"No, it's not—I didn't make the—"</p>
        <p>
          "Also, Devil knew who I was for weeks and didn't tell any of you. I'm
          not the only one who isn't loyal and capable of betraying all of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the hell is wrong with you, Zahra." Milk asked, looking at me
          with disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh please, don't pretend to be all fucking innocent now. You've never

          actual value in STREET. What was it you said on the cruise? How you
          wanted to be normal, and have a normal life? New flash, Milk, you
          can't be around us and have a normal life, and you know that, and
          somewhere deep fucking down, you're looking for a way to leave. Am I
          wrong?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't speak, and the tears in her eyes told me I had broken
          something between us that could never be repaired.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around us and almost broke into tears then and there. I
          couldn't see any of them clearly due to the tears filling my eyes.
          "You've all got the gold; you've all got a second chance to be who you
          want, to take revenge on life and experience all the things you've
          missed out on because of your fucked up parents. So you each take the
          gold and get the fuck out of Italy and these fucking Streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forget about me. I'm nothing; I ruined us; I'm one bad dream, another
          black ink in your past because, truth be told, if I could turn back
          time to when we were underground, I would choose myself over each and
          every single one of you. Over and over again. That's who I am. That's
          Zahra Faizan."
        </p>
        <p>"I bet you're proud of it." Dog seethed.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh yes, I'm very fucking proud," I said. "I started this whole thing.
          Not because I wanted a family or friends. I had a job to do; I needed
          the perfect pretense game, and STREET was created. I succeeded. I got
          what I wanted, and now I don't really need any of you anymore.
        </p>
        <p>"You are fucking disgusting." Milk said.</p>
        <p>"You're not the first one to tell me that; get in line, Pen."</p>
        <p>
          "You carry on like this," Dog said, "And your ego will be the very
          fucking thing to kill you, mark my words."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, pausing a second before I spoke. "Yeah, already marked,"
          I said. "Like Milk said, STREET was a means to an end for me, and this
          is that end. Hope you all have good fucking lives."
        </p>
        <p>
          I said, maintaining a stoic look as I turned and stepped out of the
          room. The mask I had put on my face fell immediately. I covered my
          mouth with my hand as tears fell freely from my eyes while I rushed to
          the elevator, tapping it repeatedly until it opened. I stepped in,
          collapsing on the wall as I slipped down when the doors closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sobs left me. I didn't shield them because my heart was breaking, and
          I was letting it break because I didn't want this—I didn't want this
          at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was cursed, and I spent the past six years escaping that curse,
          but now it had caught up with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could never be happy—neither could I have anything good. I wasn't
          born to escape a miserable life; I was born into it, and I would die
          being miserable. That was every curse attached to every donor child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cursed to be lonely, never to be loved, only to be used and
          controlled. I had found a way to eradicate being used and controlled,
          but the loneliness would forever remain, and I allowed myself to
          dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, not anymore—now was the time to ensure no child was born with
          that curse anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now was the time to destroy the MCSS; I couldn't be weak. Not now,
          when I was at the start of another race.
        </p>
        <p>I just had one more stop before I took off on the run.</p>
        <p>
          I pulled out my phone from my pocket, calling Vitale. He picked up on
          the first ring.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Zahra,"</i></p>
        <p>"I took care of STREET."</p>
        <p>It was quiet until he asked softly, <i>"Are you okay?"</i></p>
        <p>
          "No." I sniffed. "Spread the word, get everything in order, and tell
          everyone," I wiped my tears. "Tell every motherfucker that I'm coming
          back to my city."

        <p><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>LOYALTY WAS </b>a word I liked to think resonated with who I was as
          a person—at least—most times, in certain situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          An outsider looking in might be the first to think otherwise because
          not everyone knew who I was, but everyone made assumptions based on
          what they saw and heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I might be a liar. I might say one thing and then do the
          opposite, but if I made a promise or an affirmation to someone I cared
          about, I was bound to follow through. I was constrained to honor it in
          a form best suited for the situation, no matter how adverse it might
          be for the person or how much they despised my methods of keeping a
          promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, I knew not everyone was built this way, and I completely
          understood that. I understood many things I should probably question,
          but my heart, mind, and being had pushed my head into withholding my
          suspicions and keeping my conclusions until I heard from her.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Until I heard from Zahra</i>—I raised the flash drive I had been
          holding on to for a day and a few hours—<i
            >Until she told me why exactly her name was imprinted on this
            drive.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Why she had left the underground with the flash drives, accompanied by
          people she had never once mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>Why she had left behind her friends and not once, looked back.</p>
        <p>
          I knew she would be here; I counted the hours, the minutes, and the
          seconds. I was ignoring the doubts tearing through my insides, little
          by little, knowing she would come back to me, and even if she didn't
          return for me, she would return for this drive and whatever content
          they held. After all, that might have been the reason why she was here
          in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I knew she had another motive aside from finding the gold with
          STREET like she had claimed, I never once asked because I saw past
          whatever she was concocting.
        </p>
        <p>I saw her.</p>
        <p>I fell in love with her.</p>
        <p>
          I cared for her and ignored whatever deceit came with her because I
          knew she would feel completely comfortable telling me whatever she had
          been keeping to herself in due time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then again, I could have juggled every scenario of possible things
          she would have wanted out of coming here and doing things under my
          protection, but the last thing I expected was this.
        </p>
        <p>A flash drive dedicated to her.</p>
        <p>I didn't check it.</p>
        <p>
          The last thing I would do was learn something about the woman I loved
          through a device made by someone who could speak the truth and still
          not be as in-depth as it would be coming from her directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I drank from the whiskey glass, dropping it on the table as my eyes
          returned to the drive.
        </p>
        <p><b>'ZAHRA FAIZAN'</b></p>
        <p>
          The first time I saw the drive in that box after reaching the
          underground a day ago, I had completely ignored the drive about the
          MCSS and the one about the Serpent Society. I picked and left with the
          one I had never expected or predicted would be there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't determine the future, and I had no idea how their mission
          would have gone today, but I couldn't risk her flash drive entering
          into the wrong hands, so I took it and left the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro had tried to convince me to check it and to grab the one about
          the MCSS. But I didn't care for those. They could fall into the
          enemy's hands—it would most likely be doing me a favor. I didn't care
          about their affairs, seeing as they were sovereign—but I hadn't found
          a flash drive with my name on it, nor had I found one with my father's
          or my empire's names. I found one with <i>her</i> name, and I needed
          answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking her to be the one to get the drives wasn't a test per se—she
          was supposed to piece two and two together when I gave her the
          password and told her the flash drives would be in a separate space
          from the gold, and upon seeing her flash drive missing, I expected her
          to know who was responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the only one who knew the password, and if the safe had been
          hacked prior, she would not have needed a password to get to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not know what she was hiding, but I knew I had already forgiven
          her—that is, if it had anything directly to do with me. I wanted
          answers because I had failed to predict her actions; I was beyond
          positive Zahra would return to me with the flash drives.
        </p>
        <p>But she hadn't.</p>
        <p>
          I needed to know what had gone wrong, if it was pertaining to whatever
          she wanted to discuss with me, and why she had chosen to do something
          so drastic, knowing she could lose her friends' trust and possibly
          mine. What could have—
        </p>
        <p>
          Gunshots resounded suddenly from outside my hotel room, and my
          thoughts halted as I listened in—muffled thuds, grunts, and combat
          that was too smooth and fast, enough to be missed if one didn't pay
          attention to the rise and fall of the sounds the atmosphere around
          them provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, it stopped, and the silent sound of a door opening and
          closing reached my ears. I stilled but didn't turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand fisted around the flash drive in a vice grip, listening to the
          careful footsteps walking further into the bedroom—searching for me—a
          whiff of her perfume hit my nostrils, and I closed my eyes as her
          footsteps drew nearer, entering the small office-like space the hotel
          suite provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          The footsteps stopped, and then what followed was the click of a gun
          leaving it's safety lock.
        </p>
        <p>I smiled.</p>
        <p>
          "Turn around and get on your knees." Her scratchy voice, on edge,
          thick with emotions, had my jaw locking.
        </p>
        <p>"Are we role-playing?"</p>
        <p>"Do I sound like I'm fucking around?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hard to tell," I spoke into the silence, listening to her unsteady
          breathing as I opened my eyes. "You do not sound quite like yourself
          at the moment."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't see her, but I knew she probably just shifted on her feet.
          I knew her heart was pounding—from the way she spoke and sounded, I
          knew she was hurt, but not physically—and from the way she talked, I
          knew something else had happened.
        </p>
        <p>"Turn around." She said.</p>
        <p>
          Allowing another minute, I flexed the corded muscles around my neck
          and tentatively turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were filled with...anger, swollen with tears she had probably
          cried before coming here, and I watched how fresh tears welled in her
          eyes as she looked down at my hand, which held the flash drive. "Get
          on your knees and hand over the drive." Her voice shook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concern tugged at a muscle in my chest, and I stepped closer. "What's
          wrong, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands tightened on the gun, index finger deadly close to the
          trigger. "Don't come any closer."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, taking another step, and she shifted on her feet, eyeing me
          carefully like she was genuinely scared of my next move. "I'm warning
          you, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is this how you want to do this? Choose violence over cordiality?"
          her throat worked, and a tear slipped down her cheek. "What's wrong,
          querida?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She sniffed, her hands flexing around the weapon's hilt as she set her
          shoulders. "I'm counting in my head. If you don't do as I say, I'll
          shoot you."
        </p>
        <p>"What happened?"</p>
        <p>
          The anger flared in her eyes, and they hardened to slits. "Get on your
          fucking knees Elio, don't make me repeat myself."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't tell if she was actually going to do it, but there was a
          possibility that she would shoot me if I didn't comply, seeing as she
          was <i>apparently</i> too angry to see reason, and I was confused as
          to why this was happening. It couldn't exactly be from the fact that I
          hadn't told her I had been to the underground before her or her team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had disarmed the building and dealt with unnoticeable traps that
          could lead to instant death for trespassers. I had been my usual self,
          always ten steps ahead...just like I did with the first two
          locations. 
        </p>
        <p>"Down, now!"</p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "All right, relax," I said, eying her and the gun before
          raising my hand a little to show her I meant no harm, neither did I
          intend to cause her harm, as I got on my knees before her. "You have
          me where you want me; now, can you please tell me what happened today
          and why you're crying?"
        </p>
        <p>
          As if just noticing the tears on her cheek, she rushed to wipe them
          off, still pointing the gun at me.
        </p>
        <p>"Querida—" </p>
        <p>
          "Don't call me that." she said without missing a beat, "Give me the
          flash drive."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will not," I told her, not letting my eyes fall from hers. "Not
          until you tell me what had gone wrong today."
        </p>
        <p>
          She scoffed; her red-rimmed eyes, filled with tears, pierced me with
          the most cutting glare she had ever dished out to me. My thoughts
          faltered for a second, wondering why she would look at me like that.
          "I found your flash drive." She said, her chest rising and falling a
          little unsteadily. "That's what went wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
          I lifted a brow in question. "That is impossible. I do not have one
          dedicated to me."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, but you do. The MCSS. Ring any bells?"</p>
        <p>My brows shot up. "Oh, them."</p>
        <p>
          Her expression twisted from anger to hate, a snare coating her words
          as she spoke. "How did it feel, Elio? Listening to me talk about being
          violated by men old enough to father me? How did it feel when I cried
          and you offered false comfort? How did it feel to make promises to me,
          telling me you would find the people responsible for the pedo-ring
          when you are the direct channel to where they originate from?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused, watching her with my frown deepening as her words settled in
          my head. "That is a very heavy accusation to throw at me, Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Accusation?" she asked indignantly. "Accusation? You can still kneel
          here and lie to my fucking face in pretense?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, unsure of what she was talking about. "I promise you; this
          isn't me in pretense; this is me watching you accuse me of something
          so diabolical after everything we've been through together."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I saw it." she gritted out. "Your name, your fucking signature, Elio,
          on every file, every document for the MCSS, regarding shipping of
          children, illegal births, pedo-rings varying from countries, every
          authorization came from you, you want to tell me you don't know what
          I'm talking about?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind was working miles per second. I was confused beyond
          comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>The MCSS...</p>
        <p>Pedo-rings...</p>
        <p>Illegal births...</p>
        <p>My authorization....</p>
        <p>
          "Fine, I'll show you," she said, digging her free hand into the
          leather jacket she wore over a white tank top as she pulled out some
          papers. "This was from the year I was born. Check it." she flung the
          papers at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watching her for a few seconds, I gingerly picked up the papers,
          looking through them.
        </p>
        <p><i>What in the world...</i></p>
        <p>
          My mind started drawing a blank, and my thoughts stuttered a bit as my
          eyes went on, word after word. My signature was there, my name was
          there, on the page, with the MCSS dealings...
        </p>
        <p>
          "Two hundred and sixty-six children were born into this business and
          trafficked that year. Alongside me. Two hundred and sixty-six out of
          thousands from the following years, the years before mine, up until
          now—all without identities because they were made for one thing and
          one thing only, to be used this way, to be sold. How could you, Elio?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My head snapped upwards as my eyes met hers, understanding the hate
          within them.
        </p>
        <p>Her words...they were like consecutive slaps to my face.</p>
        <p>
          Her accusation was cutting me more than the fact that this was what my
          father had needed my signature for when I was only nine.
        </p>
        <p>She believed this. She believed I did this.</p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head, watching her with disbelief as hurt made a home in
          the tightness between my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was that time all over again when my mother and siblings had burned
          in that church, my father had spread a rumor, I was accused, and no
          one bothered to check the facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the papers, my gaze falling to the gun. I swallowed, letting
          the silence stretch as I looked back at her. "Well, what are you
          waiting for?" 
        </p>
        <p>She faltered at whatever she saw in my eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "You have it all figured out. I hurt all those children and all those
          people...I am at the end of your gun. Kill me, get revenge once and
          for all, and end the MCSS and me, so I won't hurt any more children
          and order my people around to ensure all the trafficking is conducted
          perfectly and all the pedophiles are well-sated."
        </p>
        <p>"Your fucked up sarcasm isn't really needed right now."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, it didn't sound like the truth? It didn't sound like something I
          would do? Did it sound absurd to you, Zahra?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can't tell me you didn't know this was happening under your name,
          Elio, because that would be a lie. It's too huge to go under your
          nose."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know why you're still here fishing for answers when you
          already made assumptions. You already think I'm capable of doing all
          that is written on this paper. You already look at me with hate; you
          already pointed a gun at me."
        </p>
        <p>I watched her throat work, her chest heaving.</p>
        <p>
          We held our gazes for almost a minute, the doubt in her eyes filling
          the silence, and the hurt I knew was in mine, helping to accentuate
          the tension; I fought to control the dreadful heaviness atop my heart.
          "You don't know me, Zahra." I said, my voice quiet as I swallowed,
          "You don't know what I'm capable of or not—and if I'm being honest,
          your accusation and your assumption without even deeming it fit to ask
          me? Hurts."
        </p>
        <p>"How do you explain the signature—"</p>
        <p>
          "Do I even have to explain anything to you?" The disbelief I felt made
          me wonder if this was really happening—if she was really asking me
          this. "Can't you see I would never be a part of something like this
          with everything you know about me? Isn't my—isn't my character enough
          to tell you that I would never do a thing like this? Isn't my love
          enough to show you that even if I knew about this happening under my
          name, I would tell you when you told me about your past?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't turn this around, what the fuck was I supposed to think? Your
          name was everywhere."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The MCSS has been existing even before I was born! I have never been
          involved in their business, Zahra; neither did I care about what they
          went up to because when I decided to end my life, I was going to end
          this whole empire along with it. That was why I needed to find the
          flash drives. I didn't see one with my name, nor on my empire or my
          father. The MCSS is sovereign. Do you know what sovereign means?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't fucking care." she lied, swallowing as tears welled in her
          eyes. "All I know is you are involved in the very thing
          res—responsible for this broken person that I am today."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned. "Even if you know I didn't actively have anything to do
          with it?"
        </p>
        <p>She didn't answer...</p>
        <p>She didn't want to say something she couldn't take back.</p>
        <p><i>What did she come here hoping to achieve?</i></p>
        <p>
          "You won't have to be at war with yourself if you just believe me—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I chose to believe whatever the hell I want to believe. I have been
          taught a lot of lessons in my life, and I cannot afford another
          one—not with you." her voice shook. "Just give me the damn flash
          drive, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at the drive in my hand, "Is this what you wanted? Is this
          drive the reason why you needed the protection my name offered? You
          have a secret you don't want anyone to know? Or is this all for
          Martino?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She scoffed. "Martino." she mused aloud before she leveled me with a
          glare. "There's no Martino, Elio." She pursed her lips. "There's just
          <i>me</i>. That flash drive belongs to me. I rule Sicily; I
          <i>own</i> Sicily. I've owned it for years."
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew my soldiers would storm this place any minute, but the thought
          at the forefront of my mind was the information she had just let
          loose.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You once asked me who I was." She spoke, her eyes and the tone of her
          voice promising malice, a different kind of composure—one that I saw
          and noted the first time she talked back at me—took over her features.
          "Martino pushed me aside. He was done with me. Told me I could leave.
          He had used me, got all he wanted, and his obsession with me was
          slowly fading away..."
        </p>
        <p>"You told me you left."</p>
        <p>
          "I was naïve, tempted with the thought of freedom that I didn't see he
          had discarded me." She spoke. "I left, yes. But I didn't tell you I
          came back. I came back, and slowly, gradually, I killed him. I made it
          hurt; I made it long, made him suffer because nobody uses me, nobody
          <i>controls</i> me, I am the one who does the throwing away, I am the
          fucking control, I am a fucking god, Elio." She took a step forward.
          "I fought tooth and nail to become somebody in a world where I was
          made to be nobody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martino Conti has not been pronounced dead yet because I willed for it
          to be so. Stopping this ring was my last mission before I settled and
          tried to figure out what I wanted for myself and what I would do with
          the power I acquired after taking his life. I thought I had it all
          figured out. Bring down P. Deluxe Corp, stop the ring, and save a lot
          of people—and maybe I could even get to keep STREET, but then I found
          out that it is much, much, more extensive than I thought, and the man
          that I—the man that I fell for, was the overseer of everything."
        </p>
        <p>
          I could see the strength in which she used to hold the gun. The rate
          at which she was forcing her hate and how her body shook with her
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know the MCSS are sovereign." She bit out. "But without the Marino
          empire, they wouldn't exist; without your legal name as a backup, they
          wouldn't get away with this shit they're doing—trafficking and making
          children in the name of research facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know you were maybe ten years old when I was born. But you're no
          longer ten, Elio. You're not a child; you know right from wrong and
          the consequences of ignorance, yet you choose never to check what
          these people are doing to get you billions of dollars every damn
          month."
        </p>
        <p>I clenched my jaw.</p>
        <p>
          "What makes you think I would believe something so fucking
          unbelievable?" she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because you're hurt, and you're not listening to me, and I
          understand—"
        </p>
        <p>"You don't understand shit about me!"</p>
        <p>
          "If you can just relax, sit down, and come to your senses enough for
          you to think clearly, we wouldn't have to resort to being at odds with
          each other. We can figure something out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want to figure anything out with you, Elio," she quickly
          looked towards the door and then back to me. "Give me the flash
          drive."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not until you listen to me. Por favor, Zahra, drop the gun. In no
          time, my people will storm this room to see you pointing a gun at me
          in this position; after your betrayal today, they will shoot first and
          ask questions later."
        </p>
        <p>"Then give me the drive."</p>
        <p>
          "I am not letting you leave. We can easily sort things out once you
          have a clearer mind."
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of footsteps reached us, and the moment she glanced back at
          the door, I charged, and she gasped as I held her wrist, unannounced,
          raising her hand as a shot from the gun rang out, hitting the wall
          when I rose to my feet, the weight of my body made her move backward,
          as she fought me for the gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let go of the gun," I warned, but her grip was firm, even as I tried
          to pry her fingers from the hilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was panic, anger, and hurt in her eyes, three dangerous emotions
          to be felt all at once. Three emotions that made me rethink our whole
          conversation. The tears that had been in her eyes, her silence when I
          had asked her if she still hated me despite knowing I hadn't been
          actively fueling the MCSS's business.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, we can talk about this."</p>
        <p>
          "Let. Go. of me," she said in a grit, her voice strained as she tried
          to kick me, hit me with her elbows—anything to let me let go of her
          and the gun, but I held firm, not wanting to hurt her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why are you so scared of believing me? I know you know I have nothing
          to do with the MCSS, and I am ready to rectify my mistakes; why do you
          think I will hurt you when you know I do not judge you for your flaws
          and mistakes because we all make them? I love you regardless of your
          identity or anything you have done."
        </p>
        <p>
          She supplied me with a humorless laugh. "Yeah?" she questioned, tears
          filling her eyes. "Even if I confess to being responsible for
          Casmiro's shooting?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I held her wrist tighter as she tried to twist the gun until it was
          right at our sides, and my body pushed hers to the wall.
        </p>
        <p>My eyes burned into hers as I said, "Even then, I love you."</p>
        <p>
          Her lips trembled, her eyes softened, and her chest heaved, but she
          recovered from whatever thought had crossed her mind at that moment as
          her eyes hardened once more. "Well, I don't deserve it, neither do I
          want it, so let me fucking go, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart squeezed. "Never. Not when I know that's not what you want."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's what I fucking want!" She lied and twisted her hand until the
          gun was between us. I felt it slipping from her grip as I fought with
          her fingers to get a hold of it. "Let me go, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>"Why!"</p>
        <p>
          "I just want to leave, okay? I'm done here; give me the flash drive,
          and let me go!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I pinned her body to the wall, pressing against her, locking the
          weapon between us. "You want to leave me, Zahra? Do you think it'll be
          easy knowing all I know now? Did you think telling me all of
          this—hating me for something you know I wasn't responsible for,
          confessing to almost killing Casmiro, and making me think you didn't
          believe me when I told you I knew nothing about the MCSS—would make me
          let you go?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her façade faltered as my fingers worked on the gun between us while
          bringing my face closer to hers, her breathing mingling dangerously
          with mine. "You can run, Zahra; you can run like hell, go wherever the
          fuck you want to go, but know that I would never stop chasing you. I
          will find you every damn time until you realize there is no point in
          running."
        </p>
        <p>
          She closed her eyes, and the tears ran down her cheeks, "Why won't you
          just let me go, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I love you. Because whatever crime you commit is a crime, I
          will forever be willing to forgive."
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head. "No."</p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>"I can't do this."</p>
        <p>"Listen to me—"</p>
        <p>
          "No." She opened her eyes and jerked her body, noticing her loss in
          control of the weapon. Her next move was fast; I didn't see it coming
          until I felt the pain pooling around my jaw from a hit caused by her
          head as she simultaneously slammed her leg against my shin, pushing me
          and getting back control of the gun as she tried to reach for the
          flash drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collected myself, suave my hand, and threw the drive to another
          corner of the office. She charged toward it, but my body quickly
          covered hers while my hand covered hers on the gun. This time, I
          didn't hold back on my strength as I tried prying her fingers off the
          weapon, leaning my weight over her.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, listen!"</p>
        <p>
          The sound of the hotel door slamming open made her jump, faltering her
          fight and grip on herself as the weight of my body forcefully pushed
          hers to the wall, and the gun went off between us at the impact.
        </p>
        <p>She sucked in a sharp breath.</p>
        <p>I froze.</p>
        <p>Our struggling stopped as footsteps rushed into our space.</p>
        <p>
          But they dulled out into background noises as the gun clattered to the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her breathing shuddered as she looked up at me, lips parted, eyes
          glistening; and slowly, ever so slowly, in my shocked stupor, I looked
          between us—her chest—there was a rapidly spreading red stain on the
          white tank top she wore.
        </p>
        <p>My heart stopped.</p>
        <p>My mind stopped.</p>
        <p>Everything stopped.</p>
        <p>
          "El..." her voice dropped faintly as she instinctively gripped the
          shirt around my bicep.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last thing my sanity registered was the tiny sound of her breath
          stopping, the single tear that slipped from her drooping eyes, and her
          knees completely giving out right before me.
        </p>
