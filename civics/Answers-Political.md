# Challenges a political party face

1. Lack of internal democracy
   
   - Consentration of power in one hand -`Make it so that for every choice the party  makes, there will be a voting process`
   
   - Not-so-inflesivive people have no power to say `open up  more opportunities for low-level ppl of the party to rise up in power`
   
   - No membership registers `Make a law so that all members of the party are recorded in a register`

2. Dynastic succssion `Make it so that the party members have an internal election`

3. Money and Muscle power 

4. No meaningful choice to the voters
