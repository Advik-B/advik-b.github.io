            dark, they can be superstitious, and sometimes they can be
            supernatural.

          A LITTLE NOTE: THE UPDATES WILL BE SPONTANEOUS AS I CAN NOT BE
          COMMITTED TO A SCHEDULE AT THIS TIME! If you follow my Instagram, you
          will see that ELIO MARINO is in the process of getting traditionally
          published. This new opportunity comes with a lot of revisions that
          take up most of my time, so I will not be as focused as I was on the
          first book!
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS IS A LIFE-CHANGING experience for me, and it would not have been
          possible without you guys!
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't been asked to take down the Wattpad versions of this series,
          but I will let you know before that action is taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all this said! DON'T FORGET TO VOTE AND COMMENT COMMENT COMMENT
          LIKE THE NEXT UPDATE DEPENDS ON IT. IT ACTUALLY DOES! I SEE
          EXCITEMENT, AND I'M MORE COMPELLED TO SQUEEZE IN TIME! THE COMMENTS ON
          THE CHARACTER AESTHETIC CHAPTER THREW ME AWAY AND I SAID, HELL NO! I
          CAN TAKE OUT TWO DAYS TO WRITE THIS FIRST PART!
        </p>
        <p>So, I do hope you enjoy this chapter!</p>
        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p><i>*Hours after Zahra was shot*</i></p>
        <p><b>IT WAS </b>replaying.</p>
        <p>
          Over and over again in my head. The sound of the gun going off, the
          vibration of the weapon against our grips, the soft and shuddery sound
          of her gasp, my name on her lips—<i>incomplete</i>. Her eyes had
          closed before she could speak it. Her body had gone limp in my arms
          before I could process it, and her heart—her heart, for a moment, had
          stopped beating. I heard nothing, felt nothing.
        </p>
        <p>All I saw was red.</p>
        <p>
          Blood—her blood had been everywhere, all over my hands, my clothes, my
          face, her face, her body; I was blinded by the color, overwhelmed by
          the smell of gunpowder, irritated by the sticky thickness of the blood
          bathing us—of <i>her </i>blood bathing us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed my eyelids tight, my grip hard on the sink, trying and
          failing to tame the emotions warring inside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dragging in a breath, I held it and let it out seconds later before
          opening my eyes and watching my reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shirtless with blood stains around my neck, my eyes looked haunted—a
          look that mirrored the exact way I felt. My gaze dropped to the
          necklace dangling around my neck, the one she had gifted me on my
          birthday, one I'd appreciated but couldn't remember appreciating.
        </p>
        <p><i>Zahra. </i></p>
        <p>
          I dropped my head and swallowed tightly, removing my hands from both
          sides of the sink; hands...recently washed off her blood, shook
          fervently, my veins were pronounced, and there was a buzz centering
          from my wrists to the tip of my pale fingers, almost like my body had
          stopped supplying blood to my hands, a punishment I deserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was all my fault. Mine. It didn't matter who pulled the trigger or
          who held the gun. All that mattered was that I was there, I was
          present, and it happened. I shot her.
        </p>
        <p>I folded my hands into fists.</p>
        <p>
          Anger at myself washed my senses out of rationality. I wasn't
          breathing normally; neither was I thinking normally.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind replayed it. Her body violently lifting from the bed as they
          tried to shock her heart back alive. Over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of the defibrillator before it met with her chest, the pain
          from how hard I had clenched my jaw, watching the whole scene without
          a single thought or expression. I knew she would come back. She was
          stronger than that. She was Zahra, capable of anything, everything,
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>A mere bullet to the chest was nothing when it came to her.</p>
        <p>My better half was a survivor. She wouldn't stop being one now.</p>
        <p><i>I prayed she wouldn't stop. </i></p>
        <p>
          I was proven right when we got a pulse. My boldness didn't stop me
          from letting out a breath of relief, feeling like a whole nation had
          left my shoulders. It took everything in me not to double over in
          relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know how scared I was until the straight line left the heart
          monitor, and her heart started beating again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I didn't know how much I needed this woman until I almost lost her.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><i>*Three weeks after* </i></p>
        <p>Zahra had entered into a coma.</p>
        <p>
          The uncertainty of her recovery plagued me fiercely day and night. I
          lost focus on many things. She came first, and everything else came
          second—even Elia, who hadn't left my side through the ordeal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It came to my notice two weeks ago that STREET had separated. Elia
          claimed not to know their whereabouts. Or if they knew about Zahra's
          condition.
        </p>
        <p>I wasn't the least bothered.</p>
        <p>Zahra was my priority.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Casmiro's voice had me raising my head as I swallowed the
          whiskey I had just taken in. I nodded lightly in response. "I wanted
          to talk to you about the meetings with—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I told you not to bother me about work." I downed the remaining
          content in the glass, swallowing and refilling it again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, it's been weeks. I think it's time to deal with the aftermath
          of this whole shit."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, dropping my glass on the counter as I turned and kept my
          eyes on him for almost a minute before leaving the bar area, shoving
          my hands into my pants pocket, walking past him, and saying, "Leave."
          Without waiting to see what he'd do next.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How long will this go on for?" He called out when I neared the door,
          "She's going to die." He blurted, and I froze away from pulling the
          door open.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard him sigh. "Listen, E, I know you don't want to hear this, but
          she's done. We're only wasting precious time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I gritted, trying my best to keep my anger at bay. "Do you now have
          the ability to tell when someone would live or die?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "She is not responding to treatments. The doctors say there is a very
          slim possibility she would survive this. They have done all they
          could."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then let her catch up. Do not kill her before she dies. I do not want
          to speak of this with you anymore." I placed my hand on the knob of
          the door, twisting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She deserves it." He spoke again, stopping me. "She is supposed to be
          dead because she betrayed us. She betrayed you. Do you even know who
          she is? This was all a ploy; you were nothing but a pawn in her
          fucking game Elio; she's a fucking cunt who would—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned, charging towards him with a wave of blinding anger that
          raged from the pit of my stomach as I slammed my fist into his jaw,
          sending him straight to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          He held the side of his face, disbelief and anger shining in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Watch your fucking mouth, Valerio."</p>
        <p>
          He glared, his breathing ragged as he got to his feet. "This is how it
          is now?" he questioned. "You hit me for a fucking woman?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "<i>My</i> fucking woman." I seethed. "Disrespect her again, and I
          forget every relationship I share with you and your family. Do not
          push me."
        </p>
        <p>
          His nostrils flared, jaw clenching and unclenching as he straightened
          his suit and walked past me, out the door without another word.
        </p>
        <p>__</p>
        <p><i>*A month after*</i></p>
        <p>Zahra had been fixed on life support after almost dying.</p>
        <p>
          That night marked the most stressful night I'd ever had to go through.
          I heard no new update in hours, and even after the updates came
          informing me she had been fixed on life support, I was spiraling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still had no control over the situation. This was beyond my
          capability; talking, sleeping, and reading beside her while she
          remained unresponsive did nothing to pull her back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had contemplated for weeks about going to the church within the
          compound, knowing I wasn't welcomed there, not after that fire, not
          when the building had been rebuilt and refurnished.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was losing hope, and even though the higher powers had never
          once answered my prayers, I was stepping into the church like I did 15
          years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't go further towards the altar. I couldn't. My heart was
          already hammering. A twinge of fear was already settling, and I found
          a pew far back from the altar to sit. My feelings were conflicted. The
          energy in this space was heavy. As heavy as it had always been, but
          something about it made my burden feel twice as much as it had been.
          Guilt was pulling me under.
        </p>
        <p>It felt like someone was watching me, waiting for me to speak.</p>
        <p>
          But I didn't utter a word. My throat felt tight, my mouth felt sore,
          and my whole body didn't agree with my surroundings. I was too
          overwhelmed, too scared to speak. I wasn't ready to be back in here. I
          didn't deserve to be back in here. My prayers did not deserve to be
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shot up from the pew and exited the church, taking in a lung full of
          air.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mother might have once found comfort within the four walls of this
          church, but it didn't erase the fact that she had also spent her last
          moment in this same church.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was still unstable. I still had nightmares. I skipped therapy. I
          missed hours of self-realization. I was drowning in loss. And I was
          drowning fast.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><i>*Two months after*</i></p>
        <p>Nothing changed.</p>
        <p>
          I put Elia in charge of several affairs I would have loved to see
          through.
        </p>
        <p>
          To my surprise, he was brilliant regarding legal state affairs. We had
          similar ideas and problem-solving skills. Sitting with him and
          discussing areas I'd like him to focus on were the best three hours I
          had in the past two months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want him near the business, but he had offered to help with
          the little things he knew I couldn't focus on. So I had him working
          with Casmiro and Angelo while I alternated between therapy, which I
          never indeed attended as frequently as I should, and Zahra, who I
          couldn't stay away from.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctors attending to her had once approached me with the option of
          taking her off life support to see how she does, but the risk of
          actually losing her from that process made me refuse.
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't lose her.</p>
        <p>I won't.</p>
        <p>
          It was only a matter of time; no matter how long it would take to wait
          for her to get up and breathe independently, I'd wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd wait for this woman through anything. I just needed her to realize
          that it was okay to wake up. I wasn't angry, I wouldn't let anyone
          hurt her, I didn't care that she pointed a gun at me, I didn't care
          that she betrayed me, it didn't matter, neither did it tweak my
          feelings for her. It was still there; she still occupied the space she
          held in my heart, which was enlarging with each passing day I didn't
          get to hear her speak to me, or laugh, or curse at me each day I
          didn't get to see her smile, feel her warmth, her kisses, and her
          touch.
        </p>
        <p>I longed for her more than I'd ever longed for anything.</p>
        <p>I needed to make her understand that.</p>
        <p>If only she would just wake up. If not for anything, but for me.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><i>*Three months after*</i></p>
        <p>Zahra disappeared.</p>
        <p>No trace. No evidence of her being moved. No noise.</p>
        <p>
          I left her side for just two hours—two hours, and she disappeared the
          same way night disappears when morning appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not even a flicker of an idea as to what might have happened. No CCTV
          camera picked up anything.
        </p>
        <p>I was confused. I was angry.</p>
        <p>I raged, I killed, I punished, and I searched and searched.</p>
        <p>Three, two, four, five months. </p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>
          She was just...gone. She ceased to exist. I had lost the only reason I
          was living.
        </p>
        <p>I had lost Zahra.</p>
        <p>And it was all my fault. <br /><br /><br /></p>

          How did Zahra leave the Marino compound? do you think she had help? if
          you think so, who do you think help move her?

          I wanted to address something real quick before we start this chapter!
          while I love that you guys love this story so much, and you are very
          vocal about it, I want to please ask that you don't spam me with dms
          asking for updates. It is not as though I have the chapters and I'm
          holding off from updating to torture you guys. I AM NOT. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I don't have the luxury of time as I once used to. I have
          strict deadlines, and so many behind the scenes work I'm doing. I
          leaped at my career as an author, and this leap comes with a lot of my
          time. Hence, why you won't see an update until I have time to write
          one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be patient with me, and keep in mind that there will come a
          time when this whole series will be taken off Wattpad because of
          publishing. As I said last time, I don't know when this will happen,
          but it will happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love you guys so much, but the update requests from every angle had
          me feeling like Zahra when Dog kept calling her name while she was
          trying to focus on stopping a bomb.

        <p><b>Milk (Penelope) </b></p>
        <p><b>New York, Queens: 7 months after Zahra's disappearance </b></p>
        <p>
          <b>THE URGE </b>to snap to my feet and tell this man to leave me alone
          was as strong as the effect of the coffee on my grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppressed a groan, watching him scarf down his breakfast while I
          shook my head with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, Penelope," He started. "You think about it yet?" he asked, wiping
          the side of his mouth with the back of his hand. "I found a client
          willing to buy the establishment; all you just gotta do is say the
          word."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why don't you listen to a word I say, Mr. Kim? The store is fine, I'm
          fine, I'm doing okay. You checked the books; we're doing better than I
          expected going into this."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "I know, Pen, that's why selling now is advisable. How long
          can you sustain your capital? You're a young woman, and there's
          nowhere else you're getting money from, as far as I'm aware? You have
          to repay the loan you used for the start-up. If you sell now, you can
          repay the loan and still have enough to fend for yourself for a
          while."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew a breath, looking around the breakfast place we were at; the
          sound of chattering and the ambiance from the busy streets of Queens
          calmed the annoyance brewing inside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at the man; his dark hair was well trimmed, and his suit
          was rough like he hadn't gotten the time to properly iron it before
          rushing out this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          He met my gaze. "You have to consider this, Penelope. Now's the only
          time you can sell. It's a new year, and many deals are closing. We're
          fortunate to find this client; no one would pay such a prize for your
          establishment further into the year."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, rubbing the side of my head to ease off the stress-causing
          headaches. Mr. Kim had been the guidance I needed a year ago when I
          moved to New York with my dreams on my sleeves. He found a busy space
          to start my salon, beauty, and spa place. We had even expanded later
          on to an exclusive store that sold only designer wear and branded
          products the market loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was huge. I had a strong team working with me. I had friends, a new
          life, and a fresh start-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I might have lied to him that I burrowed a considerable loan to
          start the business, I had no way of explaining to the man that I had
          millions of gold bars under my name in a bank vault somewhere. I
          didn't think he would be on my neck now, asking me to sell due to the
          risk of a fallout.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the coffee cup and leveled him with a stare. "I am fine,
          honestly, I don't want to sell. The business is thriving. Besides, I
          already paid off the loan."
        </p>
        <p>
          He stopped eating almost immediately. A deep frown dragged his brows
          down. "What?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I paid it off. I worked my ass off, and I paid the loan. My next move
          is to buy the building; you also don't have to worry about that. I am
          already in contact with the property owner."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now he looked pissed. "When were you planning to tell me all this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't need to tell you, Mr. Kim. This is my business. I appreciate
          all the help you have given me so far. I have even paid you generously
          for it, and like I said the last time we spoke, I truly do not need
          your help anymore. I'm sure you have better things to do and bigger
          clients to attend to. I can take it from here."
        </p>
        <p>He relaxed back on his booth. "So that's it?"</p>
        <p>"That's it."</p>
        <p>"You're not gonna pay me off?"</p>
        <p>I gasped. "I already paid you, Mr. Kim. What more do you want?"</p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched. "I have been burning hours trying to find you a
          client that would give you a damn good deal; I deserve compensation
          for that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I never told you I wanted to sell. You did all of that on your own."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Still. I deserve something." He leaned in now, eyes hard. "If it
          weren't for me, you would have been lost and cheated and duped out of
          all the loans you got. I helped you. I deserve a payoff."
        </p>
        <p>
          I resisted the urge to tell him that he wasn't the only agent in the
          whole of fucking New York as I whipped out my phone, fingers bashing
          the screen for a few minutes before a chime went off on his phone, and
          he frowned, pulling it out of his pocket as he checked the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes went very wide, and he started choking on air. "What the—"
        </p>
        <p>"Is that enough to get you the fuck out of my life?"</p>
        <p>
          "One—one million dollars?" he wheezed out, still staring at his
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got to my feet, grabbing my bag and sunglasses from the table. "This
          should be the last I see or hear from you, Mr. Kim. Our business is
          done."
        </p>
        <p>
          His head snapped up, eyes blinking rapidly in bewilderment.
          "Where—where the hell did you get this kind of money?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed my gaze to train directly to his as I smiled and said
          softly, "I stole it." I slid on the sunglasses and left the gaping man
          behind as I stepped out of the store to where my car was parked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Settling inside the car, I removed the sunglasses, slipped them into
          my bag, and breathed to calm myself.
        </p>
        <p>I counted down from five to one, pride filling me.</p>
        <p>I did that.</p>
        <p>
          I just told Mr. Kim off and shut him up with money that didn't leave a
          dent in my bank account.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am cool," I said to myself as I set my phone on the dash to charge
          and turned the rearview mirror to my face, arranging my red hair,
          "Cool, beautiful, bold Penelope Canavan," I said, getting my emergency
          lip gloss from the console and applying it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was satisfied, I reset the rearview mirror, started the engine,
          and pulled out of the parking spot into the road, turning on the
          speakers and blasting songs from my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a lot planned today—first, a short visit to my company and then
          Malia's baby shower. I couldn't miss that. Malia had been an enormous
          support when I first started my business. We were close friends, not
          as close as Sharon and I, but we got along well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharon was my assistant, friend, and well—soul sister. We bonded the
          first time we had seen each other at a beauty store and talked
          non-stop about everything and anything. We met Malia through a mutual
          friend of Sharon's, and a month ago, we all had a girl's week with
          Gemma, who had flown from Italy to attend. Those were days I would
          never forget.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had another trip planned, but we were all waiting for Malia to have
          her baby, rest, and recover so we could have a week with literally no
          limit.
        </p>
        <p>I looked forward to that.</p>
        <p>
          My phone lit up, and the ringing tone cut through the car's speakers.
          I glanced at it to see that it was an unknown number.
        </p>
        <p>Frowning, I clicked accept.</p>
        <p>
          "Hello?" I said, wondering if Sharon had given out my number to one of
          her male friends—
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hi, Milk," </i></p>
        <p>
          I pressed my foot on the brake pedal, and the car halted immediately,
          jerking me forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          A loud honk resounded from behind my car as the vehicle swerved by me,
          their middle finger right out their window as they cursed my poor
          driving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this wasn't my poor driving skill...this was my heart pounding,
          and my thoughts and mind and time coming to a complete stop at the
          familiar voice that filled the confinement of my car.
        </p>
        <p><i>"I hope I didn't cause an accident, the honks and all."</i></p>
        <p>
          I blinked and blinked and then blinked again, swallowing the lump in
          my throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Are you alive? Half dead? Because I can hear breathing...it's
            sounding a bit labored and—"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>"How did you get my number?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Oh, you're okay." </i> She sounded relieved.
          <i>"How are you? It has been a while." </i>
        </p>
        <p>A year.</p>
        <p>
          A year since we had last seen each other. Seven months since she
          disappeared.
        </p>
        <p><i>Seven months of everyone thinking she was dead. </i></p>
        <p><i>"Are you—" </i></p>
        <p>"How did you get this number? What do you want from me?"</p>
        <p>
          There was a short pause. "<i
            >I had some experts fish it out for me; it didn't take too much
            work—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"What do you want?"</p>
        <p>
          She sighed.
          <i>"I was...I was hoping we could catch up first before I—" </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please just...tell me what you want; I have to hang up soon." My
          voice shook, but it was still sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"All right. I uh...I wouldn't have called so suddenly. But I had no

        <p><b>Upper (Archie) </b></p>
        <p><b>England, Birmingham: 7 months after Zahra's disappearance </b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I SAT </b>slumped at the dining table as Danika, one of my
          housemates, sled a plate filled with pancakes and a glass of orange
          juice in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>"Thank—you," I said while stifling a yawn. "God, I'm so tired."</p>
        <p>
          "That's what happens when you stay up all night catching up on
          coursework." Taylor, another housemate, slapped my back, not too
          forcefully, as he took the seat beside me, and Danika sled his own
          plate to him. "Thanks, smells delicious."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Weren't you supposed to resume physical lectures this week?" Danika
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Last week," Taylor answered for me with his mouth full.</p>
        <p>
          "What happened? Having second thoughts?" Danika sat opposite me, a
          plate in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pancakes actually tasted good, but like always, they were missing
          something. "I'm not having second thoughts," I said after swallowing.
          "I just haven't had the time for it. I've been busy with...stuff."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What stuff?" She asked, and I could feel Taylor's eyes on me, waiting
          for my response.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met them while searching for a moderate apartment that didn't
          scream, 'I had too much money than I should have.'
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't have enough money, and I didn't want to live alone, so I
          told them I was renting a 5-room apartment, and they could pay me
          quarterly the amount they would have had to pay monthly until they
          decided to move out.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, they thought I was joking or pulling a fast one on them, but
          I reassured them that I didn't want to live alone and I needed a big
          spaced apartment. I also had Rita and Jared. Rita was mainly at her
          boyfriend's and planned to move in with him next year, and Jared was
          either sleeping in, at the frat house, out for a run, at basketball
          practice, or a friend's.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all went to Aston University, where I also schooled online,
          trying to go physical—but I still doubted that decision. I couldn't
          afford to be seen or tracked further than I already had been.
        </p>
        <p>"Just stuff," I shrugged.</p>
        <p>
          "Sitting in your room, writing essays or playing video games?" Taylor
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't know how serious these essays are. They require full
          attention." I said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You study computer science." Danika pointed out. "Sure, they'd be
          essays, but not as much as me, who takes creative writing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well—I study things in other places too. It gets a little... hectic."
        </p>
        <p>
          Taylor scoffed. "The day I understand what goes on in that mind of
          yours is the day I tell everyone I'm actually adopted and my father is
          some washed-up actor no one remembers—ow."
        </p>
        <p>I just knew Danika had kicked him from underneath the table.</p>
        <p>
          "It's okay, Archie," She said softly. "whatever your reason for
          stalling is, I hope you figure it out."
        </p>
        <p>I smiled at her. "Thanks, Dani."</p>
        <p>
          The front door opened, and I lifted my head to see Jared's tall, broad
          figure walking in with his gaze focused on the mail in his grip; he
          was wearing his jogging gear.
        </p>
        <p>"Archie, you uh...got mail from...the royal—"</p>
        <p>
          I shot up from the table, rushed towards him, snatched the mail from
          his hand, and dashed back to my room, slamming the door shut and
          bolting it.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, no, no, no, no, how the fuck did they find my address?"</p>
        <p>
          I went to my shredding machine, and without opening the mail, I shoved
          the envelope inside as the shredding sounds filled the space, calming
          my anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          I breathed, falling back on the wall as I closed my eyes. "Bloody
          hell."
        </p>
        <p>
          My family had been trying every single means to get me back. My father
          had reached out; my stepmother had hired a private investigator; my
          uncle, who had never once smiled at me, had been trying to involve the
          media, even my bloody terrifying fucking aunt, whose name I still did
          not know how to pronounce.
        </p>
        <p>I was confused, disturbed, uncomfortable, and beyond frustrated.</p>
        <p>
          Something must have gone wrong, and they probably wanted me to fill
          the shoes of my stepbrother, but hell, if I'm ever going back there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was beginning to start my life again after everything that happened
          a year ago; I was moving on, getting on my feet despite how hard it
          had been for me, how broken I had been for months, hearing what had
          happened to Zahra, and how she had disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord knows I had tried to locate her, but there had been nothing—no
          clues as to where she might have been or who had taken her; she was
          just gone, disappeared from the face of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gone for so long, I'd even mourned her death because I knew she had
          many enemies and anyone could have taken her in that state...it had
          been a truly tough time, but then I had moved on from that too.
        </p>
        <p>I'd made my peace with it and had only started living again.</p>
        <p>Until that phone call from my father.</p>
        <p>
          Everything turned upside fucking down, and I was spending my time
          making myself a ghost once more, blocking the media from displaying
          anything about me; I was doing so much work and was slowly going mad
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I jerked upright and opened my eyes when my phone started blaring.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh God, please," I whined, the urge to cry biting at my insides as
          bile gathered in my throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dreadfully picked up the phone, not even having the strength to
          investigate why it said an unknown caller or which of my family
          members was on the line. I was pissed, I was angry, and I was in a
          shit mood, and all these emotions mean the same bloody thing, and I
          hate my life because of all the terrible people in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever this fucker was, they were about to get a piece of my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I forcefully slid to answer and placed the phone against my ear. "Now
          you listen and listen very fucking <i>bloody</i> good because I will
          not repeat it. Stop. Calling. Me, stop stalking me and sending me
          mails and making my life a living bloody hell because you might run me
          into a mental institution at this rate, and I do not like mental
          institutions because they have a certain nauseating smell that just
          follows you everywhere so please, please, leave me alone, I don't have
          any interest in ruling or being a part of the family, I don't want you
          guys back, do you not know when someone doesn't like you anymore?
          Please stop calling before I result in assassination because I can. I
          can get on the bloody dark web and find some sicko who just wants to
          waste royal people for no reason at all and trust me; they are many.

        </p>
        <p>
          Just because I didn't know how to lead with all she had just said, I
          put it behind me. "It's all right; what up?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Was that too casual? Should I even be asking? Why am I asking that
          when I should ask basic questions like—You're not dead? Where the fuck
          have you been? How did you get my number?

        <p>
          <b>THE MAN, </b>playing with his ten-year-old daughter at the park,
          wearing a grey polo and jean pants, would die tomorrow, at 9:56 AM
          from a heart attack in his office, which stood three buildings away
          from the coffee shop I currently sat at, watching them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked like a decent enough guy, but he must have pissed off some
          really bad guys along the way, and now he would die for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cause: Association with people he wasn't supposed to be associated
          with.
        </p>
        <p>Did I feel bad?</p>
        <p>
          For him, no...but for his kid, yes. She would be made fatherless
          tomorrow, and a guy sitting at the coffee shop not too far from her
          would be responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had resumed my business as E2, it was now more under wraps than it
          had been before, seeing as Elio's eyes watched me like a hawk
          twenty-four fucking seven, and I knew it was only a matter of time
          before he plucked out the reason why I randomly disappeared at night
          or most times, at noon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew he had initially tried to give me my privacy, but then I had
          left and hadn't returned three days straight, blocking all connections
          to avoid a compromised mission. You could have guessed how that went
          down with Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been calm while he told me to get the fuck out of our house;
          although he didn't use that language, he was surprisingly polite about
          it. He told me how he had wasted resources and wouldn't like to do
          that in the near future, so he would like me to leave if I wasn't
          going to tell him why I had disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, I had tried to dish out a lie or two, but he would stare at
          me and tell me to my face that he knew it was a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was annoying and made things extra difficult for me. Still,
          thankfully, Angelo was around to help me talk to him, and I was later
          asked to apologize and even had to write a statement that if I
          randomly disappeared, I should stay gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was getting on his nerves, and he was getting on mine, but our
          relationship had improved, I wouldn't lie. He was there for me—<i
            >too there for me</i
          >—and I was also there for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, we had just returned from his therapy session, and I had
          convinced him to stop by a coffee shop where we could wait for Alizea,
          his friend who was returning from a short visit to Gran Louisa, who
          had been her patient for almost five months now.
        </p>
        <p>
          About six months ago, Gran Louisa had fallen very ill. It had been a
          devastating time for Elio and mostly Gemma. Honestly, none of us
          thought she was going to make it through, and Gemma had already
          started funeral plans based on Gran Louisa's request in wanting to
          know and be involved with the plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone else didn't know Gran Louisa like we did, they would have
          thought she was excited to die.
        </p>
        <p>She probably was.</p>
        <p>
          Based on his therapist's recommendation, Elio had gotten the best
          doctor for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctor Alizea Moloi came at a high price, but she knew what she was
          doing. Gran Louisa had gotten back on her feet after Alizea stepped
          in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, she became close friends with Elio. I had suspected
          something more was going on because they had a one-month vacation
          recently, where they traveled around. I had accompanied them for the
          last week of the holiday because Elio had sent for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I arrived, I noticed a change in my brother; he seemed calmer,
          less overbearing, and sometimes, acted odd and out of character. I
          couldn't tell if it was pretense, and I also couldn't tell if he had
          taken up his new painting hobby as a form of stress relief or as a way
          to impress Alizea, but I was glad he was doing a little better.
        </p>
        <p>He had been a total mess after Zahra's disappearance.</p>
        <p>
          My brother had spiraled; he had become so...<i>dark</i> in his
          dealings. Scared the fuck out of me for months, but then Gran Louisa's
          issue came up, and it grounded him a bit; then came Alizea, who I knew
          helped pull him out of his own shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although...while I didn't like to notice these little flaws in his
          'new' character, I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes...hell, just yesterday, he had stunned me, Casmiro, and
          Angelo with a final decision to a mission that had resulted in a blood
          bath while he had stood and watched with that damn cigar burning away
          on his lips after the casualties that could have been avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had watched him slip on his glasses. His face was totally void of
          emotion as he returned to the car he had arrived in and simply drove
          off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo had been disappointed, Casmiro stressed; I was angry because I
          knew I would return to our new place outside the compound, and he
          would pretend to be all kind and changed and fucking confusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speak of the devil, I straightened and turned off the AirPods in my
          ear, cutting off my music when he settled back opposite me with two
          cups of coffee in his grip. He set one in front of me and held on to
          the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our dress sense was the same: black on black. While I was wearing a
          black Henley shirt and jeans, he wore a black turtle neck sweater and
          black slacks. Then again—it's all he ever wears.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Then again</i>, I'd admired my brother's ways of doing most things
          since I was little...when I wished to be exactly like him.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't say anything about the copying if he'd noticed it.</p>
        <p>
          "What does sex on legs mean?" he asked suddenly, and I paused with a
          frown.
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          "Sex on legs," he repeated. "I was called that by the woman in pink. I
          heard her whisper it to her friend. What does it mean?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked at him, wondering how the fuck I was going to answer that
          question. "Uh...It's like a...I don't know, sexual term to—appreciate
          the physic of someone?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded slowly. "I see." He said, drinking from his cup. "Did Alizea
          call to tell you when she would be here?"
        </p>
        <p>"Not yet, but she shouldn't be long."</p>
        <p>
          "Good." He flexed his neck muscles. "I have burnt all social energy
          for today, and I have more important work than sitting outside. Doing
          nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
          I was about to respond when my phone rang out. I checked to see that
          it was an unknown number.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, glancing at Elio, who had picked up his phone, fingers
          typing on the screen, paying me no mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the phone again, I diverted the call to voicemail and
          turned on my AirPods.
        </p>
        <p>The voice that came in had me freezing.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Hi, Devil. I know you are listening. This is Zahra. I'll make this
            number available so you can call me back when you get this..."</i
          >
          There was a slight pause and a soft sigh. <i>"I need your help." </i>
        </p>
        <p>Then the mail ended.</p>
        <p>
          I sat still, staring at my phone with a completely blank mind, unable
          to comprehend the voice that had just spoken to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Should I be concerned?" Elio's voice had me flinching, and I looked
          up. His eyes were still on the phone. "You suddenly went pale," he
          said, then raised his head. "Who was that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, drinking three large gulps of the coffee as I said in
          the most disinterested way I could pull off. "No one important."
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised a brow, gaze dropping to my phone before lifting back to
          me—and as usual, I couldn't read whatever thought might have crossed
          his mind. It always had a way of putting me on edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          But thankfully, he didn't comment further, and I was left with my mind
          replaying that voicemail repeatedly.

          <b>"DETECTIVE REAGAN,"</b> I flashed my badge at the MPD officer.
          "With the feds," I said, slipping the badge inside my jacket. "What
          are we looking at?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The officer, a blonde-haired man with an angry face, scrutinized me
          with an irritated expression as his gaze shifted behind me to see the
          agent I had <i>accompanied</i>—the agent that was my
          <i>partner</i>—speaking to some officers right outside, along with
          Holly, our on-scene forensic agent, and then brought his gaze back to
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You think I won't know a training badge when I see one,
          <i>detective?</i>"
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, exasperated, "I just knew, from the blonde hair and the
          uneven eyebrows, that you were the
          <i>'I stick to the protocols like there's a stick up my ass'</i> kinda
          cop."
        </p>
        <p>"Excuse me—"</p>
        <p>
          "Training badge, real badge? What's the fucking difference. We all
          wanna find the bad guy and put someone behind bars, right..." I looked
          at his tiny name tag. "Harris?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay!" my <i>partner's</i> voice<i> </i>filled<i> </i>the space as<i
          > </i>he walked up to us, climbing up the porch with Holly, who
          swiftly walked by and inside the house with a camera. My
          <i>partner</i> placed a hand on my shoulder and pulled me back a
          little with a hard squeeze. "I'm Detective Butcher. Reagan, here is my
          trainee." He introduced. "Officers there said you were in charge?"
        </p>
        <p>
          With one last irritated sweep my way, the cop looked at Butcher,
          outstretching his hands for a handshake. "Agent Harris, MPD assistant
          director, district five."
        </p>
        <p>Oh shit.</p>
        <p>
          "Your people say we are looking at a double homicide," Butcher said as
          they both walked into the house toward the crime scene, ignoring me as
          I followed behind, my eyes taking in the man and woman, all bloodied
          up, pale, and very fucking dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," Agent Harris responded, "We got called up this morning; ghastly
          sight, this one."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes took in the man who had been stripped naked, with duct tape on
          his crotch, as if someone tried to hold off the bleeding from his
          penis, which had been cut off. Multiple stab wounds littered his
          chest—someone had been hard at it with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking over at the woman beside him, her eyes were wide open and
          lifeless, and her mouth was opened too—I tilted my head to the side a
          little—the man's cut-off dick had been shoved down her throat, the tip
          peeking out of her mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          She also had multiple stab wounds, bruises on her wrists, ankles, left
          cheek, and a handprint around her neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          I crouched down with a frown, checking the fingernails of both the
          victims. They had been pried off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holly took a picture, crouching opposite me as she mumbled. "To think
          the person who did this is still roaming around,"
        </p>
        <p>"A lot of fucked up people in this world," I muttered.</p>
        <p>
          "That's Richard and Valerie Stoneman," Agent Harris spoke. "This was
          called in by their kid, only 13. Said the intruder had locked him in.
          Could hear the screams."
        </p>
        <p>"Poor kid," Holly said.</p>
        <p>
          I looked to my right, through the window of the house, and I could see
          the kid sitting at the back of a truck, a towel around his shoulders,
          as he spoke to another agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at the bodies. "This was clearly a crime of passion," I
          said aloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you would know that how?" Harris asked in a condescending tone. I
          glanced at Butcher, and he gave me a slight nod to carry on.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The victims had clearly known the killer, or maybe one of them did."
          I pointed to the stab wounds on their bodies. "These were done without
          precision. It almost looks vengeful, like they were screaming or
          yelling while they stabbed,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Harris scoffed, "You guessed all that because the stab wounds are all
          over the place?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Trust him; he's rarely wrong," Butcher defended, and Harris kept
          quiet as I continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The bruises around Valerie's wrist and ankle show she'd been tied
          up...not with a rope. Telling from the sharpness of the bruise, it had
          been a zip tie—I'm guessing stainless steel ones. She was made to
          watch her husband get tortured," I said, looking over the bodies again
          and then around the torn-apart living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dining chair was in the middle, shattered with a long rope by the
          side. One leg of the chair was bloodied and carelessly thrown in the
          corner.
        </p>
        <p><i>We might have found our killer.</i></p>
        <p>
          "Valerie had been tied up on that chair; she broke free after her
          husband's penis had been cut off; she had attacked the killer somehow
          and stabbed him with that chair leg. The killer had probably gotten
          furious, attacked her, swung the stick to the side, hit her—telling
          from the bruise on her cheek—and then when she'd probably fallen, The
          killer had shoved her husband's cock—I mean Penis, in her mouth. She
          had been strangled, too, I can't be sure until we get an autopsy, but
          she might have been raped, her dress is torn, and there had been a
          little struggle. The rug is rumpled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The killer had duck taped Richard's crotch to still the bleeding,
          probably to make it all last longer, then he tortured them, Stabbed
          him to death first, and then her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final guess. The killer had been a man. I can't be sure about that
          either, but with all I can see...I know it's someone they know. Did we
          do any instant background check?"
        </p>
        <p>I asked, looking up at Harris.</p>
        <p>
          All he did was blink at me, but Holly answered. "One of the cops
          outside said Valerie's ex-husband had been released from prison about
          a month ago, but he lives in another continent entirely." She said,
          getting up from her crouched position. "We'll get the evidence sampled
          and see what we can dig up."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks, Holly," I said, and she nodded with a smile that said good
          job before walking out of the house.
        </p>
        <p>My phone vibrated in my jacket, and I fished for it.</p>
        <p>
          An unknown number was calling, and my heart skipped a beat as my mind
          worked ahead of me.

          I shot to my feet, glancing at Butcher and Harris. "Gotta take this,
          I'll be back."
        </p>
        <p>
          I stepped out onto the porch, accepting the call with my heart in my
          throat. "Reagan,"
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hello, Dog," </i></p>
        <p>
          I frowned, stopping short at the familiar voice...and the name they'd
          call me.
        </p>
        <p>"Who is this?"</p>
        <p><i>"Zahra,"</i></p>
        <p><i>What the actual fuck?</i></p>
        <p>
          I stepped further away from the house. My frown hardened, and my
          stomach dipped as I clenched my jaw, looking around as if anyone could
          be listening in, and it would be a crime if they heard her voice or
          heard me speaking to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, I was disappointed that it wasn't the call I so badly wanted
          to receive—and somehow, that made me angrier.
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra, who?" I asked, feigning cluelessness.</p>
        <p><i>"The one you know," </i></p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I don't know any Zahra. Have a good day," I moved to end the
          call.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"If you end the call now, you end every chance you could ever get
            to speak to Tora Vukovic."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>The blood in my veins ran cold, and I froze.</p>
        <p>
          Tora Vukovic had been the name I'd gotten every time I'd made
          inquiries about the CIA agent my father had done close business with;
          he'd been his partner and chief, and he probably was the only person
          alive who knew what happened to my parents. But the man was a ghost; I
          had spent so much money trying to contact him, speak to him, even if
          it was a phone call.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nothing came forth, and I was beginning to get very frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>And now this fucking—</p>
        <p>
          <i>"You're still on the call; good choice,"</i> her voice remained
          hard as still, a match to how I'd answered her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flexed and unflexed my fist. "What the fuck do you want, Faizan?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Your help. And you will give it if you ever want to discover what
            happened to your parents." </i
          >She said, <i>"Are we speaking the same language?" </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I locked my jaw, swallowing hard and biting back a snare before
          speaking. "What do you need my help with?"
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><b>Zahra Faizan</b></p>
        <p><b>Sicily</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>I DROPPED </b>the phone carefully, watching the black screen as my
          fingers tapped and tapped on the table, replaying all the
          conversations in my head. I knew Dog would be the toughest nut to
          crack. That was why I didn't spare him any pleasantries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitting the nail on the head was always a perfect route to take when
          dealing with people who would rather have you buried six feet under
          than alive.
        </p>
        <p>I threw my head back and exhaled. "Fucking hell, Zahra"</p>
        <p>
          The door to <i>Maniero de Diavolo</i>'s study (Devil's Mansion: name
          credit to Martino Conti, who had thought the name a clever title for
          his mansion) opened without a knock, and Vitale strolled in, eyes
          going to the table to land on my phone. "You made the calls yet?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"And?"</p>
        <p>
          "It went very Awesome; tears were shed, alongside a lot of I love yous
          and can't wait to see yous," I said dryly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paying no mind to my sarcasm, Vitale pulled the chair opposite me and
          took his seat. "Did you call <i>him</i>?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A slight coil in my stomach tightened, and I released a breath as the
          coil danced painfully up my chest, where a new scar had made a home.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can't call him Vit. I'm not that insensitive. He will be at the
          event, so I'll...I'll speak to him then."
        </p>
        <p>Vitale nodded. "And your friends, do you think they'll show?"</p>
        <p>
          I relaxed back on the chair, lifted my shoulder, and dropped it.
          "We'll have to wait and see."

        <p>
          <b>STANDING IN </b>front of the full-length window, I watched the
          afternoon fall into the evening; the golden hour sun painted the city
          in golden yellows and orange, the color that intensified at the lit
          end of my cigar when I sucked in the smoke, letting it out and
          watching from above, how effortlessly the cars flew by.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, my life had been a series of standing, watching, waiting,
          smoking, sitting, eating, watching, reading, repeating...it was
          tiring—no matter what I did, I couldn't fill that gaping hole in my
          chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hole reminded me how much I was missing something that had once
          occupied that space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was sad half of the time—<i>most of the time</i>—if I was being
          honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lacked the zeal to do many things. I lacked drive. Passion. I was
          too empty, too...bland, and it was beginning to affect my reasoning. I
          was starting to get irritated, and when I get irritated, many people
          get affected—some worse than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to this irritation, I began seeking a change. Something different,
          something that could keep my attention, keep me interested, keep me on
          my feet and working.
        </p>
        <p>Activities.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to occupy my mind and fill up that hole one way or another.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd tried everything. I'd dipped my hands in uncomfortable things I
          would never do on a typical day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it frequenting the gym at the compound every morning? I tried
          that, but then got monotonously bored when it became a routine and
          when I needed to start getting new clothes because the ones I had were
          growing tighter than usual. One grating thing I had always tried to
          avoid was changing wardrobe. Though similar in sewing, style, and
          color, each of my clothes had its distinctive specialties, and
          changing them only because some didn't seem to fit my arms or my
          shoulders and thighs irritated me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it traveling? I tried that...I traveled to many places, not for
          work, but for sightseeing. An activity that promised wasted days and
          time, but I was desperate to fill that space. Alizea, Gran Louisa's
          doctor, suggested I accompany her on her vacation charity tour, where
          we sightsee and visit different charity homes together, helping as
          much as possible. At that point, I felt a little relieved and
          occupied. It was good to meet people and learn new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd even conceded that Angelo had been right; leaving the four walls
          of my comfort zone might be what I needed to do. I'd asked Elia to
          accompany me because I missed his company and wanted him to see new
          places with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a good time until it was over, and I was back in Milan, and
          everything kept rotating the same way it had been before I left.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I moved to painting. My therapist had advised that painting
          sometimes was the best way to express emotions we didn't know we
          carried. I got into it, researched famous artists, listened to their
          stories, tried to make it a hobby, reserved a space in my house for
          just painting, splashed and splashed different colors to see what
          emotions would be reflected in the canvas, but could find none.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, I got so angry that I destroyed almost everything in that
          room, cleaned it up, and repurchased supplies, starting the whole
          exercise from scratch. I'd only gotten scared when I had allowed my
          mind to work my hand, and every stroke from my brush began to resemble
          the face that had plastered itself to my heart with an unremovable
          glue.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had abandoned that piece and never returned to the room since
          because now, she <i>was</i> there.
        </p>
        <p>She was in my new space.</p>
        <p>She was in my new house.</p>
        <p>She was in my mind.</p>
        <p>Every damn corner of my soul, every single trail of my thoughts.</p>
        <p>It was Zahra, Zahra, Zahra, and Zahra.</p>
        <p>
          I was going mad, drowning in silence, in pretense. My heart broke
          every day with every new report I got from the people I had searching
          everywhere I knew she could and couldn't be.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been seven months since she disappeared, seven months of
          turmoil, of forced happiness, forced growth, forced everything...
        </p>
        <p>
          This woman kept killing me—with every stretch of seconds that passed,
          with her being gone, with me not knowing what state she was in, if she
          had healed, if she was angry with me, if she was even alive.
        </p>
        <p>That last thought held my throat in a chokehold every time.</p>
        <p>
          What if she had been in danger, and she had needed my help, but I
          couldn't find her, and the people who had taken her had hurt her?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was killing me, not knowing if she was okay. If she had indeed
          stayed away because she was angry and still believed I knew about the
          MCSS and lied to her face, if she hated me for almost ending her life
          the last time she saw me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, taking the cigar from my lips and blowing out a
          breath just as my phone rang.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not taking my eyes from the window, I brought out the device, dropping
          my gaze to see Angelo's name on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>I answered it before it could ring any further. "Yes?"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, hi, it's Gemma. We're about to stop at the store to get some
          stuff before we drop by for dinner. Should we get you and Elia
          anything? I've been trying to call him, but he has not been
          responding."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hold on," I said, bringing the phone down from my ear and inclining
          my head to the side a little. "Elia!" I yelled.
        </p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>I yelled his name again but got no response.</p>
        <p>
          I groaned, walked away from the window in my home office, picked up a
          small remote from the table, and pressed a button. The slide on the
          window slowly came down as I discarded the cigar, walked to the door,
          pulled it open, and yelled his name into the hallway.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was muffled, but I heard his footsteps resounding from his room
          hurriedly; something was knocked down with a thud, and a muffled curse
          reached my ear before his door opened with him rubbing his dark-rimmed
          eyes, like I'd just woke him up. "What the fuck?" he said groggily.
          "What happened?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gemma would like to know if you would want anything. She says she
          wants to get things from wherever they are right now."
        </p>
        <p>
          He yawned tiredly, falling back against his doorpost. "I don't know,
          man. I don't want anything? Maybe meds...for migraines?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I said, walking back into the home office and closing the
          door, not before hearing him curse and slamming his own door shut. "He
          says medicines for migraines."
        </p>
        <p>"Cool, and for you?"</p>
        <p>"Nothing. But if you happen to find the brand of cigar I—"</p>
        <p>
          "Bye, gotta go, love you, see you soon!" the call disconnected, and I
          sighed, settling on a chair by the side as I stared at the lit-up
          screen of my phone...the screensaver of a sleeping Zahra stared right
          back at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had taken this picture on the cruise ship a year ago after we had
          just settled a misunderstanding, and I'd gotten to experience the most
          fantastic night of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was pathetic, I was aware. Being this lost over someone I
          couldn't find.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, letting my head fall back on the chair as I
          breathed.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          I brushed my hair from my face, watching Casmiro exit the building
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the laptop's screen, I could see his frown, and in the
          background, I spotted some of our people carrying bodies to a van. "It
          was a success," he said, and the camera shifted as he entered a car.
          "There were over twenty newborns here. They're moving to the
          organization now." a soldier closed the door after him.
        </p>
        <p>"How many casualties?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Five. Four boys and a girl. We've arranged for proper rest for them,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "How did that happen?" Angelo asked from beside me, sounding
          remorseful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casmiro sighed, setting his phone so we could still see him as he
          shrugged off his coat, "Hostage situation. Those bastards gunned them
          down when they realized there was no bargaining." He answered, not
          meeting my gaze once. "We took care of them though. I'll be traveling
          back tomorrow so we can prepare for the next hit."
        </p>
        <p>
          We were baiting the MCSS. So far, we'd taken down three of their
          organizations in different countries, and they were yet to reach out
          for superior help. I knew they would soon, and I was waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it were left to me, I would obliterate the whole organization.
          There was no need for research or carefulness. I did not mind being
          careless, not when it came to this—but there was a reason why Angelo
          remained my consigliere. He looked at the situation from all angles.
          We couldn't be brash because children were involved. We had to be
          careful and save as many as possible while trying to stop the
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to bring them down in disguise as an outside body, baiting
          them to reach out to me for help. When they did, I would leave them on
          hold, until they got desperate enough to beg, then I could make them
          an offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the policies my signature had finalized, there was only so much
          that I could do, so I had to change that first. Create an opportunity
          to bring forth new policies...new leadership. I might be the overseer,
          but I did not have the kind of say I would need to put an end to the
          monstrosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          My father had been a foolish man, but he was brilliant when it came to
          doing diabolical things like this—clever when it came to ruining my
          life and making me hate my signature because though I might not have
          been a part of the whole ordeal, my signature had birthed, ruined,
          tainted, and killed and scarred so many people.
        </p>
        <p>It wasn't my fault, but at the same time, it was.</p>
        <p>
          The realization of what the MCSS was truly up to had taken a toll on
          me, Angelo, and Casmiro, whom I was sure blamed himself the hardest,
          as he authorized most shipments because I had put him in charge of
          that. He had been shocked and remorseful and actively tried to follow
          the plan without messing anything up due to his anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He and I hadn't conversed about anything outside of work. He seemed
          angry with me for a reason; it had been months now, and I hadn't had
          enough time to broach that topic with him. I also didn't want to
          push...not after I'd overheard a call he was having with his mother,
          where he told her he might permanently move his work back to Capri
          because he felt out of place and he had no family here in Milan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not feel good about his comment because he seemed to mean and
          think it. I knew it was only a matter of time before he approached me
          about him leaving the compound. He would still retain his duties and
          his position as my underboss, but we'd only meet when a severe
          situation required his physical attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew the past year had been challenging for me; I knew I had ignored
          almost everyone I held dear to me and put a strain on every
          relationship. My brothers', Gemma and Gran Louisa, Angelo, and
          Casmiro—but I was trying now, catching up; I was here, even though I
          still felt empty most of the time. I was here and present.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never intended to make him feel like he didn't belong to my
          family—or that I wanted nothing to do with him. The last personal
          conversation we'd ever had ended with me hitting him—for good
          reasons—but since then, I'd tried to include him in my private
          affairs, but he never reciprocated my efforts. He never attended the
          house opening party Angelo and his team had organized. Many associates
          were in attendance, but Casmiro never showed up. I called him, but he
          never picked up or returned the call—and we never spoke of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew then that there was little I could do to pull him back from
          whatever thought he harbored for me, little I could say to make him
          stay, but I still sat at an edge, waiting for him to finally voice out
          his plans to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was my brother and my friend; he had been there through every high
          and low with me; he had my back when I didn't have his, and I wouldn't
          blame him if he told me he had had enough.
        </p>
        <p>"They reach out yet?" he asked us.</p>
        <p>
          "No," Angelo responded, "After the next hit, they will notice a
          pattern. I know from intel they are actively seeking the people taking
          them out, but there has been no source of information yet; it's only a
          matter of time."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's a good thing." He said with a sigh, "They double by the day.
          Keeping track or leaving a dent in their numbers is hard when they
          always do replacements."
        </p>
        <p>"We will get them," I said. "You're doing a good work, Cas."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," he answered with a glance at me. "I'll call if I have anything
          new, have a good day,"
        </p>
        <p>The line disconnected, and the screen went blank.</p>
        <p>
          "Do you think we should push back a little?" Angelo asked from his
          position on the visitor's chair in my home office, "He seems
          stressed,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, getting to my feet, "No. I have a feeling he is stressed for
          a completely different reason." I answered as he got to his feet too
          and we made our way out of the office.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had arrived with Gemma about an hour ago. To my better knowledge,
          she and Elia were helping to prepare dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to Elia and I not hiring any cook, we mostly ordered, ate out, or
          had dinners like this with Gemma and Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had help come in every day to clean, and we had more than twenty
          soldiers stationed around the perimeters of the building. Though I had
          left the compound to live here, I still returned almost daily for
          in-house work. When I didn't want to go out, I worked from here.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You think something else might be going on with him?" Angelo asked
          me.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm," I said as we descended the stairs.</p>
        <p>
          "Family?" he asked again, and I gave a loud sigh to tell him I didn't
          want to talk or answer questions. "I have no one else to ask, and this
          is a big job; he's going to have to bury five children today. That
          kind of thing is bound to take a toll on anyone."
        </p>
        <p>"He volunteered."</p>
        <p>"I know, but—"</p>
        <p>
          "Angelo," I stopped when we reached the foot of the stairs, turning to
          face him. "Where is your phone?"
        </p>
        <p>He frowned, "In my pocket...why?"</p>
        <p>
          "Use it, call him, and ask him yourself since you are so concerned," I
          said, turning towards the kitchen where I heard voices.
        </p>
        <p>
          He followed after me, "I can't just pick up a phone and call him."
        </p>
        <p>"Do you have a problem with your hand?"</p>
        <p>
          "No...we are not close on a personal level. We're not friends; I can't
          call to say <i>how you holding up</i>. <i>You</i> can."
        </p>
        <p>"Not anymore," I answered.</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          I groaned, turning just before I entered the kitchen, to find a
          curious frown on his face. "Angelo, do I have to shoot you in the
          mouth before my actions paint the vivid words of—I do not want to talk
          about this—for you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His frown went from curious to irritated. "We work together. If
          there's an issue, then I have to know."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Use your phone. I don't want to hear any more of this," I said,
          entering the kitchen, digging into my pocket for my hair band, and
          ignoring his sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia was by the stove with Alizea, my house guest, until the end of
          the month. Gemma was cutting up oranges on the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alizea," I voiced, and the woman in question looked up from whatever
          she was making, "When did you return from the meeting?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She had left for her meeting early this morning. It was why she was
          here in Italy. They were testing out a new drug for cancerous
          patients—she was here to speak for it getting approved, seeing as it
          hadn't been approved at their last meeting four months ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          She said she had been trying to get it approved for three years. She
          was convinced the new medicine would save many lives, but apparently,
          people in power had another view of the matter—but one thing I'd
          always admired about her was her relentlessness. When she truly
          believed in something, she stuck her foot down and made sure no one
          stopped that thing from working the way she wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had been close friends for months now. While I had been passive
          initially when it came to her, I learned she was a good person. She
          had helped Gran Louisa, she had helped me, and I was grateful, though
          it didn't do much; I went a long way from my previous behaviors after
          Zahra's disappearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not long," she answered with a sigh, "I had to leave early because I
          promised everyone dinner," she turned back, the yellow lights from the
          top cupboard glowing on her dark skin. Her hair was styled like it had
          been when she left for the meeting this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped my hairband before Gemma, settling wordlessly on the kitchen
          stool beside her. "How was the meeting?" I asked Alizea as Gemma
          dropped the knife she had been using to cut the oranges and picked up
          my hairband, getting behind me to tie up my hair, which I'd let grow
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always liked to cut my hair; I'd never once let it grow this long
          because the length irritated me. But then I'd shot Zahra, and my hair
          was the last thing on my mind; it grew out, it irritated me, and I
          took it as a measly punishment—discomforting myself because the woman
          I loved wasn't comfortable—it made sense at that time. When she
          disappeared, I didn't even bother with it anymore.
        </p>
        <p>Gran Louisa had loved the length, Gemma too, even Alizea.</p>
        <p>
          I knew I would cut it sometime in the future, but I wanted Gran Louisa
          to be completely okay first. I'd reduce the length when I knew she was
          out of the danger zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was overruled again," Alizea said, "I presented a strong front, but
          it didn't help."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So it's not because you're a woman then," Gemma said, "Your assistant
          director looks like a guy who knows the ins and outs and could take on
          anyone with just a stare,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He tried, too. We didn't use my slides or my research; we used his,
          but they still overruled it." she sounded disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck them," Elia muttered.</p>
        <p>
          "Isn't this wasting time? This medicine could help a lot of people,
          from the way you speak of it," Angelo inquired, picking up the knife
          Gemma had dropped, and continuing the task for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning, Alizea shrugged, blowing out her breath. "I am positive we
          would be saving many lives. I have put my all into this research. My
          life, everything. Sometimes I fear I'd go back to London and my
          daughter would decide not to come home with me because she already
          believes my mother loves her more than I do,"
        </p>
        <p>I frowned, but Gemma spoke before I could.</p>
        <p>"Don't say that, I'm sure Riley understands,"</p>
        <p>"Hm. She loves you and knows you're trying to save people."</p>
        <p>
          Alizea's smile was sad, "Yeah, I guess. I worry. These other directors
          are making it all so difficult. But I have hope that they'll give
          soon. My assistant director is hell-bent on requesting forty patients
          for testing. It'll be a tight list and a big risk, but I trust my
          research."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And we trust in you," I said, "If you need help convincing them, I
          can make a call,"
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />"No, that's all right." she refused. "I need to do this on my
          own. No one will ever take me seriously if I start cutting corners
          now." She said, and I nodded in understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma finished with my hair, tying only the top half and leaving the
          rest to irritate my neck. "There you go, my love," she said before
          swiftly pushing Angelo from her previous position, "You're doing it
          wrong; it's not a perfect circle."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you need the circle for, <i>mio sole?</i> You're still going
          to squeeze out everything in it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Before you ruin them, make them beautiful," she answered softly, like
          the oranges were actually listening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo chuckled, shaking his head. "Says the lady cutting them open,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Alizea shook her head with a smile, returning to the stove as Elia
          poured the meat he had been dicing into the pan Alizea was stirring.
          "It's seasoned, hopefully, the normal amount," he told her. "I know
          jack shit about seasoning,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Alizea tasted it and nodded, "It's perfect. You know your spices,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I had a friend who liked to cook; I watched him sometimes, though he
          never knew. If he did, I would have had to pay him for learning from
          him."
        </p>
        <p>She chuckled, "Sounds like he also knew what he was doing,"</p>
        <p>"He did,"</p>
        <p>
          Elia rarely ever talked about STREET, but whenever he did, a far-off
          tone in his voice told me he missed them sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know them too well, but I felt their absence. It would feel
          worse for him, who lived with them and called them family.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got up from the stool and went behind Alizea, tucking my hands
          inside my pockets and peering over her shoulder at what she was
          stirring. "What's that brown thing?"
        </p>
        <p>"Mushrooms," she said, "You're gonna love it,"</p>
        <p>"What did you put in it?" I asked softly.</p>
        <p>
          "Some garlic, spring onions, black pepper, but not too much, and some
          ginger too,"
        </p>
        <p>"That's why it smells amazing,"</p>
        <p>
          She smiled, "My mom taught me this recipe; she always made it. It was
          my Dad's favorite, and mine too. My stepbrother didn't love it very
          much,"
        </p>
        <p>"I already love it,"</p>
        <p>She laughed, shaking her head.</p>
        <p>
          "Are you sure you do not want me to call someone?" I asked quietly
          this time.
        </p>
        <p>"I am,"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm. I know you do not like accepting help, but I promise I won't
          convince them to approve. The next meeting will be in four months. I
          can help make it happen tomorrow,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She inclined her head slightly towards me, our faces close. "That's
          still defined as cutting corners, Marino."
        </p>
        <p>"Is it?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. I know you want to help, but I truly don't need it. I can score
          this on my own. I just have to make them believe in me,"
        </p>
        <p>"It has been three years, Ali,"</p>
        <p>
          "I know how it looks, but I know I can do it. I'm not the first woman
          in medicine; I won't be the last."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, deciding to drop my offer for another time, "Okay, if you
          say so,"
        </p>
        <p>
          From my periphery, I caught Elia's eyes on us, but he quickly averted
          his stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Catching movement from my left, I turned to find Gemma and Angelo
          averting their gazes, too. I frowned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What," I asked loudly, just as Gemma's phone blared, and she fumbled
          to pick it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh look!" she yelled unnecessarily, "It's Penelope...Milk from...from
          before...you know her, she's calling now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelo dropped his head in silent laughter as Gemma picked up the
          phone from the table, fidgeting like I'd caught her stealing from my
          office.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had all gone silent when I spoke to Alizea, and I wasn't stupid
          not to notice they'd been staring at us, too.
        </p>
        <p><i>What could that be about? </i></p>
        <p>
          "Hi, Pen!" Gemma exclaimed as she awkwardly pointed to her phone as if
          to tell us it was indeed Penelope. "I'm okay, what's up?" her voice
          reduced in pitch, "What? Really? When?"
        </p>
        <p>Elia was staring now too.</p>
        <p>
          "No, I'm not home. I'm at Elio's." There was a bit of silence as she
          listened to whatever Penelope was saying—her eyes widened. "What!" she
          exclaimed again, and Angelo looked up with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemma's eyes locked with mine, but she averted her gaze quickly,
          chewing on her bottom lip...<i>She was about to lie</i>... "O...h
          no..." she said, her voice awkward. "That is so sad...the...the clown
          ate the...baby's...ice cream...cone at the park? What the hell is
          going on with the world these days?" She sighed dramatically, removing
          the phone from her ear and blocking the speaker as she backed away, "I
          have to take this call elsewhere; I can't...uh...uh...sympathize." she
          blurted the 'sympathize' "With you all...looking at me." she said, and
          then ran out of the kitchen with the phone pressed to her chest.
        </p>
        <p>"That was weird," Alizea said.</p>
        <p>
          I looked at Elia to see him grabbing his phone and rushing out of the
          kitchen with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head to the side a bit, my thoughts working, seeking,
          searching.
        </p>
        <p><i>It was...indeed...weird. </i></p>

            the dull thuds of his terrifying footstep. It was slow and fear
            intensifying. I recoiled into myself, shivering due to how fast my
            heart was racing.

            out a small breath of relief. Maybe he didn't hear my breathing,

            on his face, his eyes a piercing blue, his gloved hand gripping the

          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes snapped open, and a short gasp left my lips. My chest was
          heaving, and I was sweating, staring up at the canopy top of the bed;
          the red and black lines designing the material served its usual
          welcoming out of my nightmares.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes and tried to level my breathing. It was unsteady, and
          I felt weak—tiny in this giant bed, small in this wide room—like an
          entity blending with the dull aesthetic of the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat up and was hit by a head-spinning headache that had me wincing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning slightly to slip my hand underneath my pillow, I hoped to feel
          a flask underneath it—there was nothing there. I closed my eyes, my
          stomach turning and locking. "<i>Fuck</i>...Vitale,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I slipped out of bed with unsteady legs, my hands shaking, heart still
          racing as I dashed into the walk-in wardrobe by the side, heading
          straight for the small safe near the shoe shelves. I typed in the new
          password I installed only last night. It clicked open, and I pulled
          it, seeing the space empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, what the fuck," The emergency stainless steel hip flask I kept in
          there was gone. I slammed the safe shut and quickly shrugged off my
          nightwear, cursing Vitale and his fucking stupid intuition that fucks
          me up every time—fuck!
        </p>
        <p>
          I slipped on sweatpants and a shirt, not even bothering with a bra or
          the crazed mess of my hair. I grabbed a band and swiftly tied the
          curly bunch into a sideways ponytail...it felt uneven, so I untied it,
          discarded the band, and ran my fingers through the curls to even them
          out, but I knew my effort was shit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stepped out of the walk-in closet, my eyes finding the alarm clock
          by my bedside table. It was 2:15 in the morning. I contemplated
          grabbing my phone but decided to leave it as I walked quickly to the
          window, pulling it open slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cold air of night did nothing to make the sweat in my body any
          less irritating. I felt hot all over, inside and out.
        </p>
        <p>Nervous and anxious.</p>
        <p>
          I caught men manning every single perimeter close to my bedroom.
          Security was tight, and the mansion was shrouded with darkness as
          usual, but there was a light a few meters away from my window, and I
          would be spotted if I wasn't careful enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          A painful jolt twisted my stomach, nausea gripping me. I slammed my
          shaky hands over the window seal, trying to fight back the urge to
          vomit.
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed tightly, feeling sick.</p>
        <p>
          It had been 12 hours since I'd last had alcohol. I had sneaked a shot
          hours before, but due to Vitale being around most of the time and
          because I honestly didn't want to drink, I'd stayed away—I was fooling
          myself, however. I still kept little flasks here and there, but that
          fucking bastard always found them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as though he had signed a contract to make sure I didn't drink
          after I had a seizure months ago, and the doctor advised me to quit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It baffled me at that time because I didn't realize I had taken the
          whole drinking thing too far, but I knew it had become a coping
          mechanism over the months—I knew I had relied on it more than I should
          have.
        </p>
        <p>But then again, it was no surprise...something had changed.</p>
        <p>
          Ever since I regained consciousness after my confrontation with Elio,
          something had changed. Something had been missing, something had
          broken—I could feel it whenever I stared at the tattooed scar on my
          chest. The serpent carved into my skin curled around the bullet scar
          like it was the very thing keeping me alive.
        </p>
        <p>It might as well be.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't know what had happened, but Vitale had told me that the
          Society had saved my life. I had been in a coma for six months. In a
          limbo. Lost to the world. And I had woken up with the serpent
          tattoo-like carving around the bullet scar.
        </p>
        <p>
          He'd said I had to be smuggled out of Elio's compound, thanks to the
          help of Devil and Casmiro, who had ensured I was brought out safely
          without Elio interfering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale had been trying to convince them to help him for months. He
          knew I would die there; he knew only the secret society could save me,
          and only when Devil and Casmiro saw my condition deteriorating even
          further did they accept to help him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was pretty sure it wasn't too hard for Casmiro to decide; he did
          want me out before...As for Devil, I wasn't sure...I had broken
          STREET; we'd all basically written each other off. I wondered why he
          would want to help me after I betrayed his brother and him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't even know if I was meant to be grateful that they'd saved me
          because now Elio probably thought I ran away...but I didn't run. I was
          taken out, and I'd stayed away after I woke up because I was scared of
          going back...seeing what he thought of me, seeing the look he would
          give me because I was so confident—so confident that he had checked
          the contents in that flash drive.
        </p>
        <p>If he had, then I didn't know how I could face him.</p>
        <p>I was embarrassed.</p>
        <p>
          The minute I woke up, I wanted nothing more but to reach out to him,
          but I'd recoiled; I'd thought hard about it—the time and distance
          between us, my flash drive still in his possession. I couldn't bring
          myself to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was tired now...I wanted to set things right. We'd promised each
          other we'd stop those fuckers together. I'd fucked that up because I
          was insecure. I fucked up my relationship with STREET because I
          thought it was the right way—but I had been wrong.
        </p>
        <p>Very fucking wrong.</p>
        <p>
          I was withering. I was unstable, and I needed familiarity. I needed to
          put a stop to these nightmares, needed to go back to normal—<i
            >feel</i
          >
          normal.
        </p>
        <p>I needed my family with me when I stopped these bastards.</p>
        <p>I needed Elio with me.</p>
        <p>I needed STREET.</p>
        <p>
          Pushing them away hadn't been how I'd thought it would be. I'd never
          considered the fact that I could confide in them. I could tell them,
          though they might see me differently, but I would have allowed them
          the decision to leave or stay. I didn't have to make that choice for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had taken risks that day. I had taken enormous risks that ruined
          everything I loved—if there was even a sliver of chance I could change
          that? Fix up my shit? Then I'd do it.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe then I wouldn't feel so empty.</p>
        <p>So lost. So alone.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't know who to blame but myself. I caused this, caused
          everything that happened to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another urge to vomit hit me, and I bit my teeth hard, knowing there
          wouldn't be anything to vomit; I'd probably just dry heave and cause
          strain to my stomach muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did this to myself. I had wanted to escape from this hollow feeling
          so bad that I got myself addicted without even realizing it was an
          addiction.
        </p>
        <p>Fucking careless.</p>
        <p>
          I pushed back from the window and walked to the dressing table, opened
          the last drawer, took out my silencer, grabbed some small squeezed-up
          change and a few quarters, and slipped the silence behind my sweat
          pants, tucking the money into my pockets without checking to see how
          much I had gathered before moving back to the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefully, I climbed out the window, cautiously pausing a little to
          blend into the night in their periphery. When I was certain I could
          move, I walked sideways to the other corner back of the house, where I
          knew I could cut my way into the heavy bushes surrounding the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had stashed a bicycle in the woods—it wasn't the first time I had
          used it, and I knew I wasn't helping matters by relapsing like this,
          but damn it to hell, I couldn't help it. It wasn't easy. I craved the
          way I felt when I took alcohol than the way I felt without it.
        </p>
        <p>I needed it. I needed alcohol to feel more like myself.</p>
        <p>
          It wasn't too hard putting up a strong front when it came to leading,
          especially when I had liquid courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale had never approved of it, and I wouldn't blame him. He was
          often left to clean up my messes, though he had much work cut out for
          him. Now that he led the Conti secret society, he had three months to
          prove himself ready. I wasn't much help to him; the ring on my finger
          did more than I could, and well—the money in my bank account. I held
          the highest share in society and was required to attend most meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't like me but respected and loved my money. It was a
          win-win-<i>win</i>situation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I maneuvered into the thick woods after finding my way down the
          building without breaking any bones. It took me longer to get through
          because I couldn't feel half of anything around me but the painful
          need to consume alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>
          I unsteadily got on the bicycle and rode my way through the woods,
          down the lane leading to the highway where I knew the 24/7 convenience
          store was. I hadn't been there for two months because I always managed
          to stash the flasks where Vitale would miss them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me about twenty minutes to get there, and I got off the bike,
          stumbling my way inside the store, not caring that I'd discarded the
          bicycle carelessly on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made my way toward the aisle where alcohol was sold, and with my
          eyes zooming in and out of focus, I trailed my fingers on the surface
          of the bottles, looking for the one capable of removing this feeling
          in only a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>I found one...</p>
        <p>Vodka. Small sized.</p>
        <p>
          I picked it out of the shelf and checked the alcohol percentage. It
          was perfect. I was about to leave, but then I turned and grabbed
          another bottle—you know, just in case.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked to the counter, grabbed a can of beer from the side, and
          dropped everything before finally looking at the man standing there—he
          was new.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a hipster beard and a frohawk on his head. A small radio by his
          side played a static rock song as he watched me warily. He was judging
          me. I probably looked like shit.
        </p>
        <p>Not probably. <i>I looked like shit. </i></p>
        <p>
          Digging my hands into both my pockets, I brought out the change I had
          squeezed in, fishing out the coins and dropping everything on the
          counter as I sniffed, basically bouncing on my feet as I looked back
          at him.
        </p>
        <p>"Can I see some ID?" He asked, voice gruff.</p>
        <p>I frowned. "Why?"</p>
        <p>"You don't look old enough to get these,"</p>
        <p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p>
        <p>His stare was blank. He didn't respond.</p>
        <p>
          "It's the middle of the fucking night; you don't think my fucking
          parents would know if I snuck out to get booze at two fucking am,"
        </p>
        <p>"Adults don't say booze," he clarified, and my left eye twitched.</p>
        <p>
          "Booze is a word, frohawk...it doesn't have some kind of age limit. I
          say booze; you just said booze, everybody, and their fucking grandma
          says booze!"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah...no."</p>
        <p>
          I groaned. "Listen here, motherfucker; I am not in the right state of
          mind to argue with you, just count this shit up and let me be on my
          way,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the money on the counter, scoffing as he met my gaze
          again. "That won't even cover the beer. Another proof that you're
          underage,"
        </p>
        <p>This—</p>
        <p>I reached behind me and pulled out my gun.</p>
        <p>
          "The fuck?" he backed up, almost knocking down a crate behind him,
          fear flashing in his eyes as he raised both hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I inclined the gun to him with my head gesturing to the items on the
          table, "Pack it up," I said, grabbing the money I had placed on the
          counter and shoving it back in my pocket, "Now you don't even get the
          fucking change,"
        </p>
        <p>"The—"</p>
        <p>"I'll shoot you and pack it up myself if you don't comply,"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, okay, relax," he said, eyes on the gun as he hurriedly started
          parking the items. I looked around the store, stepped back, grabbed a
          bag of chips, and dropped it on the counter.
        </p>
        <p>"Pack that too,"</p>
        <p>"Come on, man, I gotta account for that shit?"</p>
        <p>
          "The chips or your life, which do you value?" I asked, and he
          hesitantly did as instructed with fear and discomfort in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he was all done, I picked up the bag he had packed and smiled at
          him. "If I'm feeling generous, I'll send someone over tomorrow; if I'm
          not...you've got much explaining to do with your boss,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He still had his hands up as I made my way out of the store, tucking
          the bag under my arm as I slipped the gun back behind me. I saw him
          reach for his phone through the transparent doors. I ignored him, got
          on the bicycle, and drove away from the store and further up the
          highway away from the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only stopped in a corner, where a narrow road was paved, still
          surrounded by bushes, but there was pavement on each side and a small
          cabin right opposite me; the lights were on there, giving me enough
          courage to sit down because there was a sign of life around, even if
          it was dead silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got off the bicycle, letting it fall without much care as I settled
          on the ground, resting my back against the pole of a posted sign and
          pulling out the canned beer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chugged that down first without pause, sighing as the slightly
          bitter taste swirled around my tongue, my muscles relaxing, the pace
          at which my heart had been beating slowed down, and my eyes stung at
          how fucking pathetic I had become.
        </p>
        <p>Reliant on alcohol to feel sane.</p>
        <p>
          I'd never truly understood why Elio called me careless until I'd found
          myself in a hospital with strict warnings from the doctor to stay away
          from what I was currently consuming.
        </p>
        <p>If anyone from STREET saw me now, I would be ridiculed.</p>
        <p>
          I could barely look myself in the mirror these days; I was more bone
          than skin. I hated it. Hated what I'd become since I woke up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wiped my cheek with the back of my hand, squeezing the beer can and
          throwing it to the side before grabbing a bottle of vodka, opening it,
          and drinking from it. I drank until my hands were no longer shaking,
          drank until my headache subsided, and drank till all the sweat and
          nausea left me. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          My limbs were now relaxed; I felt the alcohol sweep through my body,
          taking me from half-conscious to high in a matter of minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downing everything in the first bottle, I entered into the second
          bottle, opening and drinking from that too.
        </p>
        <p>I was killing myself—but I was also doing the right thing.</p>
        <p>
          It felt like I was dying only moments ago, but this feeling was much
          better than the other one...I knew that. And this was me helping
          myself...
        </p>
        <p>
          This was...this was necessary...I wasn't weak...being able to do this
          wasn't...wasn't me being weak...it meant that I was strong because
          while knowing this was worsening my condition, I knew it was best.
        </p>
        <p>This was best.</p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes and let my head drop on the pole, biting my bottom
          lip hard to keep my eyes from tearing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moments like this were when I thought about <i>him</i> the hardest. If
          I closed my eyes, I could picture his; if I went silent, I could hear
          his voice. So familiar, deep, and accented. I wouldn't even need to
          overthink before I felt the warmth of his touch on my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd lost count of the times I'd dreamt of him—the few times I didn't
          have nightmares, he was my relief. I would fight fiercely to stay in
          that dream. And even when I woke up, I would try to replay the
          scenario in my head: his beautiful gray eyes, his small, subtle smile,
          his hands on mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          God—I'd lost count of the times I'd touched myself to him. He was ever
          present in my memories, never fading. I loved it. It made me eager to
          see him again...and fuck, when I do see him again...
        </p>
        <p>
          I would apologize, assure him that the ring on my finger didn't mean
          anything because I knew how much he liked to overthink things; I'd
          assure him that he was the only one I wanted, the only one I saw in
          the sea of many. I would hug him and possibly cry and beg him to help
          me stop my addiction because if there was anyone who knew how to stop
          a habit or...manage it? It was him.
        </p>
        <p>The man I loved.</p>
        <p>The man I had never gotten to confess to.</p>
        <p>I wondered what he would think if he saw me now—</p>
        <p><i>Meow.</i></p>
        <p>My eyes snapped open as the tiny sound came again.</p>
        <p>
          Slowly, I turned my head, seeing a cat walking towards me, hopping on
          one foot, eyes wide, black as night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted slightly, my movement sluggish, "Stay back," I said, but it
          sounded like 'staaaaay back.'
        </p>
        <p>Almost like the cat heard me, it stopped and watched me silently.</p>
        <p>I scrunched my nose.</p>
        <p>
          "Shoo," I moved my hand, flaying my fingers weakly at it. But it
          didn't move, "Go away, shoo away, leave me the fuck alone."
        </p>
        <p>It still watched me.</p>
        <p>
          I hardened my stare at it. "I have a silencer; it's—it's quick, one
          pew, and you're fucking dead...you wanna die?"
        </p>
        <p><i>Meow.</i></p>
        <p>
          "What do you want? Food? I don't have a—" I stopped, my gaze dropping
          on the bag, remembering I'd stolen a bag of chips with the drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sluggishly reached for it, dropping the half-empty bottle of vodka
          as I opened the bag of chips, staring at its content and immediately
          losing interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at the cat. "I guess you can have it," I said, dumping all
          the content on the ground. The animal didn't waste time as it ate
          without looking up once, "Look at you...poor thing," I whispered,
          "Broken like me..." I blinked, but it was slow, "What was it? A car
          hit you? Try comparing that to a fucking bullet."
        </p>
        <p>It didn't respond.</p>
        <p>I shifted further away.</p>
        <p>
          "You know...I get it," I said, watching the cat eat. "Sometimes I ask
          myself...or more like...say to myself." I hiccupped. "Who the
          fuck...fights for a gun...my best friend, Dog...not like... an actual
          dog, but like, his name used to be Dog—he would call me stupid
          because, fighting for a gun...that shit never ends well in movies, I
          should have known. Now, I'm just—purposeless. I do...have a
          purpose...I called everybody for the purpose, but...but I'm talking
          like—personal purpose? You get it? I have..." I hiccupped again,
          looking at my palms to find the purpose, "I have none...empty
          vessel..." I laughed, "And to think I'm at the top...the top of the
          food chain...karma's a bitch," the cat turned and started walking
          away, "and you're an ungrateful piece of shit," I yelled after it as
          it hopped into the woods faster than it had been walking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I groaned, realizing I'd just been talking to a cat and then laughing
          because, well—I'd just been talking to a cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck my life," I said to myself, grabbing the bottle beside me and
          chugging down the rest of its content before discarding it and
          stumbling to my feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground moved underneath my feet, and I wobbled, trying and failing
          to clear my vision. My head felt light, and every heavy worry I
          carried felt paper-weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grumbled, picking up the bicycle and getting on it without any
          mind—I didn't even paddle far before I crashed into the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fucking hell—" I groaned, taking my wrist from the ground. Wincing at
          the pain, I squeezed my eyes shut, hugging my hand to my chest, the
          gun pressing into my back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know how long I lay there, but I knew it was long before I
          disentangled my legs from the bicycle and got to my feet, deciding to
          walk back down, leaving the bicycle because it hurt me, and because it
          was stupid to ride in this state.
        </p>
        <p>
          My feet crisscrossed as I walked down—regretting not carrying my
          phone. I knew the time would be almost 3-to-4 Am now, telling from how
          the night had gone very cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I threw my head back, looking up at the sky and then back to the empty
          road ahead, my hair flying lightly around. I didn't bother to remove
          it from my face—whenever I did that, I was reminded of the time Elio
          had helped tie it up, telling me to always keep myself in order before
          meeting him. He couldn't help the urge to fix things, he had said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well—good for him; I was a mess now and knew only he could fix me.
        </p>
        <p>I hoped it wouldn't seem as though I was asking too much.</p>
        <p>It wasn't too much...</p>
        <p>
          If he still loved me...loved me like I loved him, if the feelings I
          harbored for him were remotely close to what he felt for me, then he
          would help me...he would hold me...and kiss me, like no time had
          passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Headlights shone from behind me, and I turned while still walking
          forward. I placed my hand over my eyes to shield myself from the harsh
          glare of the light.
        </p>
        <p>It was a car, and it was slowing down as it reached me.</p>
        <p>I looked away, walking forward.</p>
        <p>
          The person honked, and I shook my head, waving them off. "No...nope,
          just drive..." I mumbled, and they followed me, honking still.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept walking forward until it was parking before me, killing off
          their engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hesitantly stopped walking, looking towards the car as the person
          came down from it. It was a <i>guy</i>—He looked my age, with blonde
          hair and blue eyes, wearing a faded jean jacket. He slammed the door
          of the car beside him. "Need any help?" he asked, walking towards me.
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head, "No, thanks."</p>
        <p>
          Then he looked around and back to me as I stood unsteady on my feet
          because the world was spinning.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You sure? You seem a little out of it, it's the middle of the night,
          I can drive you home,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head again as he came closer. "Please stay back...I'm...I'm
          good...my house isn't far from here,"
        </p>
        <p>"I only wanna help,"</p>
        <p>
          "I said I'm good," I answered, sidestepping him and stumbling; his
          arms came around my front, keeping me steady and—closer to him. "No,
          please don't touch me...trust me, you don't want to touch me,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I just wanna help. Come on, let's get in my car," he began pulling me
          toward his car, and thank you, alcohol, because while I tried to get
          out of his hold, he was stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Listen, Justin Bieber, I don't wanna hurt you," I drawled out,
          probably sounding pathetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          And look there, he even laughed, "I don't think you're in the position
          to hurt anyone, beautiful."
        </p>
        <p>"Wrong...I have a...I have a gun behind me,"</p>
        <p>
          I think I caught him raising a brow, and then I felt his hand on my
          ass, then up and up until he felt the gun and pulled it out, bringing
          it to his view. "What the fuck?"
        </p>
        <p>"Cool, right? It's a silencer, pretty...pretty swift."</p>
        <p>"Where the fuck did you get this?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Uh...my dressing table? In the last drawer, I keep guns
          there...well...normal guns, but not the one I want. Elio's gun...I
          can't find it, I don't know where it is...maybe that's why I don't
          sleep well at night," I mumbled out rubbish, unsure of when my body
          went against the guy's car.
        </p>
        <p>
          He pinned me there with his hand on my shoulder, as he studied the
          gun, "This is some cool shit," he said and then slipped it behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, come on, give it back, that gun cost an arm and a fucking leg," I
          hiccupped, "I'm the thief...you don't...you don't steal from a
          thief...that's fucked up,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "God, you're wasted," he said with a crooked smile, "Beatrice turned
          me down tonight, but you will have to do,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I snorted out a laugh, "There's fucking vegetable stuck to your teeth,
          and your breath smells like fish...I say Beatrice made the wise choice
          tonight."
        </p>
        <p>He pressed into me, "Shut the fuck up,"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I breathed, "Okay, let's relax...okay?" I said. "Trust me, the
          pussy is drier than a Sahara right now; you're gonna have a shit time
          with me...and you'd probably die before you even try..." I hiccupped,
          "For your own good...you should...you should leave me alone,"
        </p>
        <p>He scoffed, "I can make you wet, you'll like it,"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah...I...I kind of doubt that, but that's not my point...you see, I
          have a fiancé, and he's pretty crazy, you know? Like...he's fucking
          crazy. Bat shit. Like he has a pet crow crazy, he'll murder you if you
          try to stick your dick in me, you don't want him to murder you. His
          murdering is...is very murdering."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't see anyone around you, beautiful; it's only us here."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, just...give it a minute, he'll be—" The distant sound of a
          motorcycle racing towards us met my ears, and the single headlight
          came into view, "I wonder how he is always on time...I swear it's
          fucking voodoo,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Blondie's hand loosened from me as Vitale's bike slowed when he
          reached us.
        </p>
        <p>The headlight turned off.</p>
        <p>And...</p>
        <p>
          With a leather jacket, matte black helmet, leather gloves crafted
          perfectly for his hands, black jeans, and over-the-top expensive black
          boots on his feet, my knight in shining armor blended well with the
          night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him open his visor, watching the scene as he got off the
          bike and removed his helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          A frown lined his brows, bright blue but angry gaze settling firmly on
          blondie.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Welp," I hiccupped, "now you're screwed, Justin Bieber,"

        <p>Hi again!</p>
        <p>
          I finished my priority project. Now I'm back to revising Elio Marino
          for publishing. Although, my break has started because I've been
          writing all through this year, which can cause major burnouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But If you know me, you know there's one story that always makes me
          break self-rules, and that's this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might be on break...but! Only you have the power to get me rising
          with sparkles from the trenches to write the next chapter for you
          guys! *think Winx Club power transition clips, yeah, that's how I rose
          to write this* Flatter and bless and sweep me away with your comments.
          Actually, I'm really serious this time, your comments are literally
          what produced this one. So don't hide your thoughts!

        <p>
          <b>IT WAS</b> pretty easy to take advantage of a situation when the
          victim is left distracted by the sudden change of events, so when I
          slipped my hand behind Justin Bieber's pants, I pulled out my gun,
          jammed it at the back of his head the same time my knees slammed
          behind his. He jerkily fell on his knees to the ground with a sharp
          grunt, his hand flying to the back of his head as if to hold the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blew a breath at my freedom from his hold, stumbling away from
          Blondie as Vitale approached us, eyes roaming up and down my frame
          before he focused on the guy on the ground again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's a bad guy," I slurred out, "Said he wanted to <i>woohoo</i> with
          me," I hiccupped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale glanced at me, irritation lining his stare, and I shrugged,
          unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hated seeing me this way, hated hearing me speak this way—he could
          as well get in line because I hated it too, and he knew shit about
          what I was going through or the demons I had buried inside my head,
          crawling back up to the surface with each day that passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched his gloved hand rest atop the guy's head as he not so gently
          snapped his head up by his short blonde hair. "Your name?" Vitale
          questioned, the frown still on his face.
        </p>
        <p>"Jer—"</p>
        <p>
          "Jerome, you're gonna get in your car," he said, "Erase this night
          from your memories, erase the face of that woman from your unconscious
          dreams, and drive away."
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't see Blondie's face, but I knew he was glaring and was wise
          enough not to say anything dumb.
        </p>
        <p>"Respond so I know I'm understood, Jesper,"</p>
        <p>"I wasn't gonna do anything to her; I only wanted to help."</p>
        <p>
          I gasped, rushing to stand by Vitale's side to see the glare on
          Blondie's face, "You motherfucking liar. You said I—"
        </p>
        <p>Vitale's head snapped toward me with a firm glare. "Step away,"</p>
        <p>"The fucker's lying, he should die,"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Faizan, go around killing everyone who looks at you the wrong
          way; that is very healthy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to the Bieber guy in time to see something flash in his eyes
          as he looked at the gun in my hand, then my eyes, over to Vitale and
          his bike, almost as if registering his situation. Looking back at
          Vitale, he gulped down.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met Vitale's stare again. "He didn't only look at me wrongly, he
          touched me wrongly,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Listen, man, I don't want any trouble, okay? I was heading out of
          town back to school 'cause my girlfriend was in some shit mood, and
          then I saw this chick by the side of the road—she was hot, drunk, and
          I, fuck—tell me you get it, man,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched a questioning frown crawl onto Vitale's face as he and I
          slowly looked back at Blondie, who probably just realized he had said
          the wrong thing.
        </p>
        <p>Vitale nodded slowly, "Yeah...yeah, I get it, man,"</p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, I was blankly watching the back headlights of
          Blondie's car sinking into the water and flickering off as it
          disappeared, followed by a low groaning sound coming from the drowning
          vehicle, bubbles erupting from the surface of the deep lake, a little
          distance from <i>Maniero de Diavolo.</i>
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, looking over at Vitale, who stood watching beside me.</p>
        <p>"What an odd guy, am I right?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          Vitale glanced at me, and he shook his head in displeasure before
          turning and walking away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed behind him with my unsteady footsteps. "That's it?" I said,
          "No scolding? No...oh Zahra, you fucked up, blah blah, you should know
          better, blah blah, you shouldn't be this way, blah blah blah,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I caught his shoulder tensing as we walked the path to the mansion,
          but he remained quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, ignoring me, it is," I mumbled with a tired sigh, followed by a
          tired yawn. I had enough adventure for one night. The alcohol wasn't
          wearing off, and I liked it—sort of, everything was happening in a
          haze. It felt as though nothing really mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale's glare and quietness, the blondie trying to take advantage of
          me, the minor crime Vitale and I had just committed, my withering mind
          and every longing tugging at my insides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the ache in my heart had dulled; it was there—but it seemed as
          though it wasn't as serious as I once thought.
        </p>
        <p>This feeling could be compared to floating.</p>
        <p>
          Floating away from the horrors that waited on the ground below,
          horrors that screamed and roared, raising their multiple hands to
          catch me and drag me back down so they could swallow me whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, I struggled to understand why I hadn't done this sooner,
          why I had denied myself the relief that came with drinking. The peace
          of mind that it offered even for a couple of hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew the fog would clear when I woke up feeling like a zombie and a
          miserable human being who needed to undo all that had happened
          tonight—except the part with the Bumble version of Justin Bieber.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took almost twenty minutes to reach the mansion and five to reach
          my room, ignoring the security watching as I walked in and Vitale's
          voice asking for names of the guys in charge of securing the area
          tonight for having missed me escaping the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Escaping</i>...I scoffed as I stumbled into my room, Vitale hot on
          my heel. I could feel his anger, even as I twisted and turned to look
          at him, "Get the fuck out,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm standing right here until I'm certain you're asleep and won't get
          up till it's daybreak,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Anger coiled in my insides. "I'm not your fucking prisoner, Vitale;
          step the fuck out, or I'll make sure you never step foot in this
          building ever again,"
        </p>
        <p>"Try that, and see what I fight back with."</p>
        <p>
          My jaw clenched, and I sharply turned towards the dressing room,
          walking in, about to lift my shirt, when I saw that he had followed me
          there. "Are you serious?"
        </p>
        <p>He shrugged, "I'm not taking my eyes off you,"</p>
        <p>"I want to change, fucking leave,"</p>
        <p>
          "You can change," Icy blue eyes raked down and up my form, as he
          crossed his arms against his chest, leaning on the doorpost, legs
          crossed at the ankles as he finished his statement with, "Nothing I
          haven't seen before,"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, when we were fucking teenagers,"</p>
        <p>"You're still the same,"</p>
        <p>"Fuck you, Vitale,"</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck you, Zahra, I'm standing right here, and there's nothing you can
          do about it." There was a challenge in his eyes that I had no strength
          to entertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no way in hell I was changing in front of him. Not because I
          was shy but because my body belonged to me and a certain man living in
          Milan, Italy.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm too drunk for this shit,"</p>
        <p>"Yeah, you are, you always are,"</p>
        <p>
          "If you have something to say, just fucking say it and get off my ass
          about it,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Still holding that indifferent stare, he said, "You clearly enjoy
          being pathetic; why the fuck should I keep telling you <i>why</i> you
          shouldn't be pathetic,"
        </p>
        <p>Disbelief clouded my rational thoughts, "I enjoy being pathetic?"</p>
        <p>
          <br />"Yeah, why else would you sneak out of your own house like a
          thief to consume cheap vodka by the side of the fucking road like some
          road junkie,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed the lump in my throat, watching the indifference in his
          eyes grow to disappointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          My breathing grew uneven, and I looked away from him. "Judge me all
          you want; I know more than anyone that my behavior isn't normal."
        </p>
        <p>"Do you?"</p>
        <p>
          My gaze snapped to his, "I do," I couldn't hide the sharpness in my
          voice, the embarrassment in my bones, and the burn in my eyes. "I see
          what you see in me now, Vitale, and I fucking hate it. I don't want
          it. I don't even have time for it because we have shit to do, but I
          cannot—" I swallowed, "I cannot help it, okay, I have—I have tried to
          control it and be stronger but, but it's not working Vitale, I'm
          fucked." A beat passed, and I said the words I hadn't said out loud to
          myself since I started feeling it. "I fucked up real bad this time,"
        </p>
        <p>I felt a tear fall from my eyes, but I quickly wiped it off.</p>
        <p>
          The disappointment in his eyes grew into what looked like pity or
          concern—I couldn't break it down because my head wasn't on straight.
        </p>
        <p>I felt wrong.</p>
        <p>Silence stretched between us as I leaned back against a dresser.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm trying to help you," he spoke softly, "I'm doing all I can to
          help you, Zahra, but you keep undoing it,"
        </p>
        <p>"You don't understand—"</p>
        <p>
          "I understand. It's addiction. It only goes two ways, you choose to
          fucking help yourself, or you don't."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, jittery fingers running through my tangled curls.
          "You still don't get it,"
        </p>
        <p>"What don't I get, Faizan?"</p>
        <p>
          "Everything!" I looked at him, seeing the truth lingering in his eyes,
          "This...<i>me</i>...here with you right now...it's fucking wrong,
          Vitale."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not—"</p>
        <p>
          "I should be dead. I shouldn't be here; whatever the fuck you and
          those fuckers did to me, it's fucking with me. I don't feel," I
          breathed out the chaos in my head, "I don't feel right, Vitale, ever
          since I woke up, it's...it's all just wrong. I can't control shit; I
          can't stop fucking myself up. That's not me. I can't even sit through
          one meal. I look like <i>her</i>...like the me that I grew from. My
          nightmares are back, and I see him every time. The same fucking dream
          every night,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, leaving his position as he walked to stand in front of me,
          "Zahra, there is nothing wrong with you,"
        </p>
        <p>"You clearly don't see me,"</p>
        <p>
          "I see you," he responded almost immediately, holding my gaze. "I see
          you more than you know. The society...all we did was help, nothing
          more. I was with you every damn second of the day, no one tried shit.
          Yes, you would feel some side effects, the nightmares, but they'll
          leave. Your mind is vulnerable; you have to pick yourself up. The
          drinking, your past...those things aren't making you move,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Drinking, I understand," I said with a nod and then shook my head,
          "But you can't expect me to forget everything. Everyone I care
          about—they hate me, V, I don't know how to live with that thought."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "Two weeks, Vitale. It has been two weeks since I reached out, and no
          one called back; no one showed up. It fucking hurts, I can't deal with
          it sober, I—I feel so alone,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He held my shoulders, shaking me slightly. "For fucks sake, Zahra,
          you're not alone."
        </p>
        <p>"You don't—"</p>
        <p>
          "None of the people you care about are here. None of them
          <i>were</i> here when you fought to breathe every day. I was there. I
          <i>am</i> here now, standing right fucking in front of you." his eyes
          held a heavy stare, and his voice sounded pained. "How visible do I
          need to be for you to see me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My throat clogged, and I felt guilt crawling up my spine, feeling like
          shit for always forgetting he was there. It was easy to forget. He
          blended too well with my background, too well with me. I was royally
          screwing things over between us, but I couldn't help it; he wasn't
          enough to fill up this gaping space inside me. "I'm sorry." I
          whispered with a groan, "I know you're here, I—you're family—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck that," he said, his hands dropping from my shoulders, "Fuck
          family, Zahra, I'm more than that."
        </p>
        <p>"Vitale, this isn't—"</p>
        <p>
          "I'll leave you." He said, voice tainted with defeat, and I hated the
          relief I felt upon hearing it. "Just promise me you'll go to bed and
          not pull shit because I swear to God—"
        </p>
        <p>"I promise...I'll behave,"</p>
        <p>
          He nodded. "Yeah," he looked away from me, already moving to the door,
          but I reached for his wrist, holding him back from leaving and
          watching the glistening of the identical ring on his finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, moving to stand before him, watching his expectant eyes on
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rising to my toes, I wrapped my arms around him in a hug, "Thank you,"
          I said softly, feeling the fast pacing of his heart, wishing he would
          stop feeling this way for me because I knew I could never reciprocate
          his feelings. "Thank you for being here, V. I don't say it enough, but
          I truly appreciate you for being here even when you don't have any
          obligation to be,"
        </p>
        <p>
          It was tentative and hesitant, but his arms softly came around me.
          "It's what we do, Faizan. It's what we've always done," he pressed a
          kiss to the side of my head as he pulled away softly, "Try to get some
          sleep; I'll find you when it's daytime."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded with a close-lipped smile as I watched him pull away entirely
          before leaving the dressing room.
        </p>
        <p>
          When my bedroom door closed, I threw my head back and breathed before
          turning to the mirror to watch my reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked miserable and wondered how Vitale had indeed seen me. I
          lifted my shirt over my head, and my gaze fell to the serpent tattoo
          on my chest, lingering before I raised my attention to the tattoo on
          my shoulder. Elio's initials standing ever proud.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, bending a little to open a drawer and retrieve a black
          box before standing upright with my thigh pushing the drawer close.
        </p>
        <p>
          My finger caressed the small box before I softly opened it and sighed
          in relief when I caught the butterfly necklace lying there peacefully,
          away from the turmoil its owner was facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised it to my view, dropping the empty box before undoing the hook
          on the necklace and wearing it around my neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silently, I stroked the butterfly pendant, remembering the first time
          Elio placed it around my neck. I had loved it more than I should have.
          I didn't even like butterflies...or had a special connection to them,
          but Elio created something that day. I'd never been so in love with an
          object. I had felt special...so special.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, watching the necklace lying on my neck, just above the serpent
          tattoo between my breasts, I had never felt loss so fierce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loss of what could have been, what I could have had if I had just been
          trusting enough, if I had let go sooner, if I hadn't made a mistake
          that cost me everything I cared about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at my reflection, my eyes staring deep into my tear-brimmed
          eyes, a twitching snare on my cheek as I spoke with so much hate.
          "Fuck you, Zahra." I gulped down, "<i>Fuck you</i>, you fucking
          <i>stupid</i> egotistical bitch, <i>fuck</i> you."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked away from my reflection, from the hate simmering inside me as
          I shrugged out of my sweatpants and redressed in my nightwear before
          walking back to the cold room, getting atop the too-large bed and
          staring emptily at the canopy top of the bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          My muscles didn't relax, neither did I feel comfortable enough to sink
          into the pillows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know how long I lay there for. How long my mind was thinking
          every thought but no thought at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhausted, I looked to my left and dragged my body towards the edge of
          the bed, reaching for my phone on the wooden table by the side before
          lying back on the pillows properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screen lit up, and a familiar picture of Dog and me on the cruise
          by a poolside met my view.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took the selfie, and I was pressed to his side, my grin so wide my
          eyes seemed almost closed. His smile was equally wide, but he had a
          more reserved look with his eyes wide and his slightly wet hair pushed
          back by sunglasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had taken this photo a few minutes before Devil had gotten a call
          from Elio, and we had all rushed to his suite to help him get better.
        </p>
        <p>Elio...</p>
        <p>
          I navigated my phone to my contact list, clicking on the favorites
          tab, and only his contact came up.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was almost five am. Knowing Elio, he was probably awake...maybe
          reading a book or trying to find sleep like I was doing now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't thinking when I clicked on his name, placing a call to him.
          My heart quickly climbed up my throat as I curled in bed, hugging
          myself as it rang.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, savoring the dull ringing, knowing he wouldn't pick
          up. It was an unknown number, and he was not a huge fan of calls or
          text messages, even from people he knew—but that didn't stop me from
          gaining a little comfort in hearing the ringing until it disconnected
          because, as expected, he didn't pick up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, pulling the covers up my body and settling deeper into
          the pillows as I clicked on his name again, pressing the phone to my
          ear, determined to do it until I found sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          It rang until it disconnected, and I called back, feeling tears gather
          around my closed eyelids, before dropping down the bridge of my nose
          to the side of the pillow as the call disconnected again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I returned it, soaking into the dull monotone sound, almost like it
          was connecting me in a thousand ways to him—the one person I longed to
          see the most. The tightening in my chest locked on, strung along until
          it felt like I couldn't breathe.
        </p>
        <p>It disconnected. I returned it.</p>
        <p>
          Tiredness and hurt were crushing me whole, and I was falling into a
          drowsiness that had me getting even more comfortable—
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hello." </i></p>
        <p>I froze.</p>
        <p>My heart. My tears. Everything halted.</p>
        <p>
          A slight shuffle was heard from the other end of the line; he was
          breathing—he just let out a long, tired breath and—
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hello."</i></p>
        <p>
          Again. His voice. Groggy. Sleepy. It made my heart hammer; it made me
          forget to hide my breathing; I caved even more when that deep timbre
          came again, sounding more questioning. <i></i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"Hello?" </i></p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, falling into that sound, letting it swirl around my
          brain, sink into my veins, and blend perfectly with my bloodstream.
        </p>
        <p>I missed it so much. I missed that voice so much.</p>
        <p>
          Longing tugged at my heart. Longing and love, so much love that I
          couldn't help but smile at a tiny fact in all of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been sleeping. He <i>was</i> sleeping. That meant he was doing
          okay. He was doing better mentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me a minute to realize my breathing was the only thing I could
          hear now.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his end, there was nothing. No breathing. Just a deafening
          silence, a silence that locked up every muscle on my body. He hadn't
          disconnected the call; I still felt him at the other end of the line.
          He hadn't gone back to sleep either. He—
        </p>
        <p><i>"Zahra?" </i></p>
        <p>
          I snatched the phone from my ear and ended the call with unsteady
          fingers, my heart thundering away in my chest as I sat upright. My
          thoughts clearer than they had been before I decided to call him.
        </p>
        <p>Fuck.</p>
        <p>Shit.</p>
        <p>Fucking shit.</p>
        <p>
          The hope in his voice. The change in his tone. All traces of sleep had
          been decimated from him. I wondered what that meant—didn't he check
          the flash drive? Didn't he hate me for leaving? Was he looking for me?
          Why did I hear the heavy hope in his voice? What—
        </p>
        <p>
          My phone vibrated in my hands, and my eyes widened when I saw his name
          flashing on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh fucking hell, Zahra," I groaned to myself, realizing that I had
          forgotten to private my fucking number.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched it ring, my palms sweaty with nerves. The strong urge to
          answer made my fingers twitch violently. I felt so bad sitting there
          watching the phone ring and ring and ring until it disconnected.
        </p>
        <p>
          My shaking fingers went to his contact setting, quickly blocking the
          number before he could call again.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I successfully blocked it, guilt washed my vision into blurs,
          knowing how I must have ruined his sleep and his mind with that one
          stupid action.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let my body fall back on the bed, wiping my cheeks and whispering
          out a curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          If his voice had held all that I thought it held? Then I might have
          just hurt him again by blocking the number, cutting off communication.
          Running again.
        </p>
        <p>I had never hated myself as much as I did now. </p>

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p><b>NOTHING COULD </b>convince me otherwise.</p>
        <p>It was her.</p>
        <p>I <i>knew</i> it was her.</p>
        <p>
          The proof was in the silence that stretched between the frequencies of
          the call. It was encrusted in the way she breathed, the way my heart
          bottomed at the realization that it was her, the way her breath
          hitched when I called her name, and the way she ended the call and
          then blocked me only minutes later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been awake and active since that moment, confused yet hopeful,
          and alive for the first time in months. I could feel my pulse, could
          hear myself breathe, could feel the adrenaline in my veins when I
          drove to the compound and had my people track the number, breaking
          through whatever walls she had created by blocking me. Then I
          requested all the CCTV footage from months ago when she disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wouldn't be the first time I checked the footage; it wouldn't as
          well be the fifth or sixth, but it wasn't wholly bizarre to think that
          now that I was thinking quickly than my mind could follow or even
          comprehend, I might catch something new that I missed, there could be
          something different this time, something that could help. I had to try
          again, though I knew it would be fruitless. The security team said
          there had been no tampering with the cameras or security log files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I had always thought none of it made any sense. I wasn't
          delusional; I knew she had been there; everyone knew she had been with
          me, and suddenly, she was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something had to have happened; someone had to have moved her, someone
          who knew my systems...someone who knew how to create the perfect hoax.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had my suspicions, but I refused to hearken to that thought. For the
          first time in years, I let myself trust the people I hold dear, and I
          was not going to let something as measly as a gut feeling ruin that.
        </p>
        <p>
          With one hand resting at the top of my lips and the other drumming on
          the table, my attention was on the screen in front of me, but it was
          also everywhere else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Useless. It was useless rechecking these records, but I couldn't sit
          still waiting for yet another disappointment when it came to tracking
          Zahra down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every demon from months ago was louder than usual this morning. That
          call had shifted something in me. It redirected my approach to this
          situation. Thinking and acting with emotions at the forefront of my
          mind wasn't allowing me to get the job done or see what might have
          been right in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>She was alive.</p>
        <p>All this time, she had been alive somewhere...</p>
        <p>
          I brushed my hair back from my face, my eyes scanning the screen as I
          watched her comatose body on the bed for a few minutes before a blink
          and her body disappeared. I rolled the footage backward, checking the
          time like I had done a dozen times before, and just like those times,
          every minute had been deleted or missing. I rolled it back again; no
          video interruption, blur or static, rolled it back again; no cut, no
          skips, no loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          My teeth grazed by my bottom lip as my mind returned to the phone call
          a few hours ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why didn't she speak to me? Was she in a place where she couldn't
          talk? Was she held captive? Was she all right? Did she block me
          because the person with the phone couldn't know she had called me?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why now? Why today? What had happened? Zahra was stronger than every
          picture my mind was currently painting; if she had been held
          somewhere, she would have found a way to reach out before now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or maybe she wasn't in danger. Maybe she was all right and was scared
          to talk to me...perhaps I should have said more. I should have
          reminded her that I loved her. I should have told her I was losing my
          mind and that I needed her so much that it burned whenever I lived
          each day without hearing her voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although telling her all those things would have never been possible
          because she had ended the call the second I called her name, I had
          snapped upright, watching the screen for over a minute before my brain
          told me I was meant to call back. I did. I called her. I listened to
          it ring until it cut off. I had known in my heart that it wouldn't go
          through the next time I called, and I had been right. She had blocked
          my number from reaching her, leaving me with many questions, reasons,
          and possible solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she had called me multiple times, why would she stop me from
          talking to her? Why would she draw the space between us further and
          further apart?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why won't you let me find you, Zahra..." I whispered to myself,
          letting my head run with thoughts before blowing out a breath and
          running my palms down my face, tiredness pulling apart my sense of
          reasoning as confusion made me its footstool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Months, weeks, hours of me dwelling in the dark and light. Not knowing
          the whole picture.
        </p>
        <p>It was frustrating.</p>
        <p>
          How big could the world be? What exactly do I need to pull down to
          have her right by my side? How long do I have to watch this footage
          until I realize I have been bested and failed to protect the woman I
          love?
        </p>
        <p>
          The double doors to the boardroom pushed open, and I raised my head to
          find Elia walking in with a frown as the men stationed in front of the
          boardroom closed the doors behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You didn't tell me you were leaving the house," he said, gaze
          dropping to the laptop in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>"I had no reason to," I answered, looking away from him.</p>
        <p>
          "I think if it's regarding you finding Zahra, then you had every
          reason to. You have a number they're tracking? Did she...did she call
          you?" he asked cautiously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something about the tone in his voice had me raising my head again to
          regard him. The caution that had been in his voice was reflected in
          his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>It was clear as day; my brother was hiding something from me.</p>
        <p>
          Elia always hid things; in fact, a few months ago, I suspected he was
          seeing someone he thought I would disapprove of, hence why he sneaked
          out of the house. Still, I had hoped he would be free enough to tell
          me so he wouldn't see the need to sneak out, but I also knew he wasn't
          an open book; I believed he was taking his time to trust me, but
          something about the way he looked at me now, told me he knew something
          about Zahra that I didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clasped my hands together, watching him as I worked my jaw from left
          to right, then center. "She texted."
        </p>
        <p>His eyes widened a little. "Texted?"</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>Then, a frown lined his brows. "What did she say?"</p>
        <p>
          My eyes went between his as I relaxed on the chair, my gaze falling
          from his to the laptop screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought my clasped hands underneath my mouth to rest on my chin, my
          index fingers tapping on my knuckles as I looked at him again. "The
          same thing she told you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I caught the way he paused, his eyes widening with surprise, no longer
          hiding. His eyebrows twitched, lips parting to say something, but he
          didn't speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt my anger build slowly at all the signs I was getting,
          everything he was freely giving at the cusp of being caught on a
          secret that had been weighing on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She <i>had</i> called him. He <i>has</i> heard from Zahra...and he
          never told me, knowing how much I was going crazy trying to find her.
        </p>
        <p>"She told you...she told you she called me?"</p>
        <p>I wore a look of indifference. "How else would I have known?"</p>
        <p>
          He let my words hang in the air between us before he sighed, raking
          his fingers through his hair and dropping on the chair to my left. "I
          should have told you first," he confessed. "I just couldn't wrap my
          head around it at first, and you were doing okay; I didn't—I didn't
          want to fuck that up for you."
        </p>
        <p>I remained quiet, watching him.</p>
        <p>
          "You have to understand," he said, looking every bit as guilty as he
          should be.
        </p>
        <p>"When did she call you?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "A couple of weeks ago. I never returned her call. I know she said she
          needed help, but she sounded okay for someone who might need help, and
          I was going to find the time to speak to you about—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "She called me." I cut him off. "She did not text. When she called me,
          she didn't speak, neither did she tell me anything."
        </p>
        <p>
          His brows dropped, "What—" I saw the way realization drowned whatever
          color that had been on his face. "Hold on, did you—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "This trust thing goes both ways, Elia. You should have told me. This
          is Zahra we are talking about."
        </p>
        <p>
          His shoulders dropped with a sigh, eyes filling with worry. "You
          fooled me—fuck—Elio, listen, I wanted to tell—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "She could have been in danger; we still don't know how she left the
          compound; we don't know who took her or what state she might be in. I
          understand that she broke off the little family you have formed with
          the others, but I can assure you that if she had done that, it was for
          a good reason; at least, she might have thought that."
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't because—"</p>
        <p>
          "Are you the sort of person to stop caring about someone because they
          made a mistake once?" Guilt filled his eyes, and I continued, "She
          didn't sound like she needed help...what did you expect, her crying
          and shivering while she screamed and begged for your help?
          <i>Oh, great, Elia, come save me</i>. Is that what you expected?"
        </p>
        <p>His stare turned blank, "Of course not."</p>
        <p>
          I watched him for a long time before shaking my head and looking away
          from him to the screen again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not like being angry with him, but he had hidden this from me,
          and it took me cunningly pulling the answer out to have him tell me
          what had happened. It shouldn't have been that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio, I wanted to tell you, believe me, but there was no way I could
          put—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am disappointed, Elia." I looked at him, watching his face fall, "I
          thought we could trust each other,"
        </p>
        <p>He sat up, "Yes, we can."</p>
        <p>"Can we?"</p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck? Yes, we can...I didn't tell you because I was trying
          to protect you, okay? I didn't know what she wanted. I wanted to tell
          you, but then I found out she didn't just call me; she called all of
          STREET, saying the same thing: she needed our help. I am positive
          she's okay; I only stalled because I didn't know if—if telling you
          would bring that side of you out again."
        </p>
        <p>Irritation crawled up my spine. "What side of me?"</p>
        <p>
          "The side of you that went completely berserk when she disappeared.
          Fucking hell, Elio, you went off the rails; I couldn't do that to you
          again, not when I didn't know the full picture of what she truly
          wanted from any of us."
        </p>
        <p>"Ridiculous."</p>
        <p>"I was only doing what I thought was right,"</p>
        <p>
          "Do I look like a child to you, Elia? Keeping things from me because
          you don't want to <i>hurt</i> me, Do you know how nonsensical that
          sounds? Where even is this thought generating from?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Protection." He fired back. "Just like trust, protection goes both
          ways. You would do the same for me, too, if it comes down to that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him for what felt like minutes before looking away, shutting
          the laptop, and leveling him with a stare. "What exactly did she tell
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          His jaw locked, and he shifted on his seat, still hesitating. "That
          she needed help. She didn't tell me what for. I was supposed to call
          her back to ask, but...I never did."
        </p>
        <p>"Do you know where she is?"</p>
        <p>He went quiet—discomfort swirling in his eyes.</p>
        <p>Discomfort and fear.</p>
        <p>
          When he didn't answer, I sat upright, "Elia, do you know, where she
          is."
        </p>
        <p>He sighed, "Yes, I do."</p>
        <p>
          I could not hide the disbelief I felt from resurfacing on my face.
          "For how long, Elia?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A week. I swear. I reached out to Milk—who is now Penelope. She's
          here in Milan, trying to decide whether to go to Zahra or not. She
          gave me the address, Zahra's in Sicily, but in a private estate...very
          difficult to locate."
        </p>
        <p>I got to my feet. "Give me the address,"</p>
        <p>He blinked, "What?"</p>
        <p>"Did you go deaf a second ago?"</p>
        <p>"What do you plan to do, waltz in there and demand to see her?"</p>
        <p>
          "No, I plan to stare at the address like a moron and do absolutely
          nothing with it,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He got to his feet, too, "We should think about this; it's not wise to
          breech their area. The Conti building is also located around the
          estate. You have to be invited if you want to enter."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't have to do anything. In fact, I want them to try and stop me;
          maybe then I will finally put an end to my cravings. I adore a good
          blood bath,"
        </p>
        <p>"Elio, come on—"</p>
        <p>"The address, or I lock you up and beat it out of you,"</p>
        <p>
          His eyes squinted in a twitch like he was wondering if I could
          actually do that, but at the same time, scared that I would.
        </p>
        <p>
          A defeated sigh was all I heard from him before he began to pull out
          his phone; at that moment, the boardroom door opened again; Casmiro
          was walking in with a brown file in his grip, stare bouncing from Elia
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>"I heard you found a number," he said in greeting.</p>
        <p>"Now I'm about to get an address. When did you arrive?"</p>
        <p>
          "This morning." He said, gaze shifting to Elia, who was eyeing the
          file Casmiro was holding. "There's something you should know before
          you head out," he said, and I watched Elia's gaze snap right to his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't have time for whatever it was. "Tell me when I come back," I
          said, pinning Elia with a stare that had him bringing out his phone
          and texting me the address.
        </p>
        <p>When I moved to sidestep them both, Casmiro spoke.</p>
        <p>
          "You might want to hear this before you try to find her." I eyed him
          as he stood even straighter, "I'd rather you hear it from me than
          anyone else."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched Elia run his fingers through his hair as he sighed. He knew
          what this was about...either that or I was analyzing wrongly, based on
          the many emotions currently messing with my head.
        </p>
        <p>I had Zahra's address. I could see her.</p>
        <p>She wasn't too far from me.</p>
        <p>
          And it was all <i>too easy</i>, too easy, considering how long I'd
          been waiting for this moment.
        </p>
        <p>"What is this about?" I asked, watching Casmiro let out a breath.</p>
        <p>"Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          Of course. There had to be something else. As always. I could never
          have anything so easily handed to me. There had to be news that would
          wreck me along with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would think I'd be used to waiting for the last shoe to drop by
          now, but it never truly ends.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, "You know where she is too, don't you?"</p>
        <p>
          With a slight pause, he nodded. "I have been keeping tabs ever since
          she left the compound."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck," Elia cursed in a whisper, settling back on a chair as I
          watched Casmiro. The secrets bled into his eyes, becoming truths I had
          been holding myself from believing. I looked towards Elia, who
          couldn't even meet my gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A few weeks after Zahra disappeared, Vitale Conti contacted me. He
          told me he was the only one who could make sure she came out of coma
          alive. He was so self-assured that if we didn't move her, she would
          die. I didn't want to do it at first; I couldn't betray you like that,
          but then her condition worsened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I had no choice but to think of the other side. It would save her
          life if she left the compound and went back to her people. Vitale gave
          a strong, meaningful argument; we were fighting the same enemy—the
          MCSS. We needed Zahra alive; she held the keys to many things that
          could lead to a breakthrough in our mission, and I couldn't let her
          die. I knew you wouldn't see reason because you were too emotionally
          attached to her, so I made her disappear. It was my decision, and at
          that time, I also saw advantages."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia's confused gaze raised towards Casmiro, who didn't look at him.
          Not once.
        </p>
        <p>My jaw locked.</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro raised his chin, "I know I betrayed your trust, and I know we
          could never come back from this, but I'm not sorry because it was the
          right decision."
        </p>
        <p>When I didn't speak, he continued.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll leave the compound and move back to Capri. I know what I did is
          punishable by death, and I know you can't kill me, so I'll stay out of
          sight until I'm needed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Elia was on his feet again, but I didn't take my eyes off my friend
          even as he stared back, unflinching, mind made up, waiting for me to
          accept the punishment he was taking on himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can we not make any rash decisions now?" Elia voiced. "Casmiro, you
          shouldn't take all the—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Before I leave, you should see this," Casmiro cut him off,
          outstretching the file towards me. "It's the least I can do after
          taking her away from you. Like I said, I've been keeping tabs, and I
          personally don't think you should go to her, but if after you see
          those pictures, and you still want to, then I am behind you,
          nevertheless."
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind held a blank line for a long time before I took the file from
          him. My thoughts were empty of thoughts and judgment because I saw
          reason, but I also saw betrayal from both the people in this room, and
          he was right...I couldn't kill him. I couldn't hurt either of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was frowning at myself because I knew who I was. Months ago, I would
          have never let this slide; I would have done something so damning they
          wouldn't be able to look me in the eye, but right now...that urge to
          hurt the ones who hurt me was silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was that growth? Or was it something simmering, waiting for a lid to
          blow off before it attacked?
        </p>
        <p>
          I took out the pictures from the file, and my eyes scanned the images.
        </p>
        <p>A party.</p>
        <p>
          Zahra. She was smiling. She seemed happy. She exuded excitement. She
          was...lean. Her hair was longer. But something was...off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head to the side, watching the man beside her—Vitale
          Conti—with a big grin on his face, a wine glass on his gloved hand
          with an arm around my woman...my woman who wore a shiny ring on her
          finger, something quite similar to what the Conti man was wearing on
          his finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zahra wore a dress the same color as her crimson red lips,
          elegant...proper. Careful. Unlike the woman I know.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought my fingers to the line of her smile, dimpled just by the
          side of her lips, the forced crinkles by her eyes, the long curls of
          her hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was from her engagement party with Vitale Conti only a month
          ago," Casmiro informed.
        </p>
        <p>"I see..."</p>
        <p>
          Something heavy and hot was seeping its way into my chest, but I was
          quick to press it down, squeeze, and hold it firm as I blinked,
          slipping the pictures back into the file.
        </p>
        <p>There had to be an explanation.</p>
        <p>There <i>is</i> an explanation.</p>
        <p>
          I dropped the file on the table, seeing Casmiro and Elia's attention
          placed on me as if waiting for a certain explosion.
        </p>
        <p>"You should have told me Vitale reached out to you."</p>
        <p>"You would have never let her go, Elio," Casmiro said.</p>
        <p>
          "You're right. I would have argued, maybe even hit you again, find
          Vitale and kill him, but those were the thoughts that would have come
          to my head, and I would never really have gone through with them. But
          here's what would have happened if you had told me. It would have
          taken me hours, maybe even days, but I would have returned to Zahra's
          room and given it all a second thought. I would have put her safety
          first and my emotions and fears second."
        </p>
        <p>Silence settled in the space as they mulled over all I'd said.</p>
        <p>
          I sighed, "But you would not have known that." I nodded, taking in a
          breath and releasing it; the images I'd seen only a few minutes ago
          kept flashing in my head, messing with my thoughts, seeking a
          conclusion I was unwilling to give. "Did you do this alone? Moving
          Zahra."
        </p>
        <p>Casmiro hesitated but nodded. "Yes, it was just me."</p>
        <p>
          I glanced at Elia, whose face told me everything I needed. He couldn't
          look at me, neither could he look at Casmiro.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked between both of them once more before I nodded. "Hm." I
          picked up my suit from the back of my chair, slipping it on before
          focusing on Casmiro. "I will deal with this when I return; till then,
          you do not have my permission to leave the compound."
        </p>
        <p>He seemed confused as I slipped by him towards the door.</p>
        <p>"You're still going after her?" Elia asked.</p>
        <p>
          I stopped without turning back, "I'll have the tech team zero in on
          her number; I'll follow whatever location she is in."
        </p>
        <p>"She's engaged, Elio," he insisted.</p>
        <p>
          That hot feeling was spreading, but I swallowed it back down. "Yes.
          But I have seen Zahra smile and laugh; whatever she did in that
          picture was very unfamiliar. I'm worried; I should check for myself."
        </p>
        <p>"It might not be worth it," Casmiro spoke this time.</p>
        <p>
          I stopped and turned, juggling his words in my head before answering,
          "Do you know when I realized I was falling in love with her? It was
          the moment she broke down a piece of her walls and allowed me take a
          peek at all that was behind her pretense, when she told me things, she
          had never told anyone just because she thought I was worth it. Zahra
          is worth every heartbreak, every hurt, and every inconvenience the
          thought and sight of her might give me. That is how unconditional our
          love is."
        </p>
        <p>
          When they didn't utter a word to counter everything I said, I nodded
          and looked at Casmiro, "Make sure you see, Angelo. He has been worried
          about you. You can fill him in on everything else while you're at it."
          With that, I turned and left the boardroom with three things in mind.
        </p>
        <p>Find Zahra. Get an explanation. Settle this once and for all. </p>

        <p>
          The simple breakfast in front of me didn't smell bad, and my chef,
          Aurora, was terrific. She had been in this mansion as long as I had
          been. She made meals that would make you want to eat until you threw
          up and then eat again because you didn't want the taste of the food to
          leave your tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The well-garnished and prepared bacon and eggs before me looked like
          heaven. On a normal day, months ago, my mouth would have been watering
          at the sight; I would have probably finished it in a matter of
          minutes, licked the plate, and my hands clean like the dirty eater I
          was, but now, sitting in this large as hell dining room, at the head
          of a long table that could fit forty people, surrounded by old
          paintings, maroon red and dark green walls, complimenting the crimson
          and black colored thin rug on the ground, and the blood red table
          cloth stretching from my end to the other end of the table, I wanted
          to run from the food.
        </p>
        <p>From the house and this space.</p>
        <p>
          The Oval-shaped golden sconces highlighted the paintings, and the
          golden lights from the dining chandelier made the food look even more
          delicious than expected. It was morning, but it always felt like night
          in this house. It was always dark, themed to look like you were in
          hell but on the more affluent side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the whole setting around me wasn't why the food in front of
          me felt like my enemy, it also wasn't because I was eating alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had tried eating out before, and the food seemed like a stranger I
          didn't want to be acquainted with. Along with the drinking problems I
          had after waking up, this was also a problem. I was avoiding food. I
          selected what I ate and was satisfied with coke and chips rather than
          real food. This added to my weight loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I were hungry enough to eat like I used to, wish I could gobble
          food and jump in anticipation when a plate of meat was in front of me.
          I wish I could go back to being that Zahra who grew from being this
          thing that said no to food.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't unfamiliar. I was this way before I left Sicily years ago,
          but then I met STREET; I became comfortable in my skin and my
          surroundings, I felt like a different person, and I thought for one
          foolish moment that now that I was different, now that I had grown, I
          would be the better version of myself when I returned to Sicily, but
          that hadn't been the case.
        </p>
        <p>This house remained resilient in being the bane of my existence.</p>
        <p>
          I moved my fork around the plate, blowing a breath and sighing,
          longing to be hungry enough to eat this goddess in front of me, but as
          usual, I wasn't.
        </p>
        <p>Dropping the fork, I drew my chair back and got to my feet.</p>
        <p>
          Aurora appeared from the kitchen with a slight frown. "Isn't it to
          your liking?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile was tight. "It's perfect, but I can't concentrate; there's
          too much work to get done today."
        </p>
        <p>She remained quiet, lips pursed.</p>
        <p>
          Her greying hair was pulled up in a tight bun, her face younger than
          her age of fifty-one. A nutritionist and a professional chef, Aurora
          had quickly befriended Vitale's mother; I had no doubt she would be
          spilling my eating habits to her if it continued like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking my light brown suit from the chair by the left, I wore it above
          the plunged-necked, well-fitted light brown waistcoat, almost the same
          color as my skin. It gave my cleavage a very generous display,
          showcasing the serpent tattoo. The pleated pants of the two-piece were
          a little on the bigger size but fit around my waist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had more outfits of the same designs with different colors. All
          custom made by a renowned designer in Los Angeles, with some other
          corporate wears that housed designs Milk had drawn into a notebook
          once, designs she felt would look amazing on me...designs she had
          wanted to create for me when she built her brand.
        </p>
        <p>I caught Aurora watching me with concern.</p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I managed an easy smile. "You don't have to worry, Aurora, I
          just don't have the appetite to eat,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was what you said yesterday, and then the day before that, and
          the one before that."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe I'm no longer a breakfast person?"</p>
        <p>
          Her stare grew blank, "Skipping breakfast is bad, skipping lunch is
          terrible, skipping dinner is a crime, you'll be skipping life if you
          continue with this pattern,"
        </p>
        <p>My chest shook with laughter, and her eyes softened.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm worried about you. You skip a lot of meals, and it's beginning to
          show," her eyes moved to my neck, "I shouldn't be seeing your
          collarbones; you're not some vogue underwear model,"
        </p>
        <p>
          My brows fell into a curious frown as I shifted on my feet, "Wait, I
          could pass for one?"
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head with a small smile, "You could,"</p>
        <p>
          I grinned but tamed it, brushing the material of my suit. "I would
          consider it, but The Serpents would kick me out of their midst in a
          heartbeat,"
        </p>
        <p>"You own The Serpents,"</p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head to the side, nodding as I grabbed my purse,
          "Huh...you're right, I own The Serpents,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She sighed, "Just be home on time for lunch or dinner, all right?"
        </p>
        <p>"I will, thank you, Aurora."</p>
        <p>
          I made my way out of the dining room, fishing for my phone in my purse
          and catching a missed call from Vitale, and then a text message that
          said he would be running late today for some reason, which meant I
          would have to handle Ignazio on my own. Great.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't question it when four men followed behind me as I scrolled
          through my contact list, finding my assistant's contact and clicking
          his name as I simultaneously found my sunglasses and slipped them on.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was hot and bright outside, and I was glad I decided to wear my
          hair in a ponytail, accentuating my cheekbones and relieving me of
          irritation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A driver and a few men were already around the car, and three other
          vehicles were waiting steadily behind it just as I put a call through
          to my assistant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded to the man who had the car opened for me. I slipped in,
          throwing my purse beside me as my assistant answered the call and the
          car door closed. "Any reason why I'm walking alone, Siro?"
        </p>
        <p>"I can—"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't have my schedule for this week, I don't have moral support, I
          don't have updates on how my organization is doing, I'm walking
          blindly into the lion's den on an empty stomach, I would hate to be
          eaten by the lions when I'm the hungry one, Siro,"
        </p>
        <p>"I know—"</p>
        <p>
          "I really don't think you have an excuse unless your wife went into
          Labor last night, and you rushed out without your phone—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Miss Faizan, Meredith did go into labor, and I just returned
          home to get my phone and some things for her. I was about to call you
          and send you everything you would need today. I'm sorry for every
          inconvenience—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's okay, I'll ask Vitale for help if there's anything I don't
          understand,"
        </p>
        <p>"Or you could just text me, I'm gonna be on hand—"</p>
        <p>"Stay with your family,"</p>
        <p>"You're sure?"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry about me, Siro; if they start speaking words I don't
          understand, I'll do what I do best: Stare with full concentration like
          I understand everything. I'll record the meeting, though, in case
          there's anything you might need,"
        </p>
        <p>"All right, thank you, Miss Faizan,"</p>
        <p>
          "Sure, say hi to Meredith for me; tell her I'll drop by later in the
          day to see her and the baby,"
        </p>
        <p>"Of course, have a good day, Miss Faizan,"</p>
        <p>"You too, and congratulations, Siro,"</p>
        <p>"Thank you,"</p>
        <p>
          With a small smile he couldn't see, I ended the call as the smile
          cracked from my face, and I relaxed back on the car seat, letting out
          a small breath as we began moving.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the last Wednesday of the month, which meant meeting day, a
          little briefing with Serpent members as we recounted all we were doing
          and what we could do to take the society to enormous heights, with
          Vitale being the new Serpent head and me being his sponsor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had many enemies on those seats, but we owned the table, and it
          would take more than a lot to shove us away. The ring on my finger and
          the joining of what used to be Martino's crime family and The Serpents
          gave us more power—enough for Vitale to work through this probation
          period. We did a lot to convince people that our engagement was real.
          I didn't know how long we could stay engaged, but I hoped it was
          enough.
        </p>
        <p>The goal was to Marry Vitale, but I couldn't do it.</p>
        <p>
          I was once willing to; we had a deal before I left Sicily. He would
          watch over my city, handle the affairs, and keep Martino's absence a
          secret for as long as he could while I worked on getting the flash
          drive for the pedophile ring, return to Sicily, and marry him so he
          could get his seat at the table with my power, and then we could
          destroy our enemies together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, a lot has changed. I fell in love and wasn't willing to risk a
          life with Elio for this, so I stuck to just engagement. And now the
          stakes were higher because Vitale didn't just get a seat. He got the
          Serpent head position and led the secret society, thanks to the flash
          drives we had gotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't like to get too involved with The Serpents business, but
          there was a new table of society and crime family members; it was why
          I got myself an assistant...at least one of the reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hadn't gone to school. I wouldn't consider the home lessons with
          fear at the back of my mind and molestation every night a good
          learning environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could speak and understand English. I could also understand and
          speak some other languages, but I couldn't <i>really</i> read them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could read English, but I wasn't perfect with it either; my eyes
          filtered words too big to pronounce and understand, and I was only
          stuck on the main details I understood. I didn't know anything about
          numbers except the basic stuff, and well, I had a calculator on my
          phone to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I woke up, I had Vitale break down some of what had been written
          in the MCSS flash drive and some details I realized Elio couldn't have
          known or been involved in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale and Siro were the only ones who knew I was a little lacking in
          the reading and writing department. STREET had never really wondered
          why I wrote things like I was texting. I had issues with spelling; I
          used my common sense sometimes to spell things; most times, I'm
          correct, and most times, I'm not.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was embarrassed by this little flaw. It wasn't as though I lacked
          completely—I could read easy English and write things down. Though my
          handwriting was an eyesore, Dog had never failed to make fun of me
          whenever he read my jottings—but I was lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remembered once when I took one of Elio's books; I couldn't get too
          far because I was lazy and I got tired; it may also have been the
          fault of the book having a tiny font and words I couldn't pronounce
          without faltering and reading twice. There was also that time when I
          saw Elio's handwriting; I had been so jealous. It was pretty,
          effortless, elegant, like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martino had known of this flaw; sometimes, I suspected Ignazio was
          also aware. Still, he had never once pointed it out. Besides, if
          there's something I'm good at, it's pretending and keeping secrets—so
          it wasn't hard for me to get by. There was no harm in listening and
          keeping quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          About forty minutes later, I walked down the long hallway to the
          boardroom where the meeting was held.
        </p>
        <p>
          The building was an hour from my home but still in the same estate. I
          didn't like the space; it had an air of something wrong...something
          dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the headquarters of the Secret Society, where I had spent a lot
          of time being looked after by Vitale. The headquarters where I had
          been treated, marked, and probed—I couldn't be sure, but I wouldn't
          put anything past these people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got to the intersection, where I had to let go of my security
          detail, seeing as they couldn't be in the same room or area where the
          meeting was being held.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering the boardroom, almost everyone was there, standing at
          different areas, drinking and conversing. The room held nearly thirty
          men in fine maroon suits, all tailored and uniformed in the same
          style. I stuck out like a sore thumb; everyone turned to regard me.
          Men, ranging from age twenty-five to seventy, some holding stares of
          distaste, and most holding stares of disapproval.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't care. I wasn't willing to conform to their occultic
          traditions; I might bear their mark on my chest, displaying it boldly
          with my cleavage right on display as I took my suit off and hung it on
          my arm, but I wouldn't bend to their rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignazio approached me, but I pretended I didn't see him coming over as
          I dropped my purse right on my seat beside Vitale's at the head of the
          table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Puppet didn't come with you today?" he asked, one gloved hand
          pocketed, the other holding a drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Puppet. His degrading nickname for his brother. Vitale and Ignazio
          were like heat on a sunny day and cold on a stormy night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood on the sidelines for years, watching Ignazio and Martino
          become Vitale's demons; they shoved him around and belittled him
          because they always thought he lacked the spine to be in their world,
          in the Society. He was bullied, beaten, and degraded until his world
          became black and white.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was why I never questioned Vitale's acceptance of all I had planned
          to get Martino out of the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What was it? Lovers quarrel?" Ignazio's voice brought me out of my
          thoughts, and when I didn't respond, He continued, shifting on his
          feet and leaning closer to me so only I would hear his following
          words, "What did he do? Couldn't satisfy your sexual urges?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, crossing my arms against my chest and turning to look at
          him; light blonde hair slipped back, dark blue eyes piercing and
          malicious with devilish intents, his gaze falling to my chest in
          appreciation. "He satisfies me perfectly, Ignazio, not like you would
          know what that means."
        </p>
        <p>
          He threw his head back, laughing wholeheartedly like I had said the
          funniest thing in the universe.
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to gut him.</p>
        <p>
          Ignazio, at 32, had collected his mother's beauty, the blonde hair and
          blue eyes; though his eyes were a little on the darker side of blue,
          unlike Vitale's, it added to the odd and disgusting aura around him. I
          never liked him. Never liked that I couldn't kill him...<i>just yet</i
          >. He sometimes haunted my nightmares; seeing his face brought back
          memories I would have loved to erase and burn. Memories Vitale knew
          nothing about. Memories that lay hidden in the flash drive now in
          Elio's possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You never fail to make me laugh, Zahra. Almost feels like that is the
          only quality you're known for." His eyes held that taunting edge,
          "That and well..." his gaze fell to my chest again, "Satisfying
          men..."
        </p>
        <p>My smile was wide as I nodded, "Right,"</p>
        <p>"Right indeed," he raised his glass to me, "I would know,"</p>
        <p>
          "You're referring to the time you raped me, right? Because I can't
          think of another time when you would know how awesome I am at
          satisfying men,"
        </p>
        <p>
          His frown was playful as he turned entirely towards me, "You're still
          on that rape bullshit."
        </p>
        <p>
          "As long as you're still alive and breathing, I'll forever remain on
          it...last I checked, you're the only one still alive from that time;
          as you know, all your friends are like...six feet deep, dining with
          maggots and worms."
        </p>
        <p>
          He rolled his eyes, "Come on, Little Z, It isn't rape if you loved
          it,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," I nodded, "Right, a woman cries and begs you to stop fucking her
          is her loving the sex...I wonder how many women stuck around long
          enough to have you make her beg and scream like that again, Ignazio."
        </p>
        <p>"A lot, if you're so curious. I even have a list."</p>
        <p>
          My jaw clenched, but I wasn't angry, nor was the conversation making
          me uncomfortable. Ignazio was a waste of space; his mother was the
          only reason he was still breathing. I never told Vitale what Martino
          and Ignazio did to me all those years ago when they found out I was
          aiming to step up. Vitale never knew the reason why I had switched up
          our plans at the last minute, and he would never know because I feared
          he would kill his brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          That would break his mother, break what little was left of their
          family, and I couldn't be responsible for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I give a good time, Little Z," he grinned, walking closer to me, "In
          fact, if my brother is lacking in that department, I can offer you a
          free night in paradise with me,"
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, I'll have to check my schedule,"</p>
        <p>
          "I promise you would want to cancel all that you have planned," he
          said slowly, bringing his lips to my ear, his perfume twisting my
          stomach, twisting so hard that it took all and everything in me not to
          throw up. "I have learned a few new tricks over the years,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I almost gagged. "I don't doubt it, you seem to only think real
          thoughts with your dick, it's unique,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He pulled back, his face a mix of confusion. I could tell he wasn't
          sure if I was complimenting him or the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Loosen up, Zahra," he said, clearing his throat. "You need more
          friends than enemies on this table. Vitale is a whiny little brat. You
          need someone strong enough to protect and stand by you; you're on the
          losing team if you think Vitale is that person.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, watching him with all my attention, "This is your problem,
          Ignazio. You live in the past. You live in constant denial." My eyes
          went between his, watching discomfort litter his composed form. "When
          will you see that you answer to the whiny little brat? He has the
          final say; he can kick you off the board if he so wishes to. If I were
          you, I would be licking his boots and serving him with all I've got."
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips lifted in a sneer, "You're the only reason he has that
          position. He might seem all grown up now, but he will forever be that
          spineless, whiny little brat to me. No title or seat would change
          that." He took a step back from me. "You should come to the winning
          team, Little Z; I can protect you, and trust me when I say you need
          protection because you do..." his stare turned a little dark as he
          added, "You need all the help you can get for what is coming."
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned just as he turned to leave, and the door opened; Vitale
          stepped into the space with the same maroon-colored suit as everyone
          else. I looked back at Ignazio, who was eying the room like he knew
          something we didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          It disturbed me, and I had to shake my head slightly to remove myself
          from that thinking space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone took their respective stand behind their seats as Vitale
          walked towards me. Hair brushed back moderately, steps solid and firm
          as if the ground understood his footsteps needed to be respected.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he reached me, he wrapped his arm around my waist and brought his
          lips to mine in a quick kiss—a little convincing show he carried
          diligently to show the ones who still had eyes on us that we were very
          much in love and wanted to get married for that reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          He let me go, took his seat, and gave a short nod, our cue to sit.
        </p>
        <p>
          As everyone took their seats, my eyes roamed the table, seeing the
          short silver goblets in front of everyone in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Serpent Head, Vitale was the first to pick up his goblet before
          everyone else followed—everyone but me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched them all chorus unanimously, their little ritual.
          <i
            >"To the souls that spilled to quench. The mothers that bled to
            create, and the hands that guide thy Serpent ways."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, shifting uncomfortably as they all fell silent. I didn't
          need to look up to know their eyes were on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands fisted on the table as my gaze rose to find Vitale's stare.
          Cold and empty, like the feeling swirling around the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around to see everyone still lifting their goblet, waiting
          for me to pick up mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaze falling back to Vitale's; I watched him pointedly stare at the
          silver goblet in front of me before his gaze rose to the tattoo on my
          chest and then slowly traveled to my eyes. I looked away from him,
          picking up the goblet with surprisingly steady hands as my gaze found
          Ignazio's smug stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clenched my jaw and locked my gaze with his as I spoke. "To the
          souls that spilled to quench. The mothers that bled to create, and the
          hands that guide thy Serpent ways." Then I downed the red drink in the
          cup, ignoring the metallic taste swirling with the old wine, holding
          off my gag as I watched everyone else drink and drop their cups.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to find Vitale's eyes on me, a small, proud smile lingering
          on his lips as he looked away, straightened his suit, sat up, and
          said, "Shall we begin?"
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          It wasn't an easy argument with Vitale, leaving the headquarters on my
          own after the meeting concluded, but he had so much to take care of,
          and I had so much to take care of, too. More than anything, I wanted
          to drive alone, without protection. I could protect myself well enough
          and didn't need people getting into my business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale hesitated, but I told him I'd be fine and would return to the
          mansion before dinner. I'd also told him I would be at the hospital
          with Siro's wife, seeing her and the new baby; I didn't need people
          flooding the hospital and drawing unnecessary attention. That seemed
          to have calmed him and removed suspicions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I was going to head to the hospital, but after that, I had a
          little something private to get done.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fingers tapped on my steering wheel as I cut to the highway leading
          out of the Conti estate.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only fitting to visit the hospital; I'd met Siro's wife several
          times; she was wonderful and had been so excited to see her baby. I
          was also excited to see the newborn. I love children. Contrary to the
          life I lived now, I had been that little girl who wished to own toys
          shaped like plastic babies, brushing hair and giving them forehead
          kisses. That phase of my life had bled off quickly, but it had been
          there—the motherly instincts. One that soon dug itself deep into my
          mind when I learned I couldn't have any child of my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          That dream was dead, along with many others. Regardless, I still loved
          children; I loved to hold them, hug them, and look at them. It felt
          like reliving a childhood I had been robbed of, reminding myself of
          the innocence I had been stripped of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had plans to adopt maybe sometime in the future if I survived
          through all that I had—
        </p>
        <p>
          Something rammed into my car from behind, and I jerked forward, lost
          control of the steering wheel for a few seconds as the vehicle ran off
          course. I gripped the steering wheel tight, swerving my body like it
          was the car itself; a screeching sound from the tires filled my ears
          as I struggled to maneuver the vehicle to the side of the road,
          slamming on the brake as the airbag popped right off, slapping me in
          the face while the car that had collided with me drove past but curved
          to pull over right in front.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something warm sled down my nostrils, and I rubbed it off to see blood
          on my fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit," I cursed, raising my head as I fished for a handkerchief in my
          purse. I found one, pressing it against my nose. "Fucking airbag," I
          muttered with my heart still in my throat, expelling a breath as I
          turned off the engine, collecting myself from what could have been a
          fatal accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made sure the bleeding had stopped before I discarded the
          handkerchief, opened the door, and got out of the car, not even
          bothering to check the other party, as I walked right to the back
          where I had been hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh fuck—oh come the fuck on!" I yelled, throwing my hands up and
          letting them land at my sides in defeat as I watched the back of my
          car pressed and dropped at an odd angle; the back bumper was damaged,
          and a huge dent curled from the trunk to the side of the—it was
          fucked. I knew I heard a loud crash upon impact, but it couldn't have
          been so bad, "Ugh,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, anger simmering as I snapped my gaze towards the black
          Rolls Royce. I matched towards my car when I realized no other cars
          were coming by. Swiftly, I slid into my car via my knees, opened the
          glove compartment and grabbed a gun, checking the bullet casing. "That
          motherfucker better not be dead because I'm gonna kill the fucker
          myself," I gritted, clocking the weapon just as the sound of their car
          door opened and close.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smirking with all the malice of the soul, I hurriedly slipped out of
          my car, outstretching my gun as I spoke, "It's either you're as high
          as a fucking—"
        </p>
        <p>I stopped.</p>
        <p>
          My words slipped right down my throat, tightened, and pressed into
          silence as I stared at the person who had hit me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gun shook in my hand, clattering to the floor at how weak my arm
          had suddenly grown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing right there, in front of me, in a black trench coat under a
          black turtle neck sweater and black slacks, with both his hands tucked
          into his pockets as he watched me with calculating grey eyes, my heart
          had forgotten how to create beats. It was stumbling on itself, missing
          turns and spaces where it was supposed to pump; it forgot pace and,
          rhythm and normality. It forgot everything, scrambling away from the
          sight before me—the person before me.
        </p>
        <p>My lips were parted in shock, my eyes wide, my body frozen.</p>
        <p>I was in shock, and I still wasn't sure I was breathing.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes took me in, toe to head, our gaze locking and staying as he
          spoke,
        </p>

        <p>
          The familiar low timbre of his voice and that nickname had my heart
          squeezing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to swallow, but my mouth was dry. I wanted to collect myself,
          but I tried and failed. I needed to steady my breathing, but the more
          I did, the more winded I felt, and my chest...my chest felt tight, and
          it grew even tighter by the second.
        </p>
        <p>Disbelief was the most prominent emotion attacking my insides.</p>
        <p>
          He was really here. I was blinking, and he wasn't going away; he was
          watching me, waiting for me to speak, run, pick up my gun, and shoot.
          I couldn't be sure what he wanted, but I was sure of what I saw in his
          eyes: confusion, longing, and maybe a little bit of anger, telling
          from his frown that was slowly deepening with each second that
          passed—But then again, I couldn't be sure. Not about this. Not about
          anything at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>Everything in me softened as I took him in.</p>
        <p>
          He looked a little different, healthier. His hair was fuller and
          longer, and there was a particular shine to him that wasn't previously
          present. Like he had let go of some baggage he had been carrying. It
          was a good change, and I wished I could tell him that, but this wasn't
          how we were supposed to meet; it wasn't the right time.
        </p>
        <p>
          A car sped by on the highway, and I gasped, stumbling back and
          blinking out of the daze that I was in.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You—" I stopped with how hoarse I sounded, so I cleared my throat,
          found a swallow to take down the tightness that had been blocking my
          vocal cords, and, "How did you find me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Technology." He answered, gaze shifting to my car, "And maybe a
          certain phone call from you as well. Also, my brother, a little
          tracker, a private jet, and then my car, the highway, you, me..."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have done anything to keep him talking, but this couldn't be
          happening. I wasn't ready for it. I still had too many eyes on me; I
          couldn't slip up now. It would all be for nothing if I entertained any
          communication with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          With reasonable effort, I dragged my gaze from him, "You shouldn't
          have come here or tried to find me. I didn't want to be found,"
        </p>
        <p>"You called me,"</p>
        <p>"Butt dial,"</p>
        <p>"At four AM."</p>
        <p>
          "I—" my brain tried to find answers, "I don't know? My butt dialed it
          while I was sleeping?"
        </p>
        <p>"Five times?"</p>
        <p>
          I looked up at him again, "Stranger things have happened, Marino, and
          what the fuck!" I turned to my car, "You seriously didn't have to hit
          my car; you could have just cornered me like a normal fucking human
          being. The car could have tumbled over; I could have died!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "At least I would know death was the only reason you didn't call me
          sooner. Maybe I was aiming to kill you; give myself an excuse not to
          be angry at you."
        </p>
        <p>
          The hardness in his voice had me blinking and turning my body to face
          him fully.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze fell to my chest, and I knew he probably just noticed the
          damned tattoo. I briefly wondered what he thought about it, if he knew
          what it meant, and how close to the society I was. I shoved the
          thoughts back down, focusing on our current situation. "Why the fuck
          would you be angry at me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised his gaze from my chest with a stern frown, "I beg your
          pardon?"
        </p>
        <p>"You have no reason to be angry or try to find me, Marino."</p>
        <p>
          Indignation dropped his eyebrows, and it seemed as if he couldn't
          comprehend how I could be speaking the words I was saying. "You were
          <i>taken</i> from me,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," I shook my head, standing straighter and tightening my will as I
          built a high, thick, impenetrable wall against the feelings searing in
          my chest. "I was <i>saved from</i> you, big difference," I said,
          looking away from him, feigning indifference and disinterest as I
          studied the damages on the car. "Fucking hell, this is bad,"
        </p>
        <p>"Saved from me?" he questioned.</p>
        <p>
          I chewed on my bottom lip, "Yes," Looking back at him, I placed my
          hands on my hip, "We weren't exactly best friends before I almost
          died, did you forget?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," he answered immediately, taking measured steps toward me. My
          bold façade faltered, but I stood firm as he stopped a foot distance
          away; I could feel his addictive warmth, could smell his familiar
          cologne; just a step more and my body would be pressed to his; I could
          hug him and breathe him in until my lungs begged for mercy, it felt
          like seeing a very delicious candy you've been craving, and now your
          fingertips were almost touching it, but for some reason, you couldn't
          claim it or take it. It was torture. This longing was torture. "I did
          not forget." He finished his statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Swallowing was tricky—I needed to step back and create more space.
          Disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is impossible to forget something as cruel as the look on your
          face before you stopped breathing, Zahra." The frown left his brows,
          and his eyes softened as he searched my face, as if he were checking
          for that same expression. "It is impossible to forget what had
          happened before, the conversation we never finished, your accusation
          and fear I once thought I would never be able to quench because I
          couldn't let go of a gun."
        </p>
        <p>
          His stare was intense, holding mine to the point that I couldn't look
          away to save myself from the raw touch of his emotions seeking mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then you disappeared," he continued, "After being in coma for months,
          you disappeared. I searched the whole damn continent for you, wreaked
          unnecessary havoc in your name, and now suddenly, seven months later,
          you call my brother," his eyes hardened once more, "Called your
          friends, gave them your location, called me, but then blocked me for
          whatever imbecilic reason, and now you are engaged to that man,
          standing right in front of me, telling me I have no reason to be
          angry?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My chest was squeezing, and my heart was changing rhythm, beating
          twice as fast as it had once been.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how hard he tried to mask it, I could hear the hurt in his
          voice and how much he was trying to put it second to everything else
          he was feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I deserve at least...an explanation, Zahra," his voice grew softer,
          "Why didn't you reach out to me? Why is that ring on your finger?
          Why—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your questions are irrelevant," I said through the tightness in my
          throat and the heaviness in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>"Irrelevant?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, you don't deserve an explanation from me, Elio," the surprise
          and disbelief in his eyes rocked me. I shifted my gaze from him,
          falling a step back. "I genuinely have no reason to give you one
          because me and you? We're nothing." The lie felt like rusted scissors,
          cutting painfully slow at the fragile strings holding my chest at bay.
          "I ended all there was between us right before I was shot. You
          shouldn't have tried to find me or go through all that waste because
          I'm not yours, I never was,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't speak for almost a minute, but a confused frown was on his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another car flew by, and it took a lot to hide my flinch. I couldn't
          be out here with him like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up at him once more, "I'm engaged to the person I want to be
          with, and I shared my location with everyone who mattered to me; make
          of that, what you will,"
        </p>
        <p>"So I don't matter to you? Is that what you're saying?"</p>
        <p>
          I locked my jaw, pushing down a hard swallow. "You ought to have known
          that by now. You're smart; you can tell when I'm lying."
        </p>
        <p>"You <i>are</i> lying."</p>
        <p>
          "And you are delusional," I muttered. "I meant what I said. We don't
          owe each other anything. This wasn't real, what we had was nothing—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't say things like that," he countered immediately, "It is very
          unfair because I know you do not mean them, and it makes it worse
          because I know you are trying to hurt me on purpose."
        </p>
        <p>"Elio—"</p>
        <p>
          "All I am asking for is an explanation; make me understand why you
          choose to be away from me; I am not fatuous; I will understand if it
          is indispensable."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's the thing." I met his gaze head-on. "You don't understand what
          I'm trying to say, and I'm trying to soften the blow by being gentle,
          but if you want to know why none of this matters, fine."
        </p>
        <p>Fuck. Fuck. <i>Fuck!</i></p>
        <p>
          "I left Sicily knowing if I ever returned, I would be engaged and
          married to Vitale. I had fun with you; it was great, but it was never
          meant to last." My limbs felt weak, and I let my body rest on the car
          behind me as I looked down at my feet, his quietness speaking in
          volumes that made me feel guilty even to raise my gaze, "I wanted to
          tell you...I was going to tell you everything, but then I found the
          flash drives and learned about the MCSS and your involvement with
          them, and...it all went to shit."
        </p>
        <p>"Fun..." he said quietly. "You had <i>fun</i> with me..."</p>
        <p>"Obviously, that's all you could take out from all I just said,"</p>
        <p>
          "Did you hear it? Did you hear all you just said to me, Zahra?
          <i>Fun?</i>"
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes stung, and a slight tremor swirled through me. "This isn't my
          fault, okay?" I met his gaze, which now held the hurt he had been
          trying to push back. "I didn't ask for any of this bullshit; you
          assumed a lot when it came to us; you were so in over your head that
          you didn't stop to think or ask yourself why I never said it back."
        </p>
        <p>He paused, his eyes squinting in question.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't remove my eyes from his as I said, "When you told me you
          loved me...every time you said those words. I never said it back. Not
          once, didn't you ever wonder why?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I never had to; you did not need to say it back, Zahra. I knew how
          you felt—"
        </p>
        <p>"You assumed."</p>
        <p>
          "I <i>knew</i>," he said, gaze moving between mine, "Stop saying all
          these things; don't disrespect us like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, pulled them open again, and looked to the side,
          blinking away tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand if you don't want to tell me what's going on," he said,
          "but don't speak words you won't be able to take back."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned sharply toward him, "Who says I want to take them back?" I
          shifted on my feet, "Maybe you need to know how I truly feel. I have
          managed to push back these emotions for weeks, trying to forget about
          gutting you because someone I care about loves you."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          I pushed at his chest, creating distance between us and cutting him
          off as I stood straighter, collecting the little pieces of myself that
          had melted without me even realizing it. "This isn't okay; you are the
          one being unfair. Hitting my car, intercepting me like I was supposed
          to fly to your arms and thank you for finding me, or wreaking havoc
          for me. Doing shit I never asked for. Saying stuff that I don't give
          two fucks about; You are suffocating, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          His face fell, and I held back tears when I could find nothing but
          hurt in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another car swept by, and I didn't know if I was paranoid or if the
          vehicle really slowed down a bit to watch, but it was gone as soon as
          I had seen it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How can you say that?" He asked, pulling my attention back to him.
          "I'm here because I care; I did all those things for you because I
          love you, and I was worried about you—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want it!" I yelled, "I don't want your care or your love,"
        </p>
        <p>"Another lie,"</p>
        <p>
          "Are you even listening to a word I'm saying? Do I have to spell it
          out for you? You can't just show up like this! Not after everything I
          learned!"
        </p>
        <p>"Then let us talk about it; let me explain everything."</p>
        <p>"I don't need your explanation. I don't care about it,"</p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>
          "Seeing you reminds me of all the shit I went through, okay? It's
          really <i>suffocating</i>, Elio. Knowing all I know about the MCSS,
          your presence makes me want to peel my fucking skin off. I don't know
          what you think you saw but think about it. How on earth would I ever
          love someone like you?" It went quiet between us, and I watched his
          eyes grow a shade darker, tension releasing from his brows as my words
          sank in. I averted my gaze. "I don't know if anyone's ever told you
          this, but you're just not...you're not really love material, Elio."
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment it left my mouth, I regretted it—And when I looked at him,
          I knew I had done real damage. I had gone too far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tears were welling in this man's eyes as he slowly took a step back
          from me. He removed his eyes from me and nodded. "I apologize," he
          said, never reaching my gaze once. "I shouldn't have come."
        </p>
        <p>
          This was what I wanted, him to leave, to be far away from here until
          the time was right, but it felt so fucking wrong; He knew me. He could
          read me like an open book, and I knew he was probably aware of what I
          was trying to do, but it didn't hurt any less.
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, "Elio, I—"</p>
        <p>He turned away from me, walking in the direction of his car.</p>
        <p>I didn't stop him.</p>
        <p>I couldn't.</p>
        <p>
          The gaping hole in my chest expanded the further he went. It grew,
          watching him unlock his car door and slipping inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          I caught the dent at the front of the car from when he had hit me. And
          I worried for a moment if the vehicle was in good shape to be driven.
          But he had started the engine, and it gave a reassuring sound that had
          me relaxing, but my chest didn't stop hurting as I watched the vehicle
          move...
        </p>
        <p>
          I still stood there, locked on the spot as he drove away, the car
          disappearing into the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked my blurry vision clear, tears sliding down my cheeks as more
          built up in my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the society caught wind of this little visit so close to the
          estate, things would get ugly. I knew I had many enemies, waiting for
          a little slip-up to kick Vitale off the board before the probation
          period was over, but we only had a month left. A month, and we could
          call off this charade.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I stood there, eyes still on the path Elio's car had disappeared, I
          wondered if it was worth it, if hurting him the way I did just now was
          worth anything because it sure as hell didn't feel like it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept fucking things up when it came to him. I had never been
          bothered about consequences because I knew him to be reasonable if
          given a proper explanation. But how long? How long would he tolerate
          the hurt I always caused him? When would he crack and realize I wasn't
          good enough for him? The next time I hurt him? The next time I lie to
          his face?
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't keep doing this. It was bad behavior. Toxic in all sense,
          and he didn't deserve that—maybe this was for the best. Perhaps I
          should leave him alone; he was doing okay now; he didn't need the
          baggage that came with me. He needed something stable and clean, not
          something like me. I could only offer him nothing but trouble, and he
          didn't need that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had once said he didn't deserve me. But I had been foolish. It was
          the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't deserve him.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The baby in my arms served as a cure for the turmoil residing in every
          nerve in my body. I cooed softly, rocking her gently. She felt so
          warm, soft to hold, fragile in all the best ways, and God, she was
          beautiful too.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have a feeling she's going to look more like you when she's a big
          girl; Siro isn't all that," I said softly, and Meredith laughed from
          her position on the bed as she drank the soup her husband had brought
          in about ten minutes ago before he went to run several errands.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been so surprised to see me. He probably thought I had been
          bluffing when I said I would visit them, but I hadn't been bluffing. I
          loved babies; they were so precious. I hadn't held a lot, but the
          first time was when I worked at Julio's tattoo place in Mexico. One of
          his employees had a baby, and I was immediately attached to the little
          one. I always wanted to hold him whenever she brought him there, and
          sometimes, I would visit her apartment to spend time with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled at little Pia now, a beautiful name for a beautiful girl.
          They couldn't have given her something better than Pia. It was
          perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          "To think about it is crazy," Meredith said with a sigh as she dropped
          the soup spoon. "Siro and I never wanted a baby this early on in our
          marriage; we still wanted to have fun and enjoy our freedom, and I
          don't even know what in hell I'm doing; I don't know the first thing
          about being a mom, and Siro is as confused as me,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, taking the small visitor's couch by the side of the bed, "I
          think it's okay to feel that way; you learn as you go, honestly."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It would have been easier if my mom wasn't too angry to see me," she
          said, a sadness in her voice that had me looking up at her. Both sides
          of the family hadn't approved of her and Siro's marriage because they
          thought they weren't compatible, but they were in love and very crazy
          about each other, so none of those opinions mattered to them then.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your mom is missing the opportunity of a lifetime, Meredith. Trust me
          when I say she will regret it."
        </p>
        <p>
          She smiled a closed-lipped smile at me and then looked down at Pia in
          my arms. "She's so little. Each time I hold her, I get scared I'd
          crush her or something,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I chuckled, "You won't," I looked down at Pia, "It's only your
          thoughts messing with you. You'll be a wonderful mother, Meredith."
        </p>
        <p>"And so will you,"</p>
        <p>I snapped my head up to look at her. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          "You're perfect with Pia; I have no doubt you'll be a great mom too,"
          she said with a kind smile, "I'm sure Vitale would also be a wonderful
          dad, and you all will make a perfect family someday."
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile was a little forced as I nodded, not saying anything. My
          throat tightened as I watched Pia.
        </p>
        <p>"Did I say something wrong?"</p>
        <p>
          Without looking at her, I shook my head, "No, you're good. I'm just a
          little..." I swallowed the lump in my throat, shaking my head again as
          I looked up at her with a tight smile, "Never mind, it's nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
          She held a concerned look in her eyes, one that was inviting and warm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meredith was safe to talk to, but I wasn't a heart-to-heart kind of
          girl. I didn't really know how to do that stuff...at least, not with
          anyone aside from Milk, who I was very comfortable with, who I knew
          wouldn't judge me for the things I did or felt, and even if I wanted
          to talk now...what would I say? There was a lot on my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you want to talk," Meredith started softly, "I'm always here to
          listen. I mean...I don't have friends here in Sicily, I just...well,
          Siro is the only one I know here, and you...I know you're his boss,
          and this might seem odd, but we can still talk..."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled at her, looking down at Pia again and letting the silence
          drag on a little before I spoke my following words quietly. "I think I
          have a little bit of an identity crisis,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Saying the words aloud affirmed where my head was, and I felt a sense
          of relief, a little bag leaving my shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I closed my eyes, turned my head, and opened my eyes to stare
          at the white ceiling. "I don't know who I am...but I know what I want
          to be...although when I think about wanting to be that person...I
          feel...guilty."
        </p>
        <p>"Guilty in what sense?"</p>
        <p>
          I looked back at her but focused somewhere on her collarbone. "Guilty
          that I want to be happy...that I want to drop all I have ever known to
          pursue a safer life with the people I love and forget the old me
          existed." I clenched my jaw, "But the old me is...very, <i>very</i>,
          vengeful. She's tired of what she used to be, and she wants to make
          people pay for all that happened to her, and she wants it so bad she
          is willing to risk it all...but then there's the me stuck in the
          middle, trying to stop both identities from blending because I might
          lose myself completely. I might go batshit crazy, and I'm terrified of
          going batshit crazy."
        </p>
        <p>"Then maybe that's what you need?"</p>
        <p>
          I locked eyes with her, noticing the black depth of her eyes that
          complimented her black hair.
        </p>
        <p>"To go crazy?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          She laughed softly, "No...that's not what I meant. The middle you...is
          the <i>You</i> that you need to focus on. What does she really want?"
        </p>
        <p>"Both things,"</p>
        <p>
          "Good...we must learn to let the people we love see a side to us that
          we are scared to show or think they won't approve of. Give them a
          chance to stick with you or run for the hills. If they stick with you,
          great; if they don't, let them go; they'll either come around if
          they're the real ones or let you be if they aren't."
        </p>
        <p>"I don't want to risk losing them..."</p>
        <p>
          "We take risks in life, not because we want to...but because we need
          to. That's the only way we move forward. Risk is a necessity. I took
          it with Siro, and while I lost my family by choosing him, it was the
          best decision I ever made," she smiled, "Let it all in, Zahra, feel
          all the feelings that come with both sides of you, if you keep
          tiptoeing around them, and avoiding feeling them, you'll most
          definitely lose yourself in all the chaos."
        </p>
        <p>
          I let her words sink in. I didn't know how long I sat there, but I
          eventually smiled, said nothing, and looked back down at the baby in
          my arms.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          I stepped onto the boat's front deck lined at the docks; the
          sunglasses I wore shielded the sun from making me squint as the person
          I met stepped out of the cabin with a glass of champagne in his grip.
          "You are an hour late," he said, Russian accent touching all of his
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking around the area, I saw men hanging around, discretely guarding
          the boat without getting attention from the other passers and boat
          owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boat I was standing on was a new modern build named Vivian
          Yegorov, a white and newly constructed beauty that looked like an
          elite vacation home. It was owned by the buff man with a bald head and
          tattooed face standing by the cabin, wearing white shorts and a white
          unbuttoned shirt with a chest and stomach littered with tattoos; it
          was a struggle to find skin. He watched me. Yaroslav Yegorov. A very
          popular transporter—<i>smuggler</i>—of anything. Drugs, illegal food
          supplies, contraband, and, most times, important people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back at him through my sunglasses, "Something important came
          up," I said, slipping my phone into my pocket. "Nice boat,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He smirked proudly, "Yes. One of my priced possessions, named after
          the most important woman in my life...my mother."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, sure. Great. Do you have it?"</p>
        <p>He nodded, gesturing with his head that I followed him.</p>
        <p>
          Looking around once more, I followed behind him down a living space
          area that housed a couple of half-naked women and men sleeping on the
          couches with the evidence of what seemed to have been a wild party.
        </p>
        <p>
          We passed through to a short hallway, and then he stopped in front of
          a door, dug in his pocket for a bunch of keys, unlocked the door, and
          pushed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a simple bedroom, empty, safe for a single couch and a single
          bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The item I had come for was tied to the single couch in front of the
          bed, brown greying hair a wild mess, dried blood running down his
          face, with a white cloth tied around his mouth to prevent him from
          making any noise that might raise suspicions, he was dressed
          corporately, a white button up and black slacks, no suit in sight. He
          had probably been returning from an event when they snagged him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man looked between me and Yaroslav with a confused frown on his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>"The blood?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"He fought too hard. Killed two of my guys in the process,"</p>
        <p>I nodded, "Give us the room,"</p>
        <p>
          Yaroslav nodded, walking out of the room and shutting the door after
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took off my sunglasses, hooking them to the middle neckline of my
          waistcoat as I walked around him to remove the cloth from his mouth
          that had stopped him from speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know you are gonna die for this, right?" was his first gruff
          words to me as I threw the cloth to a corner, came to stand in front
          of him, shoved both hands into my pants pocket, and tilted my head as
          I watched him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The last thing you would want to threaten me with is death. It does
          nothing for me. Death is like a...been there, done that kinda topic
          for me? So, maybe try something else,"
        </p>
        <p>"Who the fuck are you?"</p>
        <p>
          "No one of importance...but you, on the other hand..." I smiled, "You
          are a really hard man to find, Tora Vuković,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe that's because I'm not supposed to be fucking found?" he
          yelled. "Do you know the kind of problems you have caused for the CIA,
          bringing me in like this? They'll know something is wrong when I don't
          report back,"
        </p>
        <p>"No, they won't...I have that covered, Agent Vuković."</p>
        <p>He paused. "What the hell do you mean by that?"</p>
        <p>
          I shrugged, "In the movie industries, there's something they call a
          stunt double."
        </p>
        <p>
          The look in his eyes turned lethal, "You bring a civilian to handle
          private governmental business?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, shush, grandpa, he's a professional," I stopped, then blinked, "I
          think...for the most part, I don't know, he was recommended to me. But
          I know he won't fuck it up because then he'd have me to deal with, and
          most people don't want to deal with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          The man was breathing loudly now, looking pissed beyond belief. "What
          do you want? Who are you? Why the fuck am I here?"

          "You have information that I want...Information I must get for a good
          friend of mine."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are wasting your time, Miss. I work for the fucking CIA;
          everything in my head is high-profiled shit I can't divulge; you might
          as well kill me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled yet again, walking to stand behind him, "There are worse
          things than death, Agent Vuković. I really don't want us to go down
          that route," I placed my hand on both his shoulders, bending slowly so
          my lips were to his ear. "It would do you a lot of good to cooperate
          with me so I don't bring the people you care about into this," I said
          softly, but there was a menacing edge to my voice that I didn't bother
          to hide.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rose to my full height and walked back in front of him to see the
          anger and wariness in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that I have your attention, you're going to tell me all you know
          about Jared and Sandra Reagan."
        </p>
        <p>His face paled. "Wh—what? Where did you hear those names?"</p>
        <p>"I believe they are parents to my best friend, Wesley Reagan."</p>
        <p>
          His eyes widened. "Jesus..." He gasped out. I didn't like the level of
          surprise I saw in his eyes and heard in his voice. "Wesley's
          <i>alive?</i>"
        </p>
        <p>
          Alarm bells rang in my head as I slipped my hand behind me, pulled out
          my gun, unlocked it from the safety, and pointed it right at him,
          "Okay motherfucker, start talking,"

        <p>_______<br /><b>ELIO</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p><b>HER PERFECTLY </b>symmetrical face stared lifelessly at me.</p>
        <p>An indubitably amorous masterpiece.</p>
        <p>The perfect aphrodisiac.</p>
        <p>
          She was a work of art with all careful strokes and colors, months,
          weeks, and days of hard work, learning and perfecting how to use a
          paintbrush, letting out my frustrations and obsession on a blank
          canvas to feel less preoccupied in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcome had rattled me, but it had worked...I managed my urges. I
          managed my feelings and emotions to the point that whenever I began to
          feel a little deeply, I expressed it through this means...
        </p>
        <p>All for what?</p>
        <p>
          An obsession that was pulsing right in front of my eyes, in my veins,
          in my blood...one that had me thinking infernal thoughts I certainly
          wanted to put into action but couldn't because I <i>had</i> to be this
          way...I had to be healed, and...<i>okay</i>...and perfect...perfect so
          my brother wouldn't have to worry about me, so he wouldn't have to see
          me crack and go—how did he put it—<i>berserk</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My life now was an awful lot like how I tiptoed around my father,
          doing things a certain way so he wouldn't know I wasn't all right in
          the head—denying myself happiness because I wanted to live up to his
          expectations. However, this time, the people I cared for wanted me to
          conform to their idea of happiness...although to their credit, the
          concepts of happiness they had were good—better than my idea, which
          was a little sideways. Still, it felt so good to think my thoughts, to
          imagine how happy I would feel putting into action the pictures that
          flipped in my head right now...staring at this portrait of Zahra.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt terrific...picturing myself slicing Zahra's fiancé's neck—the
          fiancé who <i>mattered</i>—Not after giving him a month's worth of
          torture, taking him to a cabin out of a town that had only four
          hundred residents, knowing no one would come out there for months, and
          by chance when his body started decaying, no one would be disturbed by
          the smell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe I would take pictures...make several videos, kidnap Zahra, and
          make her watch it on repeat until she went crazy...as crazy as she
          made me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I'd probably buy a ring and burn it into the skin of her ring
          finger so it would permanently remain etched to her skin and bones. I
          would most definitely do the same thing to myself, too...generous
          enough to go through the pain with her because I love her, and her
          pain was mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I would buy her the prettiest wedding dress and hold a gun to her
          head as she said the vows, after which I would take her home and lock
          her up until I make her fall in love with me and remember how amazing
          it was for the both of us, being together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought the bottle of bourbon to my lips, taking a very long swig
          and drinking like it was water...all the while never removing my eyes
          from the portrait.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could really do it...I should probably start making plans; it
          wouldn't take me too much to find her fiancé; he had many enemies I
          was friends with...I had so many plans for him...I wondered what face
          he would make while he chewed on his own fingers...the fingers he had
          around Zahra in those pictures...I reckon he would house a grimace and
          try to seem strong while he ate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thinking about it made me eager...it would also be <i>fun</i> to have
          Zahra at the table to watch...I wouldn't let her eat his fi—
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, shaking my head off the thoughts and frowning at myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you thinking?" I said aloud. "You have finally gone mad.
          Those are disgusting thoughts...could you even go through with it? I
          could...but do I go through with it? What would Elia think of me? He
          would probably come up with a better word than berserk...maybe
          something more hurtful, like...demented? Hm. Bonkers? Unhinged?
          Unstable...Not love material...suffocating."
        </p>
        <p>I chuckled.</p>
        <p>
          "Suffocating. He would say that...he did tell me I was overbearing
          once. Overbearing, suffocating...not much difference between those two
          words." I brought the bottle to my lips again, drinking because I had
          somehow, <i>miraculously</i>, run out of cigars.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Running out of cigars...never happened before, but then I let people
          in, and they grow concerned, and they touch my things, and I have to
          be okay with it because that is what a normal person would be...okay
          with it because I am trying to be normal, and wasn't normal
          before...just like my mother, and now me...tiptoeing...tiptoeing
          around my own house...my own space...acting...acting—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone cleared their throat behind me, and I blinked, clamping my
          mouth shut before turning toward the door to see Alizea leaning by it
          with a concerned frown.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey," her smile was careful.</p>
        <p>
          "Hello," I turned back to the portrait. "Did not know you were home,"
        </p>
        <p>"Facetime with Riley," she answered.</p>
        <p>"Hm."</p>
        <p>
          "Elia told me you haven't left this room since you returned from
          Sicily...made me wonder if you've had dinner yet?"
        </p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I figured..." She went quiet for a while, and I knew she was
          still watching me; my fingers tapped on the bottle in my grip,
          clanking sounds coming from my rings. "You were mumbling to yourself
          just now," she spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped, my fingers halting midair, before I turned on the stool to
          regard her. "That was not...audible?"
        </p>
        <p>She smiled sadly. "I could barely hear a word you were saying,"</p>
        <p>
          "Ah..." I nodded, "Well, it was nothing. I was analyzing the" I
          gestured to the portrait. "portrait. I was thinking of redoing it,
          making it more vibrant in color...happier, but with the same idea. My
          therapist says speaking the ideas out loud sometimes helps as
          a...buffer for speaking in the mind. I cannot remember the exact way
          he phrased it."
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, believing the lie. "That is good; I like the portrait. I'd
          love to see the one with more colors, though."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. Me too. Colors tell stories; it is incredible when you take your
          time to think about it." I spoke. "I never used to see the stories in
          colors. My father always preferred black...and I grew up following
          that pattern. I still love black; it is comfortable, and though I do
          not like involving other colors in what I wear, I can at least
          experiment with how lovely they look on a blank canvas."
        </p>
        <p>She smiled. "That is beautiful,"</p>
        <p>"It is indeed."</p>
        <p>
          I heard her footsteps tread cautiously into the space, and my gaze
          shifted to watch her walk by me to another abandoned canvas to my
          left. She ran her fingers on the dried paint of what was becoming the
          beginning process of a landscape.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm guessing it didn't go well...seeing Zahra?"</p>
        <p>
          The sudden rise of the burn in my chest had me clenching my jaw and
          looking away from her. "It was not far from what I expected."
        </p>
        <p>
          I could tell she was looking at me now. "Do you want to talk about
          it?"
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "Okay." from my periphery, I caught her glancing at the portrait I was
          looking at and then at me. "Do you...want to talk...generally? It's
          better than mumbling and being in here all by yourself...drinking.
          It's been almost eight hours, Elio,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised the drink to my lips, a breath away from downing its content
          before I paused, waited a few beats, and then dropped the bottle with
          a sigh. I remained quiet, staring at the portrait, my eyes taking in
          the strokes of her short hair covering a side of her face, the
          contours of her closed eyelids, and the little smile I had given the
          visible side of her lips...then my gaze went trailing down and down to
          her shoulders and cleavage where the painting cut off. It felt like I
          had filled something up inside and sated my longing for a while by
          drinking in her image; my chest felt heavy...with love—strained love,
          haunting confusion, and maddening frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked, forcing down a swallow to allow my words come out without
          breaking. "I am trying to work up the courage to burn every portrait I
          made of her. As pathetic as it might sound, I need the liquid courage,
          so I know what to blame when I wake up tomorrow."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It won't work." She said, and I looked up to see her picking another
          stool from the side and pulling it towards me to sit. "You're aware of
          why you're drinking...and when you wake up, you'll be aware of
          everything you did, and you'll feel worse, trust me...I've been
          there."
        </p>
        <p>I frowned in question.</p>
        <p>
          "Riley's Dad. When we separated." She said, dragging in a long breath
          and letting it out. "I was buried in regret. I hated him but hated
          myself more for not fighting for what we had. He's still in Riley's
          life...here and there, but I knew it would have been better if I had
          gotten my shit together, if I had been there for him, for our family.
          When I realized everything was messed up...I...I wanted to burn it
          all: our pictures, our memories. I did...but it made me feel worse and
          terrible. I know our situation isn't the same, and I don't know
          exactly what happened with Zahra, but...the memories you both have
          together won't disappear the moment you burn those portraits."
        </p>
        <p>I looked down at the bottle in my hand.</p>
        <p>"Neither would drinking," she added.</p>
        <p>"I'm aware."</p>
        <p>"So why put yourself through the hurt this way?"</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "Differentiating logic and emotions from everything
          that happened today is difficult. I know her." I bit the inside of my
          lips, "I know she was only trying to push me away, but...someone who
          loves you would never say...hurtful things...unless they are true. I
          am trying to understand if it is indeed true if I am indeed
          suffocating," I looked up at her, "Am I? Do you find me suffocating?"
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head. "I don't,"</p>
        <p>
          "Then do you think—do you think if things were different between us,
          like say if we were more than friends...do you see me as someone you
          could fall in love with? Do you think I am love material?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her smile was sad and knowing. "If that were the case, falling in love
          with you would be easy, Elio. I am sure she didn't mean to say that to
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know," I looked down, my thumb finger grazing the brand writings on
          the bottle, "But it doesn't erase the fact that she did say it. Zahra
          has said many...<i> many hurtful</i> things to me in the past, but
          somehow, none of them ever hurt me the way this one did. She was the
          one who made me feel like I was capable of love and of being loved,
          and now she says this...and," I swallowed. "It is confusing; I have
          never been so confused, Ali. I do not know what to believe; I do not
          even know how to be angry at her; I'm just hurt...hurt that even
          thinking of her hurt, and I do not want it to hurt when I think of her
          because I always want to think of her."
        </p>
        <p>I ran my fingers through my hair.</p>
        <p>
          "I cannot even bring myself to wish I never met her because she was my
          saving grace; she made me see the light when it was so dark inside of
          me; she saved me, Ali...without her, I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't be
          this person I am today. But for some reason, this woman won't let me
          in; she won't let me return the favor; rather, she would hurt me. She
          would lie to me, and push me away, and It is so, so frustrating."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe you—"</p>
        <p>
          "Frustrating to the point that I am thinking of kidnapping her, and
          talking to her...<i>actually</i> talking to her, opening her stubborn
          head and arranging my words inside it. So she would listen to me, and
          I would listen to her, and we would communicate...and settle this
          because I cannot live without her, and I cannot be here with the
          knowledge that she is there, hurting because she can't bring herself
          to rely on me." I let out a long breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence stretched between us, and I glanced at her before looking
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I apologize," I said after a while, "I said I didn't want to talk
          about it,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no, it's okay, you clearly wanted to." she smiled. "I'm not your
          therapist, but I'm your friend; I'm always here to listen."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," I said, "Aside from being frustrated about this whole
          thing. I am angry at her. I don't think I want to speak to her. For
          now, I think I want to leave her alone."
        </p>
        <p>"You're giving up?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know," I said, and it scared me how much that thought seemed
          to be at the forefront of my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving up on Zahra...it was an alienish thought, but I knew I had to
          step back. If I didn't, I feared every thought I had of kidnapping her
          and her fiancé would seize from being thoughts. They would become
          actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It hurt this much when she pretended to hate me; I deduced it would
          hurt more if she genuinely harbored such feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I say you do whatever you feel is right for you. But...if you
          are certain she didn't entirely mean all she said, then...keep a door
          open. You can be angry and want to give her space, but keep a door
          open."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, shaking my head. "I couldn't even close it if I tried, Ali.
          That is how lost I am for that woman."
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>It was almost 4 AM when I settled in bed after a bath.</p>
        <p>
          With alcohol still in my system, the emotional stress I had gone
          through, avoiding a discussion with my brother because that was
          another issue I didn't want to break down at the moment—that and the
          fact that I had subconsciously gotten into my mind again, mumbling to
          myself and losing sense of all that was around me, I knew sleep
          wouldn't be hard to find.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mind replayed the conversation again; her words echoed in my head
          whenever her face flashed in my mind. My anger was still there, my
          hurt was ever present, and the burn of my decision to give it...<i
            >time and stay away</i
          >
          raged on.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought I had been avoiding, though, was the engagement. She had
          said it was already in the works before we even met...she said he
          mattered to her...why would she start something as intimate as all we
          had while being promised to someone else? She might be slightly bent
          in morals, but Zahra was not a perfidious lover...besides, I had met
          Vitale, and he hadn't seemed bothered about her relationship with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could the engagement be a farce? If it was, then a farce for what? Why
          would they enter into something as intricate as an engagement?
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, reaching for my phone beside me with the intention of
          staring at the wallpaper again—like I always did, lost in my thoughts
          about her...where she was, and if she was all right. Now that I knew
          she was all right, I was sure my thoughts would be centered more
          on...Why she was engaged, and why she needed me gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning on the screen, I was greeted with a wincing brightness I still
          hadn't learned to shield myself from and several missed calls—14
          missed calls, to be exact—a few text messages and a voice mail.
        </p>
        <p>All from...Zahra.</p>
        <p>
          I frowned, slowly sitting up with the device hard in my grip. I was a
          little intoxicated, but I knew I wasn't imagining it.
        </p>
        <p>She had unblocked my number.</p>
        <p>Called me.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>It took me a while to comprehend the new change of events.</p>

        <p>
          Attached were pictures from odd angles...pictures of me and her
          talking by the side of the road. It was blurry and a bit grainy, but I
          had been there, so I knew the scene.

        </p>
        <p><i>1:14 AM</i></p>
        <p>That was the last message she sent.</p>
        <p>
          The voicemail was sent much earlier, by four in the afternoon, and the
          first call was a few minutes earlier.
        </p>
        <p>The last call was only thirty minutes ago.</p>
        <p>
          I clicked on the voicemail, and her voice filled the space around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Hi, it's me." </i>she stopped for what seemed like a minute; I
          could hear the distant chatters in her background.
          <i
            >"I know you probably don't want to hear from me now, but I...I need
            to talk to you again...to—to redo the whole, the whole conversation

            deserve more than that. I'm in Milan now. I arrived a few minutes
            ago at a small restaurant near the compound...I just texted and
            shared my location with you. I know you moved from the compound, but
            I have no idea where you live now...If you...if you don't want to
            come to me, then I can come to you; give me your address, and I'll
            be there,"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Another pause.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"I'm sorry...for everything I said. I didn't mean them...I was only
            scared that someone would see...and it was all for fucking nothing
            because someone </i
          >did<i>
            see, and I...I realized it was foolish, pushing you away from a
            picture you're in."
          </i>
          A shaky breath and then,
          <i
            >"I know you had nothing to do with the MCSS; I understand now. I've
            known for quite a while. That's why it didn't matter if you

            sorry, Elio. I'll explain everything...the engagement,
            everything...just, just pick up the phone...let's meet...please." </i
          >another pause.
          <i
            >"I know I'm not great at this...I never was; it's hard because I
            don't know what I'm doing half the time, but I swear, I'll do
            better, and I'll try...I'll learn how to be like I should be with
            you...because—because believe it or not, as mushy as it sounds,
            you're everything to me too."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Her breathing came through the line, and I could picture her holding
          the phone tight and closing her eyes, trying not to let on too much.
          <i
            >"I lied; you're the most lovable person I've ever met in my entire
            existence. You have your moments, but you're too good, even for me.

            love material, trust me...I would know."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>The mail ended there. My room was quiet again.</p>
        <p>
          It was now 4 AM, and if she called thirty minutes ago...she might
          still be there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scrolled up to where she had shared her location. It was still on,
          and she was still at the restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>I pressed my teeth on my tongue. Hard.</p>
        <p>My head ransacked itself for a decision.</p>
        <p>
          Every fiber in my being was telling me to go to her, like I always
          did, like I wanted to...but I sighed, pressing the side button of my
          phone until a toggle to turn it off appeared on the screen. Hesitating
          a second's breath, I swiped it and watched the device go off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dropped the phone on the side table, and turned off my bedside lamp
          before settling on the bed, closed my eyes, and called it a night.

        <p>
          <b>I DRY </b>heaved into the toilet as my phone vibrated outside the
          stall.
        </p>
        <p>
          My shaky hands gripped both sides of the toilet seat as I tried to
          cough out the nausea swirling in my stomach with a sickening turn. The
          efforts I put into that task alone worsened the thunderous headache
          pounding in my head and hurting both my eyes to the point that I
          couldn't pull them open completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two days without alcohol in my system. It was safe to say this wasn't
          the worst withdrawal symptom I'd ever had. One would think I'd rip off
          the bandage and go through it once without relapsing. But I always
          succumbed to the pull. Not because I was weak but because I had shit
          to do, and I couldn't be sick while carrying out those things.
        </p>
        <p>As delusional as all of that bullshit sounded, it was the truth.</p>
        <p>
          I expelled a breath, realizing for the third time now that there was
          nothing for me to throw up. I hadn't eaten anything since I left the
          mansion this morning, refusing to eat the breakfast Aurora had
          prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew she would either be worried sick about my absence or be
          disappointed knowing I had failed to return home for dinner after the
          big feast she would have prepared, knowing I hadn't had anything to
          eat all day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tugged down the flush handle, the sound of rushing water filling the
          space as I rose to my feet and exited the stall, stumbling a little
          when a rush of dizziness claimed me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood still, counting from ten to one, measuring my breaths and the
          blurriness of my vision as it zoomed from blurry to clear. When I was
          sure I wasn't at risk of falling to my face, I moved to the sinks,
          flicking up the faucet and washing my hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze flickered to my reflection in the mirror, meeting the dark
          circles around my eyes. I had long since removed my hair from the
          ponytail it was in; now, it was loose around my shoulders. I could see
          the tiredness weakening my bones and the regret making my face seem
          wan...or maybe it was the sickness weakening my system.
        </p>
        <p>
          My phone vibrated for the—I'd lost count—time since I left Sicily. I
          glanced at it, seeing Vitale's name on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed, turning off the water and drying my hands with a towel
          before digging through my purse, fingers brushing past keys, lip balm,
          and sunglasses, before grabbing the transparent orange case filled
          with bright yellow pills, which helped kill the headaches most times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shuffled three of the pills onto my palm, throwing them in my mouth
          and swallowing dry. I wondered the kind of effect they would have on
          my system, seeing as I was swallowing strong pills on an empty
          stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe I would ask the restaurant staff to fix something for me so I
          wouldn't pass out while waiting for Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dropping the case back into my bag, I lifted it and grabbed my phone
          before exiting the restaurant's restroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd been here since about 3 PM and paid for a single overnight
          service. It was a ridiculous amount of money because the owner was
          very reluctant, but I needed to make sure the place was open in case
          Elio hadn't seen my messages and missed calls on time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew he was fond of going places without his phone...so maybe that
          was why he hadn't shown up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delusional. That was the correct definition to associate with my
          current status. Deep down, I knew I didn't deserve his audience. It
          was foolish to think he would come, but I knew I still had to try.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been so foolish to think keeping him away would be for the best.
          I thought I could finish all I had been working months for and return
          to him...I thought I could cut all marital ties with Vitale; maybe
          Elio would never even have to find out about the engagement because it
          was nothing—but I had been wrong to think I could pull it off...that I
          could eat my cake and have it. My luck could only run so far,
          honestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Vitale had sent those pictures to me with a very expressive
          follow-up of <i>"What the fuck am I looking at?"</i> I knew trying to
          put Elio at arm's length was pointless. I knew everything I had said
          to him by that roadside was for nothing because all I was avoiding had
          happened either way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't know or care about how Vitale explained or handled the
          situation with those pictures; all I knew was that I had to see Elio
          despite the risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had hurt him, pulled us further apart, and I couldn't do that to
          him...to us. The distance and the space just weren't worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I acted without thinking, an impulsive decision based on false
          pro-activeness and fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meredith had been right about many things, and I had been foolish and
          probably am still foolish for coming here without thinking because
          whoever took those pictures didn't take them for good press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somebody was watching. I didn't precisely know who. Or what for, but
          my biggest guess was the society...they were the only enemies I could
          think of.
        </p>
        <p>Still, a lot didn't make sense.</p>
        <p>
          Why did they send us the pictures in the first place? If they wanted
          to use it to make a case on the table, questioning my relationship
          with Vitale, why hadn't they called an emergency meeting and slammed
          it in our faces? Why give us a chance to salvage the situation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless that wasn't what they were aiming for? They had sent the images
          to Vitale and not me. It was safe to say he had been furious...had the
          sender wished to cause issues in my relationship with him? Create a
          rift in our united front? Make him break off the engagement?
        </p>
        <p>
          I hadn't had much time to dwell on those thoughts because I had been
          leaving Yegorov's boat when his messages came in, and gears had been
          turning in my head. I knew I had to lock all my worries into a box I
          couldn't reach and make sure Elio and I talked things out before the
          end of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cared less about why those pictures were sent or taken and more
          about how I would rectify everything with Elio. Letting him know that
          he was a part of this picture, that I was sick for saying he wasn't
          love material because I love him, and he was at the center of all I
          could think about since I woke up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed; flexing my neck muscles, I walked back to the booth I had
          occupied since I arrived at the restaurant that afternoon. I looked
          towards where the single staff member who volunteered to stay
          overnight for extra cash had been standing, and I frowned when I
          couldn't find him behind the counter, swiping through his phone like
          he had been doing all morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around the quiet space; only two lights were lit., one
          overhead the counter and the other close to my booth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I settled inside the booth, dropping my bag beside me and relaxing on
          the soft chair as a yawn left me; at the same time, my phone started
          vibrating again.
        </p>
        <p>Vitale.</p>
        <p>
          I groaned, declined the call, and saw that it was twenty minutes past
          five in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>It was apparent Elio wouldn't be showing up.</p>
        <p>
          The headache had calmed a little, but another ache remained, heavy
          against my chest, as I recalled the look on Elio's face before he
          turned away from me and left without another word.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked like I had broken him in two; he looked disappointed in
          me...tired of me. He hadn't even argued; he had turned away before I
          could see if he genuinely bought my bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat upright, picked up my phone, and swiped it open before
          navigating to his message box to see if he had checked the messages I
          had—
        </p>
        <p>"Oh,"</p>
        <p>
          My heart sank...sank and slipped down the walls of my stomach, leaving
          its bloody imprints as it fell while my eyes perused the automated
          words below the last message I sent.
        </p>
        <p><i>Read an hour ago</i>.</p>
        <p>This was it.</p>
        <p>
          This was that time I had feared—the time when he had enough of my
          bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still...still, I began typing another message even though my
          fingers felt tired, even though my hands were shaking and I was
          blinking back, tears and fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>I typed, and I deleted. Typed and deleted.</p>
        <p>I wasn't stupid; I knew nothing I said would be enough...</p>
        <p>I had really done it this time.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Stupid mouth. Stupid fucking brain of stupid shits, Zahra. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck," I whispered the curse to myself, dropping my phone and
          covering my face with my hands as I dragged it up to my hair, digging
          the heels of my palm into my eyes as if to press the tear stings back
          inside. Still, the torturing hotness enveloped my chest, and it was
          already hurting before I could try to control my feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swiped over to my contact list, scrolling until I saw Devil's
          contact. I had called him several times, wanting to know the address
          to their new place, but he hadn't picked up, nor had he responded to
          my texts. He, too, left me on read hours ago, but it hadn't hurt as
          much as this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was pretty sure Elio had listened to my voice mail...he wouldn't
          read the text and not listen to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          About to click on Devil's contact again, Vitale's call came in, and I
          swiped right furiously.
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck do you want?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Where are you?" </i>came the very calm but angry voice of my
          fiancé.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you want, Vitale? Stop blowing up my fucking phone, I'm
          fine."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Where, the hell, are you, Zahra, if you don't start talking, I
            swear to God—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Milan...some restaurant in Milan."</p>
        <p><i>"Have you gone mad?" </i></p>
        <p>
          "I think so; I don't feel dandy, so there's a chance I might have
          finally lost it. Is that all you wanted to know because I'm busy, and
          I want to hang up,"
        </p>
        <p>
          A strangled groan erupted from the other end of the line, and the
          sound of a door closing met my ears,
          <i>"Do you know, how dangerous it is being out there?" </i>
        </p>
        <p>"It's Marino territory, no one can start shit, I'm fine."</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Are you—"</i> he stopped, and I heard nothing for a few minutes,
          almost like he was counting his breath, and then,
          <i
            >"Not a couple of hours ago, some creep sent me pictures of you and
            your boy toy on the highway. Tracking the number that sent the

            couldn't tolerate anyone spying on you. I made them swear on society

          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't someone from the board..." worry fleshed inside me.</p>

          <i
            >"Right. It wasn't, and now you are out there...on your own in a

            stalker on your ass. What were you thinking?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit the inside of my lips, my leg bouncing rapidly, as I glanced at
          the counter.
        </p>
        <p>The staff still hadn't returned.</p>
        <p>
          "I wasn't thinking...I needed to see him, Vitale...I can't wait until
          some stupid event. I—I said some fucked up shit, and I needed to
          apologize and tell him everything."
        </p>
        <p>He went quiet, but I still heard him breathing.</p>
        <p>"Vit—"</p>
        <p><i>"You should have told me. I would have come with you—" </i></p>
        <p>
          I scoffed, "No offense or anything, but you're the last person he
          would want to see with me."
        </p>
        <p><i>"It's not safe, Zahra—" </i></p>
        <p>
          "I don't care...I don't care anymore, Vitale. It's never safe, it will
          probably never be safe for me, and I can't push everyone away forever
          because I want to keep them safe; it doesn't and wouldn't ever change
          anything."
        </p>
        <p><i>"And did he show up? Is he there with you?" </i></p>
        <p>
          Hesitating and falling back on the chair, I closed my eyes and
          answered. "No."
        </p>
        <p><i>"This is what I've been telling—" </i></p>
        <p>
          "He had every right not to show up, Vitale." I opened my eyes, staring
          at the ceiling, "I hurt him. I'm not worth him showing up. I've messed
          up with him too much, and I won't even blame him if he decides to cut
          all ties with me because I projected my shit onto him." I looked down
          at the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Everything I said to him today...every damn thing was me talking
          about myself. <i>I</i>am suffocating, and I hate everything happening
          around me. Waking up in the morning and seeing my reflection, I desire
          to shred it off because I don't even recognize myself anymore. I am
          toxic and foolish and most definitely a hazard to be with. He just has
          to wake up one morning and realize that he never really did love me
          because <i>I</i> am not love material. Not with everything I've been
          through..."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Don't speak that way about yourself, you hear you're your past
            doesn't define you,"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sadly, it does...I wasn't born to be loved, Vitale. I was born to be
          used. I'm body parts. Maybe that's why I mess up everything good in my
          life because I know deep down I don't deserve it. Elio deserves
          someone better, and me being here, waiting for him, is just selfish,
          but what can I do, Vitale? I can't...I don't think I can lose him
          because if I do, I, I don't know." A tear slid down my cheek, but I
          was quick to wipe it off, "If I lose him, it would mean I'm right. It
          would mean I wasn't made to be loved...only sexually desired, and I
          can't...I can't stomach that thought because I really do love him,
          and..." I trailed off, sniffing and wiping my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence was at the other end of the line, but it was soon cut off by
          the softness of Vitale's voice in my ear, "<i
            >Where is the restaurant you're at? I'll come to Milan—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I'm good; I'm okay. I'll wait till it's morning...maybe...maybe
          he'll change his mind and come to see if I'm still here,"
        </p>
        <p><i>"Zahra for the love of God—"</i></p>
        <p>"Nothing you say will make me change my mind."</p>
        <p><i>"Your safety—" </i></p>
        <p>"Try to get some sleep, Vitale."</p>
        <p><i>"Wait, don't you dare—" </i></p>
        <p>
          I hung up, placing my phone on silent and slipping it into my bag.
          Wiping the fresh tears and blinking back the ones rising in my eyes, I
          tried to press down on the hurt residing in my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't a crier...but when it came to Elio, controlling my emotions
          was next to impossible. It was as annoying as it was pathetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to level my breathing, I looked out the window, allowing the
          passing of 5 AM drivers rushing to their various destinations, lull me
          into a serenity my head wasn't willing to give me. I stared for a
          while, letting the silence calm me until a small noise from towards
          the counter had me looking up again; I saw the...now ashen staff
          rounding the counter with a cup filled with what looked like orange
          juice.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he came closer, I noticed two things: it was indeed orange juice,
          but iced, and his hands...his hands were shaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat upright with a frown when he reached me, a tight smile on his
          face as he dropped the drink in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>"Um..." I started, "I didn't order anything..."</p>
        <p>
          "It's on the house; I-I noticed you...that the—the person you wanted
          to meet here didn't show up, and you look quite well—not all right, I
          just—I thought I would fix up something for you...something chill."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked. "Oh, that's...nice...thank you." I eyed him. "Are you
          good?"
        </p>
        <p>"Sleep deprived," he shrugged, "but the pay is worth it."</p>
        <p>
          My smile was apologetic. "I'm sorry...I know you're being paid,
          but—it's still my fault that it had to be this way."
        </p>
        <p>"It's okay—all good. I'll um...get back to it,"</p>
        <p>"Sure," I managed a calm smile, "And thanks again for the drink."</p>
        <p>
          He glanced briefly at the said drink and then at me before nodding and
          walking off briskly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him walk back to the counter, settling on a stool and taking
          out his phone to resume scrolling. Looking back at my table, I pulled
          the drink towards me, absentmindedly mixing the ice and the juice with
          the straw, before placing it in my mouth and sucking in the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cold, fruity, calming bliss met my tongue, and I melted. The remnant
          of the headache in my head slipped right away. It tasted like heaven,
          and the chillness of the drink somehow eased my nausea. I drank and
          drank, feeling my stomach muscles relax.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pulled back, sighing and placing my hand on my cheek, wondering how
          I got here. How I let it all get to this point...my relationship with
          Elio and all of STREET.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I told Vitale was true; I had pushed them all away to protect
          them from my world. Every member of STREET had their potential. They
          had dreams they wanted to fulfill individually. Milk wanted to open a
          store and expand her circle of friends, Upper wanted to go back to
          school, Dog wished to join the FBI and find out what happened to his
          parents, and Devil wanted to spend time with his family, seeing as he
          had spent years away from Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Me? I wanted to bring down the filthy organization trafficking
          children like it was the new normal. Organization funded by several
          governmental bodies, all operating under the biggest names in politics
          and the criminal world.
        </p>
        <p>
          STREET deserved a normal life...at least, that was what I thought when
          I decided to disband the group. I had already messed up, leaving them
          underground abandoning my best friend when I saw he was in active
          danger. I knew that was a better time than any to let them all go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had brought us together as the perfect mock-up for my goals, but I
          had unknowingly created a family that changed me, showed me the true
          version of myself, and showed me that I could be better if I chose to
          be. But I had torn that apart too...tore it apart to protect
          them...and maybe to protect myself...the little dignity I had left.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was afraid of what they'd think of me if I happened to tell them
          about my past. I knew how long it took me to tell Elio. I knew what I
          had to suppress when I bore everything out to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew everything that happened in my past wasn't my fault, but the
          things I had to do and endure didn't stop me from feeling ashamed
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought the straw to my lips again, drinking more of the juice and
          frowning when it burned my throat a little. I swallowed, a sudden
          tiredness weakening my limbs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blinking, I tried to sit up, but my body felt heavy...heavy to the
          point that even my vision grew blurry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, gaze dropping to the wobbly drink before me and then to the
          staff who now stood ramrod by the counter, eyes directly trained
          toward my booth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shi..." My head dropped on the table with a loud thud as I tried to
          fight the dizziness, but I was losing, losing badly. I couldn't feel
          my palms, feet, or body; I wasn't in control, and the moment I let my
          eyes fall close, I was zapped into darkness.
        </p>

            close to you...the first time I," his gloved thumb finger brushed my

            turning away from him, but he snapped my head back towards his with
            my chin, "First time I tasted your lips," his hand moved to grope my
            left breast. "first time I touched you..."

          </i>
        </p>
        <p>My eyes snapped open, and I was upright with a gasp.</p>
        <p>
          I was heaving, sweating, and confused when I spotted the light from
          the window flooding into my bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>Wait a second...</p>
        <p>
          I looked around me frantically, my eyes taking in the dull
          environment. The red walls, crimson rug...double oak doors...
        </p>
        <p>My bedroom...in Sicily.</p>
        <p>I was...</p>
        <p>"What the fuck?"</p>
        <p>
          I looked down, seeing I was in my red silk night shorts and dress,
          with my robe around me.
        </p>
        <p>"What the hell..."</p>
        <p>
          My bedroom door burst open, and my head snapped up to see Vitale's
          eyes blazing with anger. "You have the fucking nerve," he seethed.
        </p>
        <p>I blinked, confused, "What?"</p>
        <p>"Do you think it was funny?"</p>
        <p>
          Watching him with my head still fogged, I dragged myself out of the
          bed on my feet. "What are you talking—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "All morning, since you hung up on me, I've been trying to fucking
          call you! I had to fly to fucking Milan!"
        </p>
        <p>"Wait—wait, I was in—"</p>
        <p>
          "I get it if you didn't want to talk to me, but a simple text would
          have sufficed; I was worried about you!"
        </p>
        <p>"I <i>was</i> in Milan...I never left Milan,"</p>
        <p>His angry eyes turned confused. "What are you talking about?"</p>
        <p>
          "I...I never left; I was in the restaurant and then...and then I'm
          here, I—"
        </p>
        <p>"You drank again, didn't you,"</p>
        <p>I recoiled, "No, I didn't—"</p>
        <p>
          He sighed, exasperated, "Zahra, you can't do things like this," he
          stepped closer to me, "You're not allowed to do things like this, not
          when I'm not within reach."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know...I'm sorry, but...but I don't know what happened, I wasn't—I
          don't know how I got here, I—I'm missing time."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You need to get help. This is...I don't know how much you drank last
          night, but...but if it continues like this, to the point you can't
          recall things, maybe you should—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't drink. Yes, I was tempted, but...but I held out, I—I held it
          out, and I—believe me, Vitale. I was in the restaurant, you'd just
          called, and I hung up and silenced my phone, and—and I got this drink
          from the staff, and that's all I can remember. I swear to you; it was
          orange fucking juice. No alcohol,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He eyed me, detecting the cluelessness in my voice, but then his eyes
          hardened again. "You wouldn't know; you were probably passed out when
          you arrived last night—"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't even remember arriving, Vitale!"</p>
        <p>"Exactly! You don't fucking remember, that's what alcohol does!"</p>
        <p>"But I—"</p>
        <p>
          The sound of my phone blaring from the bedside broke off our argument.
          With one glance at him, I turned and walked to the bedside table,
          picking up the phone and freezing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked over at Vitale, whose gaze dropped to the phone and then me,
          his eyebrows raised in question.
        </p>
        <p>"It's Elio," I said.</p>
        <p>Vitale's jaw locked, his frown deepening.</p>
        <p>
          Turning from him, I swiped, accepting the call and placing the phone
          against my ear.
        </p>
        <p>"Hi..."</p>
        <p><i>"Are you still in Milan?" </i></p>
        <p>
          I pressed my eyes shut, grinding my teeth as my fingers rose to dig
          into my scalp.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Shit</i>, I mouthed before opening my eyes, turning towards Vitale
          again. "Milan...uh...no, no I uh...I don't know what—no, I'm—I'm back
          in Sicily."
        </p>
        <p>There was silence from his end.</p>
        <p><i>Fuck.</i> I could cry. I could fucking cry.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Of course," </i>He finally said, and nothing could have hidden the
          disappointment in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pacing, I chewed on my fingers, "But I can—I can fly out...I can come
          back."
        </p>
        <p>"<i>Do not bother," </i></p>
        <p>Everything in me sagged. "Elio, please—"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"I will be in Sicily next week for an event. We can talk then."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We can still talk now...I promise it's no inconvenience for me to
          come over and—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Do not do that. I don't want to see you now. I need a little space
            and time to think,"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh..." I stopped pacing, "Okay. That's...that's totally fine I—did
          you, did you hear everything? The," I swallowed, "The voicemail? I'm
          truly sorry, Elio. I swear on everything that I didn't mean—any of
          those things—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"The pictures you sent me. Do you know their origin?" </i>his voice
          remained leveled, even as he sidestepped everything I was trying to
          say like he didn't want to hear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No...it's still under investigation. My people, they're handling it."
        </p>
        <p><i>"Good." </i></p>
        <p>"But did you hear everything else I—"</p>
        <p><i>"I heard." </i></p>
        <p>I let out a sigh of relief, "Thank God, I—"</p>
        <p><i>"I am quite busy at the moment," </i></p>
        <p>"Oh..."</p>
        <p><i>"We will speak next week. Have a good day and take care,"</i></p>
        <p>"You t—"</p>
        <p>
          The line disconnected abruptly, and I blinked, bringing the phone from
          my ear and finding Vitale's eyes on me.
        </p>
        <p>"He said—"</p>
        <p>"I truly don't want to know,"</p>
        <p>"Vitale—"</p>
        <p>
          "I will be in my wing of the mansion; we have dinner with my mother
          tonight,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him for almost a minute before sighing defeatedly. "Okay,"
        </p>
        <p>
          With a nod, he was out of the room just as Aurora walked in, her
          curious gaze staring after Vitale. "Everything okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile was small but tight; I still hadn't—I couldn't comprehend all
          that had just happened. "Sure. Everything's...everything's fine."
        </p>
        <p>She smiled at me, "Breakfast will be ready soon,"</p>
        <p>"Thank you, Aurora, I'll be down,"</p>
        <p>She nodded, "You also have a visitor downstairs,"</p>
        <p>I frowned. "A visitor?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, one, Archibald Farraday?"</p>
        <p>
          My frown deepened, "Archi—" I stopped, my eyes widening. "Oh my God!"
          I yelled, "Upper?"
        </p>
        <p>"What do you mean by Up—"</p>
        <p>
          I was already dashing out of the room and past a confused Aurora.

        <p>Did you expect Elio to call?</p>
        <p>
          Zahra's black out, and dream, what do you think of that? Is there
          something else at play? Probably something related to the person who

        <p>What are your theories for this chapter?</p>

          Do you think Upper is the only visitor gracing us with his presence?

        <p>
          Don't forget to vote and comment as you read! I'd love to know your
          thoughts! I always go back to read comments before working on the next
          chapter. It's just like refueling my writing engine, so please don't
          leave the comment section starving, Zahra is already doing enough of
          that.
        </p>
        <p>Ha!</p>
        <p>Enjoy...the update.</p>
        <p>_______<br /><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p>
          <b>MY WORRIES </b>and confusion a minute ago slipped right away when I
          found Upper. His back was to me, and a black suitcase was by his foot
          as he gazed up at the red painting right above the open fireplace in
          the lobby room, his phone in his grip as he scanned the painting with
          whatever authenticator platform he was currently on, I watched him
          blow out a soft whistle when he brought the phone to his view,
          probably reading the information out on his screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No bloody way," he whispered, shaking his head. I couldn't help but
          smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hair was blonde now, and he didn't even have to turn around for me
          to know that the color suited him perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wore a varsity jacket and sweatpants, almost like he had just
          wanted to stop by his mate's house. He looked every bit of the student
          he was, and I couldn't help but feel a sting of guilt, knowing how bad
          I was about to shake a part of his innocence with all the things I had
          planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          A part of me knew I shouldn't have pulled them all back into this
          life, but a part of me also knew I couldn't do this without them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, clearing my throat audibly. He flinched, whirling around
          at the sound of my voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zah-ugh!" he shrieked in a half-shocked scream, his eyes wide, taking
          me in like he was staring at a ghost.
        </p>
        <p>My lips thinned, "I know,"</p>
        <p>He nodded slowly, "It's the—Your hair isn't—"</p>
        <p>
          "Yup, I know...I just woke up, should have—yup, ignore it." I managed
          a smile, a smirk, a grin; God, I didn't know; I just knew I was happy,
          and my face was doing things. "You look...you look great, Upper—I
          mean, Archie...you are—you look amazing, the blonde...the blonde is
          killing it, and the whole, frat boy and all look—it—it's great," I
          released a breath. "You look really great, and I'm so happy to see
          you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched how he relaxed, how a smile slipped onto his face, "We can
          hug, you know, you don't have to stand all the way there; it's making
          the whole thing gracefully awkward, and it is bloody uncomfor—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I was on him in the next second, racing and throwing my arms around
          his neck in a hug that seemed to knock the breath out of his lungs
          based on the sound that he gave.
        </p>
        <p>Hesitantly, his arms came around me, and he hugged me back.</p>
        <p>
          "God, I missed you so much," I said into his neck, "Thank you for
          listening, for coming here," I pulled back to look at him, though my
          vision was a little blurry. "You don't know how much it means to me
          that you're here."
        </p>
        <p>
          His smile was small, but it was there, and maybe it was a little sad.
          "I missed you too, Zahra...I thought for a long time that you
          were—were dead...when the call came, I had to leave; I had to make
          sure,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I sniffed, "I should have called sooner; I just didn't know what I'd
          expect..." I pulled back a little, brushing my hair to the side, "I'm
          sorry, Upper, for...for everything, all I did, the lies, the—the way
          it all crashed, the things I said, and revealed, I...I should have
          found a better way. I didn't think so far into the future, and I
          fucked it all up with everyone. Everything that happened is...is all
          my fault. There was a better way, but I never stopped long enough to
          consider it, and I'm so sorry I didn't."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a familiar gleam in his eyes before he pulled me back into
          him. I noticed how familiar and warm this hug seemed—it differed from
          the first one he gave me. "I was never angry at you, Zahra. I was more
          hurt than angry."
        </p>
        <p>"Still, I know my apology isn't enough to fix all I broke, but—"</p>
        <p>"Actually...I'd take your apology,"</p>
        <p>
          Something loosened in my chest as I recalled the day I told him the
          same thing after I'd learned about him and Devil.
        </p>
        <p>"Thank you," I whispered.</p>
        <p>He squeezed a little, "It's all right,"</p>
        <p>
          Pulling away and wiping my cheeks, "You, um—God, would have said I
          forgot my manners, but we both know I don't have any. Would you like a
          drink?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sure," he nodded, pocketing his phone as he looked around, "It's a
          nice house...mansion...place."
        </p>
        <p>
          My smile didn't reach my eyes; if he noticed, he said nothing about
          it, "Welcome to <i>Maniero de diavolo</i>, first of its kind."
        </p>
        <p>"Very...creative name,"</p>
        <p>"The person who built it was quite creative."</p>
        <p>
          I watched him look back at the red painting. "And that...it's the real
          one, isn't it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, glancing at the painting of a large red river over a
          medieval landscape and walking backward before turning towards the
          entryway to the wine bar. "Yup, the real thing," I said, hearing his
          footsteps behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bloody hell, that thing was painted with real blood and went missing
          like two decades ago after its successful first showing." He whistled
          again, "The red fucking river...right in plain sight; how did you get
          your hands on it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't," I responded as I entered the space. It was more of a wide
          lounge area, still carrying the dark-themed glare of the house, black
          marble tiles, thirty dark red booths and tables, crimson, dark green,
          and black wallpaper patterns, and a large display of expensive
          non-alcoholic wine collections with a black marble counter. "There's
          this uh...society, the people who own this estate, they nicked
          it...kind of. It was later given as a treaty gift from the head of the
          society at that time to Marti—to the person who built the mansion...it
          all happened a long time ago, non-recorded history stuff, I'll tell
          you all about it later—wait,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to face him just as I rounded the counter, "You're staying,
          right?"
        </p>
        <p>He nodded, "Yes."</p>
        <p>I sighed in relief, proceeding to get ice cubes for his drink.</p>
        <p>
          He walked up to the counter, settling on a stool. "I would have never
          found this place if you hadn't sent the encrypted location link." He
          eyed me, "It's not on the map."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, The estate is very...secret."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, "I need that. <i>Perfect</i> for hiding, at least for now,
          until we find the people you're looking for."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah,"</p>
        <p>
          On the call, I had told them that there was a very dangerous
          organization bringing harm to little children, though I didn't give
          them any further details...I hoped to let them all know how it related
          to me and what they were doing to the children...<i
            >what they did to me.</i
          >
          Shaking off the thought, I brought down a wine and a glass. "Hope you
          don't mind; it's non-alcoholic."
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned, looking behind me to the wall of different wine bottles.
          "All of them?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, all of them."</p>
        <p>"Odd...for you."</p>
        <p>"I know, right?" I chuckled, "Very odd,"</p>
        <p>
          I could still feel him eying me. I knew he was probably piecing
          together the coincidence of me not having alcoholic wine to all I told
          him on the phone about not wanting Vitale to perceive alcohol on my
          breath. Before he could ask, though, I spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So... what do you mean by perfect for hiding? Does that have anything
          to do with the royal people you want to assassinate?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, seeming exhausted. "Yes. That. I am being stalked by my
          family. I would have been here weeks ago, but I had to cover my tracks
          well,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," I dropped a few ice cubes into the wine glass before pouring a
          moderate amount of it and passing it to him.
        </p>
        <p>"Thanks,"</p>
        <p>"What do they want, if you don't mind me asking?"</p>
        <p>
          He drank more than a sip before shrugging, "I have no idea whatsoever.
          I don't even want to have an idea because if I do, I might cave...and
          go back, and I don't want to go back. Whatever they want, it must be
          quite important. They wouldn't go this feral just because they miss
          me...not when they sent me away in the first place."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "I see. Do you...do you need help warding them off?"</p>
        <p>
          He cocked a brow as if to ask what I could do, but then he looked
          around and tilted his head to the side, "Nope. They'll get the message
          soon enough and stop trying when they fail to reach me."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay, but if you <i>do</i> need help, I know a few people..."</p>
        <p>
          "I bet you do..." he trailed off with a nod, curiosity, and suspicion
          in his eyes. "What exactly do you do? This house, the men guarding
          this place? You'd think you were walking into some private high-intel
          army base. It was odd when they let me through, seeing how guarded the
          whole vicinity is."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, nodding. "They know a stranger wouldn't be here if they
          weren't supposed to be, and well, they know what you look like...I
          made sure to provide images, just in case,"
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, that explains it..."</p>
        <p>
          "And as for what I do...well...trade, multiple shares, several
          investments, real estate, underground business— mostly illegal. There
          is a little bit of contraband stuff here and there, a few legal
          dealings under untraceable aliases. It goes on, honestly."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me like I was some stranger in the body of a long-time
          friend. "How long? How long did you have all this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I stayed quiet for a few beats, working my jaw from left to right
          before responding. "Long."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So...so those days when we had nothing...when we went hungry and
          stole petty things to survive...you had all this?"
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed, "Yeah...pretty much."</p>
        <p>He shook his head, "Well, that's...that's kind of fucked up,"</p>
        <p>
          "I know..." I said, letting the silence drag on before I sighed and
          spoke softly. "I might have all this, but this isn't my home. I don't
          have a home." I drew mindless squares with the condensation from the
          ice cube box around the marble counter. "The money, the name and
          power, it isn't mine. I didn't build it all...I took it. Stole it. If
          you...if you subtract all of this from me, from the person you used to
          know. I'm nothing. I was nothing when I found STREET."
        </p>
        <p>
          I met his stare, "I was real with you guys. This house, this
          wealth...it's all just a dark, misguided illusion."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded as if he understood what I meant...and who knows? He
          probably did. I didn't know much about Upper's past, aside from the
          little he had divulged. I might have the most accessible means to get
          that information, but I had never run or done any background checks on
          any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only person I had pried into was Dog. I knew it would have never
          been easy to get him to speak to me, so I had to lure him in one way
          or the other. I already knew he had wanted to find his parents, so I
          thought using that means—though cruel—was the only way to get his
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, you might not be the owner of this place, but I can tell you do
          well with it. It's...it's nice."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you. Hopefully, I'll burn it to the ground soon," I said with a
          sharp smile, and he frowned.
        </p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>
          "You'll know. I want you to get settled in first, and then I'll
          explain every—"
        </p>
        <p>"Miss Faizan,'</p>
        <p>
          I raised my head to see one of the stay-in guards standing by the
          entrance of the wine bar. Upper had turned, too.
        </p>
        <p>"Any problem?"</p>
        <p>"No, Ma'am, you have...visitors."</p>
        <p>
          I frowned, "Visitors?" that was plural. And whoever they were, they
          had, one way or another, caused a little hiccup due to the look on the
          guard's face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, ma'am," he now wore an apologetic look as he spoke, "I'm sorry
          to discomfort you, but you might want to come...see what they...what
          is happening."
        </p>
        <p>
          I blinked and exchanged a look of confusion with Upper before we both
          started out of the wine bar, following the guard outside. I tied the
          thin material of the robe around my body as we reached outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment I caught what had distressed the guard, my footsteps came
          to a slow stop.
        </p>
        <p>Upper snorted.</p>
        <p>
          I blinked, watching the two tied men beside a car, trying to fight off
          the ropes that held them and the tape on their mouths that held back
          groans and huffs of discomfort. I couldn't recognize them, but I could
          recognize the person standing in front of them, a phone pressed to his
          ear, having a heated conversation with whoever was at the other end of
          the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You wanna bet he didn't know he had company until he reached here?"
          Upper said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm more shocked that he's here at all," I murmured, my happiness
          bubbling at the seams of everything I was made of.
        </p>
        <p>I went down the stairs, and Upper followed.</p>
        <p>Dog.</p>
        <p>
          He stood there, a tight frown on his face as he raked his fingers
          through his hair. "What the fuck am I supposed to do with them? How
          and why the fuck would you even tie up suspects...Jesus fuck, Tulip,
          I'm in Europe on holiday with two literal possible homicide suspects
          stuck with me!"
        </p>
        <p>Yikes.</p>
        <p>
          He hadn't noticed us approaching, "Oh...oh sure, Tulip, they are the
          perfect company, you fucking bitch. You did this on purpose, didn't
          you? My superior loses the case, yours triumphs, and your name is
          blasted in the front desk of big-time directors so you can make
          detective before me; I know how your silly little fucking, dirty,
          sex-muddled, <i>fucked</i> mind works,"
        </p>
        <p>I exchanged another look with Upper, who had a smile on his face.</p>
        <p>
          "You know what? Fuck you, Tulip, fuck you and your fucking husband, I
          hope he dies from diabetes. Fuck off." the moment he ended the call, I
          spoke up.
        </p>
        <p>"Why diabetes?"</p>
        <p>
          He snapped his head towards my direction, and his eyes hardened.
          "Well, you look like shit; I guess that's one great thing about my
          fucking day," he said before glancing towards Upper, "Sup."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper nodded almost awkwardly because Dog had averted his gaze from us
          almost immediately. He was rapidly texting someone on his phone now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around to see guards watching the scene with eyes that told
          me they were ready to gun down anyone who would make the wrong move.
        </p>
        <p>Looking back at the scene, I moved closer, "What's going on?"</p>
        <p>
          "Homicide suspects." Dog answered without looking at me. "A colleague
          of mine had used my car for a little cut and run. I had given her some
          cash to help ship my damn car here with a passing ferry because I had
          an early flight. I never checked the fucking trunk of the car because
          I didn't think she would forget people she had fucking—ugh," he sighed
          sharply, "Let's just say this is going to be bad for my portfolio."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What can stop the, uh...the bad portfolio? What's the easiest
          solution," Upper asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Making them disappear," Dog answered, watching the tied-up men fuss
          even more after hearing what he had said. "This is just blissfully
          fucked,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, "It doesn't have to be. I can...I can make it
          happen."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog threw me a glare, eyes as hard as they had been when I walked into
          the hospital room to see him a year ago...right after I had left him
          to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from the vacant look in his eyes when he stared at me,
          everything was more or less the same. He had filled out more, a clear
          observation showing he had worked on his physique the past few months.
          His job probably required it—All in all, my best friend stood before
          me, and I knew he wouldn't tell me it was okay to hug him. We still
          had a long way to go before we could ever get to that point in our
          relationship—<i>if</i>—we ever get there again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am very capable of attending to my problems, Faizan; I don't need
          your help," he said; the disdain in his voice was quite audible.
        </p>
        <p>"It's not about needing my help, Dog—"</p>
        <p>"It's Reagan to you, don't fucking call me Dog,"</p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, "Right...Reagan. It's not about needing my help. They
          can't leave here alive...as long as they weren't invited."
        </p>
        <p>
          He scoffed, "So what? You want me to stand by and watch you kill
          innocent people? That might be an everyday occurrence for you, Faizan,
          but I'm an officer of the law, and I won't stand by and watch you
          murder people—"
        </p>
        <p>"You said they were homicide suspects—"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, <i>suspects</i>, meaning, we are not sure if they <i>are</i> the
          ones we are looking for...and if they're here, and my colleague did
          this shit to fuck with me, that means they're not the bad guys, and my
          colleague probably nailed the real bad guys."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand your concerns, but it is the rule of the estate that—"
        </p>
        <p>
          I was cut off when a sleek red car drove into the compound, the guards
          following the movement with their eyes, not too alert because they
          knew it was one of my visitors...Milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          How in hell did they all arrive on the same day? No less than an hour
          interval, too?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Was this whole thing planned?" I whispered to Upper, and he shook his
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nope...haven't heard from Do—<i>Reagan</i> since last year when
          everything went down and—Penelope, well...we kept in touch, but we
          haven't spoken in months...it was a little strained."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded, wanting to ask him about Devil but refrained.</p>
        <p>
          The car stopped, and I could see her hesitation before she opened the
          door and stepped out.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked...she looked great; her hair was different, red...longer,
          and she had a new kind of brightness and innocence around her that had
          me dreading when I had to tell them about everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly and awkwardly grabbing her purse from the car, she locked the
          door and started walking towards us, eying the tied men on the ground.
          "Do I even want to know?" she asked tentatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched Dog eye her form from head to toe—it was quick, though,
          barely noticeable if you didn't know how often he stole glances at
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk, in turn, didn't look at him...not once; you'd almost think she
          was making it a point <i>not</i> to look at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, Pen," Upper said, and I watched her face soften as she moved to
          hug him.
        </p>
        <p>"Archie, it's so good to see you,"</p>
        <p>They pulled apart as he smiled, "Likewise,"</p>
        <p>
          Her gaze flickered to me, her warm smile dying immediately as I
          watched her take me in.
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed, "Hi, thank you...for...for coming."</p>
        <p>"Sure—"</p>
        <p>
          "As I was saying," Dog cut in, his gaze landing on me, indifferent and
          blanker than before, "Killing them is out of the option,"
        </p>
        <p>I tore my gaze from Milk. "It's a general rule, Reagan."</p>
        <p>
          "Well, it goes against everything I stand for now. They aren't guilty
          of any crimes, and this whole incident will be a lot to sweep under
          the fucking rug."
        </p>
        <p>
          "How was your colleague even able to ship them with the car in the
          first place? Don't they like...check or something?" Upper asked.
        </p>
        <p>Milk cleared her throat, "Who are they?"</p>
        <p>
          "Homicide suspects," We all answered simultaneously, and a very
          noticeable two-minute silence filled the air until Dog broke it by
          digging into his jacket pocket to pull out his badge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This badge holds certain privileges...for example, making sure people
          don't ask questions you don't want them to ask. My colleague happens
          to own one of them."
        </p>
        <p>Upper nodded. "Got it,"</p>
        <p>"You said you wanted them to disappear, and I—"</p>
        <p>
          "I said making them disappear would be more convenient. I didn't
          actually mean I was going to do it, though I wouldn't blame you for
          taking it seriously; you seem to be very skilled at getting rid of
          people who don't mean shit to you,"
        </p>
        <p>"I—"</p>
        <p>
          "As I said, I can handle my own problems; I don't need you or your
          goons making things more complicated than it has to—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Two loud shots from a gun rang out before he could let out his
          following words, and both men in question slumped over in death,
          bullet wounds on each of their heads respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold, calm quiet settled around us as we turned towards the house
          entrance just in time to see Vitale throwing his gun to one of the
          guards as he approached us, hair wet and sleeked back like he had just
          gotten out of the shower and had combed through with his fingers. His
          shirt was unbuttoned, giving me and everyone around us a peek of the
          tail ends of the large serpent tattoo around his sculpted torso.
        </p>
        <p>He had black slacks on, belted and buttoned.</p>
        <p>
          However, the look in his eyes was one ladened with annoyance,
          primarily directed at Dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he reached us, his arms came around my waist, pulling me to his
          body and kissing my lips softly, "Baby, why don't you go in, freshen
          up, and get ready for breakfast? I'll see to it that your...<i
            >acquaintances</i
          >
          are well settled,"
        </p>
        <p>"Baby?" I heard Milk whisper under her breath.</p>
        <p>
          I could feel all their eyes on us, and I had to do everything in my
          power to withhold the glare I so wanted to give the man holding my
          body to his.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forcing a smile, I tried to leave his hold, but his fingers dug into
          my waist, keeping me in place. "You didn't even let me introduce you,
          V."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No worries," bright blue-gray eyes bore into me. "I can do the
          introduction." He smiled, turning his attention to the several eyes on
          us. "I'm Vitale Conti, Zahra's fiancée and second master of Maniero de
          Diavolo; welcome to our humble abode," he said, bitterness lacing the
          tone of his voice. "I have heard a lot about the little...thieving
          group...oh, sincerest apologies, I mean...what it used to be, happy to
          finally see the faces behind the odd names...who's the Dog?"
        </p>
        <p>"Vitale—"</p>
        <p>"Go inside, come down for breakfast when you're well dressed,"</p>
        <p>
          Milk's eyes bulged, Dog's frown deepened, and Upper blinked in shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked around to see every guard watching the whole scene, both the
          ones in charge of reporting security detail to the society archives.
          Our façade was simple; there was a power hierarchy. I owned more than
          Vitale...but he was the Serpent head, ruled over the whole damn estate
          that wasn't on the map, and we had to make every single soul around us
          believe our relationship held the same hierarchy. I might have more
          than he did, but his word, command, and demand were final.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lead by example, and everyone was bound to follow. If they believed
          someone as strong as me bent to his will, it gave everyone good reason
          to bow to him during his probation period and after.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, he was using that to his advantage, and I was counting the hours
          until I stabbed a non-vital organ in his body. Instead of being
          rebellious, I forced on a smile. "Of course,"
        </p>
        <p>
          His grip released, and I gave one last glance to STREET. "I'll be
          right down...and um," I looked at Dog, "Don't worry about the guys. My
          people will clean any record on them; their deaths won't give you a
          problem."
        </p>
        <p>"Gee, thanks," he said dryly, eyeing Vitale and then me.</p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I caught the slight concern and curiosity on Milk's face
          before I turned and headed back for the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale's voice telling the guards to get rid of the bodies was the
          last thing I heard before I disappeared into the house, my emotions
          messier than they had been before I rushed down the stairs to meet
          Upper.

        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>
          It has been getting difficult and difficult to do Monday updates. I am
          trying to rectify this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, I'd love to plead with you guys. Your comments help a lot,
          and I would not lie and say the slight lack of comments and engagement
          on the last update made me feel a little lazy. A generator doesn't
          work with fuel or diesel, the body doesn't work without food or water,
          the updates doesn't flow without your beautiful thoughts and comments,
          so please, let's be energetic, and I promise to be as energetic to
          write new updates, and even surprise updates too! I miss those
          Wednesdays!
        </p>
        <p>
          A little appreciation to the handlers of Angelo and Gemma's accounts!
          They truly made my week with the amazing posts and captions! I love
          you guys so much! Here's a heart ❤️
        </p>
        <p>Okie dokie, let's fix things in this one! <br />Enjoy the update!</p>

        <p>
          <b>NUMEROUS FILES </b>and papers were scattered about on the table
          before me. I'd arrived at the compound early this morning after I
          dropped the call with Zahra. It didn't take long to reach my home
          there, heading straight for my father's study; I had unlocked the safe
          and retrieved all his private files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I delved into them, I'd taken a blank sheet of paper, sketching
          out the serpent tattoo I had seen on her chest. It was familiar. That
          particular one. I knew it was likely related to the Serpent society
          she was now mingling with. What had me questioning myself was the
          pattern in which it was drawn. It looked like a tattoo but blended
          inside her skin like a carving.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed as though she had endured too much pain to get that carving
          on her chest. A kind of pain that enhanced the sadness that had been
          in her eyes. Those engagement pictures had been nothing compared to
          seeing her physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head hadn't settled the day after seeing her; I had been too angry
          and hurt by her words to ask myself questions, to read entirely
          between the lines with how she looked, talked, and even gestured. Her
          body language gave a lot away, and it all came rushing back when I
          woke up after drinking myself to tiredness and ignoring her messages
          and calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flipped through the files on the desk, looking for the file stuck in
          a memory that felt very distinct. The Society was tight-knit and
          handled their business impressively. They were almost invisible if you
          didn't have eyes and ears in places one shouldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have never known of their existence if it hadn't been for my
          father's previous relations with them almost decades ago.
        </p>
        <p>Now I wanted to know everything.</p>
        <p>
          What business my father had conducted with them, why he had pictures
          of that particular tattoo, and why he had hurriedly taken them from my
          view when I'd reached his office on a very dark Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could still picture how his wrinkled and weak, fleshed hands shook
          on the papers and pictures when he shuffled them inside the file and
          shoved them into his safe, like having them on the table for me or
          anyone to see could burn the whole building down. Of course, I hadn't
          cared about it or the business he was trying desperately to hide from
          me then. I merely glanced and got to why I had come to see him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I admit. I used to be ignorant. And <i>sometimes</i>—as shameful as it
          sounds in our current situation—I was still mildly ignorant.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an innocence in being oblivious to things that could alter
          the bearing of any man. I already had too much to deal with, many
          people to look after, and an unsteady health balance to battle. My
          therapist would say to take things one at a time so as not to feel
          crowded, but my therapist was oblivious to a lot of things. He was
          oblivious to the fact that when it came to Zahra, I was willing to
          cloud my mind with damaging information as long as it worked for her
          benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I needed to find information on the things I was certain she
          would leave out of the conversation if we ever got to confront every
          issue we had. The things she had sworn secrecy to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the file I was hunting a few minutes later, slapping it beside
          the sketch I had drawn. I pushed all the other files furthest from me
          to give my vision a clear focus as I turned the file open and was met
          with pictures.
        </p>
        <p>Pictures of...</p>
        <p>
          Of children...several of them. Dead. Pale and white as a sheet, like
          all the blood had been drained right out of their body.
        </p>
        <p>And then...there was the carving of a serpent.</p>
        <p>
          One was on the anterior part of a little girl's elbow, curved around
          cutting scars—scars which seemed like it had harbored and endured
          numerous amounts of cuts. Another child bore the carving on her
          wrists, and as expected, there were several cuts on the child's wrist;
          another was the neck, another was the lap, and another was the base of
          the throat.
        </p>
        <p>It seemed like some sort of ritual.</p>
        <p>
          I dropped the pictures aside, checking the documents on the side. My
          father's signature had personally authorized these girls' transit to
          The Serpent Society. All their files were here. Date of birth, and an
          updated file with time of death. They were all between the ages of
          eight and twelve. Shipped from different European countries, direct
          locations unstated, and likely shifted since it was—according to the
          dates recorded—nine years since this negotiation went through. Maybe
          even later, seeing how clever my father was for covering tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          One couldn't investigate cases that happened in the future—and he was
          competent to date the whole thing years before it actually happened.
          There was no way for me to start tracking because I would never find
          anything related.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio? You in here?" the door was already pushing open before I could
          give a direct order for my brother to either stay out or come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now, soldiers at the compound were used to him. It wasn't
          surprising to have him walk into this building like he owned the
          space...he did.
        </p>
        <p>When he spotted me, he stepped in, shutting the door behind him.</p>
        <p>
          "You always complain about boundaries," I said, "Yet I find you
          crossing mine again and again,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring that, he strode towards me. "You've been avoiding me since
          you returned from Sicily."
        </p>
        <p>"You don't say," I said with a dry tone.</p>
        <p>
          "We need to talk." He pulled back the chair, "There's a lot you should
          know about—" he stopped his movement, gaze dropping and freezing on
          the images on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made no move to shield them from his gaze. I wasn't a coward like
          our father had been.
        </p>
        <p>Elia frowned, "Where the hell did you find those?"</p>
        <p>
          I watched him take a seat as he stared at the images with recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When my father was still alive, he made it a point to hide them from
          me. Am I to presume that you have seen that tattoo before? Did you
          perhaps meet with Zahra?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. "No. But I have seen the tattoo before," he said,
          looking away from the images to me.
        </p>
        <p>I frowned in question, but his eyes did not give anything away.</p>
        <p>He sighed, "I will explain."</p>
        <p>"You better—"</p>
        <p>
          "But first. Zahra called and texted. She said she was in Milan and
          wanted to speak to you urgently. I would have let you know, but you
          weren't available to speak to at that time—"
        </p>
        <p>"She left."</p>
        <p>
          He stopped, his shoulders falling as he nodded slowly. "That's..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "She shared her location with me, but I only found it in the early
          morning, and I was too intoxicated to go to her because I didn't trust
          myself not to go berserk, as you seldomly describe me—"
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't—"</p>
        <p>
          "I went this morning, as soon as I woke up, but she was already gone.
          Now I am here, trying to understand why and what this infernal tattoo
          means, and why it was on her chest around the bullet
          wound...<i>wound</i>..." I trailed off. "Like the scars on these
          little girls."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a ritual," Elia said. "I can't explain it, but it means
          sustenance. It's some fucked up occultic shit, a ritual to keep
          bringing a person back from the cusp of death."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at the images in front of me, sitting up. "These little girls
          were cut repeatedly...telling from how pale they are, they had been
          drained from their blood. The ritual was performed on them to keep
          them alive while they kept draining them," I said, my frown deepening
          as I slowly looked up at my brother. "The question burning my mind now
          is...<i>how</i> in <i>hell</i> did you get that information?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him forced down a swallow. "That is what I need to talk to
          you about."
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared at him for a long time before sitting up, tucking all the
          pictures into the file and closing it as my mind raced with thoughts,
          my chest tightening with worry, and then maybe a sprinkle of anger as
          I pushed all the papers to the side, making him my focus.
        </p>
        <p>"What is going on, Elia?"</p>
        <p>
          His jaw clenched. "There are a lot I didn't tell you before. "Mostly
          because you didn't ask—and I thought it was...convenient that you
          didn't because—because I wasn't sure I wanted to tell you, but first
          off," he squared his shoulders. "It wasn't just Casmiro,"
        </p>
        <p>"Elaborate,"</p>
        <p>
          "Moving Zahra. He didn't do it alone. I was involved as well, and I
          know that I was wrong, and I should have told you sooner—"
        </p>
        <p>"Do I look stupid to you, Elia?"</p>
        <p>
          He paused for a second before shaking his head and answering. "No,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good. I know of your involvement. I do not want to discuss that
          because it isn't high on my priority list as of this moment." I
          watched him steadily. "How, brother of mine, do you know about the
          Ritual?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He cleared his throat, "Like I said, you didn't ask me, and that was
          the only reason I didn't feel compelled enough to tell you."
        </p>
        <p>"Didn't ask you what?"</p>
        <p>
          "About me," he said, a tightness in his voice that told me this topic
          of conversation was something he had thought about before, something
          he held a slight grudge for. "Never once, since I came to live with
          you, have you asked me what I had been doing with my life before I met
          STREET. When I came back to Italy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept my face expressionless, "I never asked because I thought you
          would tell me on your own time,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned, "Or maybe you didn't care enough to ask. That's what I
          think,"
        </p>
        <p>"Oh,"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Elio, because if you really did care, you would have asked me
          how I coped, how I lived, and who put a fucking gun in my hands for
          the first time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied the anger dancing in his eyes before relaxing. "Well, if you
          must know, I cared, Elia. I care. There will never be a time in my
          life when I would stop caring." He worked his jaw, letting the silence
          stretch. I continued. "I knew that if I asked, you would have never
          told me,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe." He conceded, "But there would have been the knowledge that
          you asked."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay," I relaxed back on my chair. "You can carry on and be angry
          about that minuscule issue. But I also reserve my right to be angry
          that you left the safe place I found for you. You would have led a
          better and normal life if you hadn't returned. If you harbor blame for
          whatever conditions you might have endured, it is completely your
          fault, not mine."
        </p>
        <p>His frown deepened. "You can't be serious,"</p>
        <p>
          "I am. You might be here, and I enjoy your company most times when you
          aren't stabbing me in the back, but I still think you would have led a
          better life if you had never chosen to be rebellious."
        </p>
        <p>
          His glare would have ignited fire if that were possible, but I
          remained unmoved. Yes, I was still disappointed and furious at him for
          his involvement with Zahra's disappearance. It was why I had tried my
          best to ignore him. I wanted to see beyond the anger and talk to him
          without holding any contempt, but unfortunately, he sought me out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I straightened my hands, twirling my wristwatch a little before
          stapling my fingers on the table and pinning him with my eyes. "I
          didn't allow you to settle in here completely to rehash old issues,
          Elia. You know about that tattoo. How?"
        </p>
        <p>His jaw clenched. "I've seen it before. On a job."</p>
        <p>"A job..."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Years ago." we sat there, staring at each other, my thoughts
          running, his eyes searching to see if I had figured it out, but when
          he spoke his following words, I understood the hesitance in his stare.
          "Aside from Devil and Elia, I also go by E2."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. I kill people. Sometimes for money and sometimes for
          information."
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. That was how I got the information about the tattoo. There was
          this kid...she had it; she was dying, left in an abandoned car, legs
          wounded and dirty, lips chapped and pale. Her wrist was split open,
          dried blood from the cut. I knew there was no saving her, but I also
          knew the carving tattoo around the wound was somewhat responsible. I
          took a picture of it, and on my next job, I asked my client to pay me
          with information. What the tattoo meant. That's how I know."
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything he said registered in the corner of my mind. But only one
          piece of information was reluctant to settle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "E2..." I trailed off, unable to put a definition to my emotions. I
          was as angry as I was disappointed. I knew that name. I'd heard of his
          stealth in getting jobs done. He had been recommended to me a dozen
          times, but I had never indulged in the recommendations because I never
          go outside the family to handle inside affairs. And to think—
        </p>
        <p>"I know it's—"</p>
        <p>"Get up."</p>
        <p>I caught him stiffening. "What?"</p>
        <p>
          I was on my feet the next second, walking to the door behind me. A
          place I hadn't entered since my father passed. A room secluded inside
          his study, where he loved to teach me lessons when he didn't feel like
          taking us in a dive for the pool or tongue-lashing me with words that
          made me feel even more worthless than I was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opening the plain black wooden door, I ground my teeth together,
          looking back at Elia, who held a look of worry on his face, still
          seated.
        </p>
        <p>"Would you like me to repeat myself?"</p>
        <p>
          With a frown and hesitance, he got to his feet, walking towards where
          I stood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jacking him by the collar of his shirt, I pushed him into the room and
          closed the door behind us.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands, already used to the dark space, found the switch beside me
          as I flicked on the light, revealing the empty space, safe for the
          single surgical table in the middle of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even now, after years of never stepping in here, I could feel nerves
          and anger crawling up my spine. The fear was missing, but it didn't
          erase how it was so easy for my mind's vision to picture myself in
          this room. A victim. A son. A brother. Taking pains for things he
          could have been gently corrected for, things he didn't do, things he
          had hurt himself for, just so he could remember why he shouldn't do
          what he did to make his father angry enough to raise his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is..." Elia trailed off, seeing the whips hanging on the wall.
          Different sizes, depending on my father's anger and how badly he
          wanted it to hurt.
        </p>
        <p>I felt Elia's eyes on me. Confused and scared.</p>
        <p>
          "I spent almost all my life," I stopped, my voice echoing. "Almost all
          my life enduring pains in this room...just so my father would never
          think of transferring the pains he inflicted on me to the people I
          love. My sister, my little brother, you...and most times, when I can
          stop it, my mother."
        </p>
        <p>He remained quiet, listening to me.</p>
        <p>
          "I sacrificed my sanity, my innocence, everything that kept me from
          becoming <i>him</i>. I sacrificed it, protecting the ones I love," I
          looked at him now, just in time to see him swallow. "Protecting
          <i>you</i>," my stare hardened because, for the life of me, I couldn't
          comprehend it, couldn't understand where exactly I had gone wrong,
          trying to shield him from all the ugliness that came from the life we
          led. "I did all of that, endured all of that...and all for what? You
          being paid to kill people, Elia?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed him inch back a little. "I did what I had to do to fit in."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fit in where? In this deranged world? Can you listen to yourself?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Perfectly! I had nowhere to go, and I got mixed up with the wrong
          crowd. I did things that shifted everything I knew and believed in,
          but you know what? That was the only way I ever felt closer to you."
        </p>
        <p>"By killing people?"</p>
        <p>
          "It's what you did! You didn't think I was strong enough to be in your
          world, so I had to show you that I could fit in perfectly! I thought
          that was the only way you'd ever accept me. When I realized it
          wasn't—it was already too late. I was in too deep."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked away from me. "That was when I met STREET. It was the first
          time anyone ever truly saw me. The first time anyone ever made me feel
          like I could belong somewhere, that I was wanted. They took me out of
          that dark place. They <i>helped</i> me, but then, everybody left me.
          And I didn't—I didn't know how to—how to live with you; I didn't know
          how to cope, though I was trying, but I needed something familiar, so
          I went back to the job—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why didn't you just talk to me? Why didn't you tell me you were
          struggling?"
        </p>
        <p>"I couldn't."</p>
        <p>My chest tightened. "Why!"</p>
        <p>
          "You were dealing with a lot...with Zahra being in a coma, and—and
          then Gran Louisa falling ill. Your therapy, your health?" He
          swallowed, fussing with his knuckles, cracking and flexing, still
          unable to meet my eyes. "After what happened that year on your
          birthday, I didn't—I didn't want to say anything to burden you when
          you already had too much going on,"
        </p>
        <p>"Elia—"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't love doing it. Hurting people. I don't love it. It's just all
          I am without STREET. And it was impossible to jump back to the kind of
          relationship we used to have. You're not the same person you used to
          be before, and I'm not the same person either. I just—I felt a little
          lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't need to think back to know that while I had been present, I
          wasn't really there for him. We had conversations, but they weren't
          the ones we needed to be having. I had been neglecting and overlooking
          too many things in my own head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I walked to him and pulled him in for a hug. "I should have
          checked in," I said. "After the incident on my birthday. I should have
          checked in with you, and I'm sorry I didn't."
        </p>
        <p>I felt him nod but didn't respond.</p>
        <p>
          When I pulled back, I let my hand rest on his shoulder, making him
          meet my eyes. "Never hold back from me. I am your brother. I don't
          want to know if I carry a look that says don't talk to me; you come
          right to me if you have something to say; you don't think twice.
          You're my family. My only blood, and I will always, <i>always</i> have
          time for you. If we quarrel and have disagreements, it doesn't matter;
          you talk to me. If I ignore you, you better bulldoze your way into my
          space if you have something you want to say. You don't feel lost when
          you are with me. You don't need to be a killer to feel connected to
          me, you got it?"
        </p>
        <p>He nodded.</p>
        <p>"Answer."</p>
        <p>He swallowed and nodded. "I got it."</p>
        <p>
          "Good," I said, stepping away from him. "It's done. This job, you're
          done."
        </p>
        <p>He nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "I mean it, Elia. No more sneaking around. No more killing people.
          Unless necessary."
        </p>
        <p>
          "All right," he said with an assuring nod. "It's done. Unless
          necessary."
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes searched for deceit in his, but I found none. "Let's get out
          of here."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked surprised but relieved. "It's not...you're not going to—"
        </p>
        <p>I frowned. "Going to <i>what?</i>"</p>
        <p>
          "Nothing." He said, sweeping past me as though the ground he stood on
          was on fire. Still frowning, I made my way out of the room, locking
          the door behind me. "Listen, I uh..." He spoke, standing by the door
          to leave the study. "I have to leave...for Sicily."
        </p>
        <p>"You do?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah. Penelope informed me that the rest of STREET is already there
          with...with Zahra. I'm pretty sure this whole thing has to do with the
          MCSS, so I thought it would be good to go there and find out
          everything her people have planned, see if we can—I don't know, work
          together if possible?"
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." I nodded, and a small silence stretched.</p>
        <p>"But if you don't think it's necessary for me to go—"</p>
        <p>
          "You don't need my permission," I told him, pulling back my chair and
          settling on it. "It is your decision."
        </p>
        <p>He watched me for a bit before nodding, "All right."</p>
        <p>"How long will you be gone for?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know, but if I'm urgently needed here, I'll be by your side."
        </p>
        <p>I nodded. "Okay. Good."</p>
        <p>He opened the door, about to leave.</p>
        <p>"One thing before you leave," I called.</p>
        <p>"Sure, what's up?"</p>
        <p>"Find Casmiro; tell him to wait for me on the roof."</p>
        <p>
          Elia's brows furrowed into a frown. "It's a friendly conversation,
          right? What you intend to have with him...on the...roof?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared blankly for a long minute before speaking. "Ensure you send
          my regards to STREET, let them know I will be in Sicily in the coming
          week, and I'll be hosting dinner. They're all invited."
        </p>
        <p>"Sure."</p>
        <p>
          "Hm." I looked away from him, pulling the papers back in front of me.
          "Have a safe trip, and message me when you arrive." My gaze met his
          again. "I worry."
        </p>
        <p>
          "'Course," he said, nodding once and disappearing out of the study,
          closing the door after him.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          Casmiro stood close to the railing when I reached the rooftop. He
          looked well-dressed like he had just resumed work at the compound. A
          gentle wind was up here, familiar and tugging to the point that it
          softly resurfaced memories. I knew if there was any place we could
          talk, it would be here...I tend to make good decisions on this
          rooftop.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved closer to him, and upon hearing my footsteps, he turned and
          straightened a little, building up an armor, closing up a gate that
          would stand against the sting of every decision I had to make today.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew the decision I had to make, the decision my father would have
          made if he had been in my shoes. Fortunately, I wasn't my father, and
          fortunately for my best friend, I still liked him breathing, and
          though I might not be happy about how he handled things, I still
          appreciated the initiative. In a way, Zahra was alive because of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had also been willing to take the fall for Elia's involvement. He
          was always the selfless one. Throwing himself under the bus so there
          would be less heat directed at me from my father.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had always been that way when we were little; he knew my father's
          methods and what I got after every punishment. Though he couldn't stop
          many of these punishments, there were some punishments he had made
          hurt less.
        </p>
        <p>He cleared his throat, inclining his head down a little, "Boss—"</p>
        <p>
          "Cut the bullshit, Cas," I said, walking to stand beside him as I
          shoved both hands into my pockets, looking right ahead at the vast
          expanse of the compound, watching cars go in and come out.
        </p>
        <p>The man beside me went quiet.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't fill up the silence that had enveloped us. It went without
          saying that there was a lot for us to talk about. Things that went
          beyond him letting Zahra out of the compound without my permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          We both knew she had tried to kill him. We both knew I had let it go
          when I shouldn't have. We both know that action created a little
          bridge between our work and personal relationships. We both knew it
          needed to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard him exhale a breath before looking away from me and speaking.
          "I should have taken it seriously,"
        </p>
        <p>"What."</p>
        <p>
          A little hesitance from him, and then, "When you said you would fuck
          up our relationship and I'll hate you for it." he said, taking me back
          to that moment when he asked me to trust him, to let him in. "You said
          there would come a time when you would have to choose between me and
          something you want badly. I should have taken your word for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Staying still for a moment, I nodded slowly. "Yes. You should have."
        </p>
        <p>
          Windy silence stretched between us. From my periphery, I caught him
          shaking his head and looking down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can be out of the compound in a few hours." He said after a while,
          squaring his shoulders and looking at me. "I already packed my things
          and informed my family I might be moving—"
        </p>
        <p>"Might?" I asked, turning to face him.</p>
        <p>
          "I still need you to sign off on it. Unless you have decided to kill
          me." He stopped suddenly and frowned, glancing at the far ground below
          and then at me, "You didn't call me up here to push me down, did you?
          If that's what you had in mind, I'd like to request a bullet to the
          skull humbly, please."
        </p>
        <p>
          I scoffed with a smile, shaking my head and looking ahead again. "I'm
          glad you have your things packed."
        </p>
        <p>Hesitation, then, "Right,"</p>
        <p>
          "Hm," I said, not needing to see his expression before feeling his
          disappointment. "For someone who wants to leave so quickly, you sound
          disappointed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I just didn't think you would make the decision so quickly. If I
          didn't know better, I would have thought you were counting the hours
          until I left the compound."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am, indeed, counting the hours, Cas," I said, meeting his gaze. "In
          fact, I'm hoping to shorten the hours to minutes. I was about to leave
          the compound myself; we could drive together; I would be very willing
          to drop you off."
        </p>
        <p>"Wow, you must be very eager to get me out,"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, I am. I have been waiting for the opportunity to show you the
          building I'm currently living in, and also," my hand grabbed the
          single key card in my pocket. Pulling it out, I tossed it towards him,
          and he caught it easily. "You have your own condo in the building. I
          was going to show you at the opening party, but, for some reason,
          unbeknownst to me, you didn't show."
        </p>
        <p>
          He blinked at me, then at the white key card in his grip. "What does
          this mean?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It means you're not going to Capri. You're moving out of the compound
          to our building, not far from the compound. There is a place for you
          there. There has always been a place for you. Also, I should relay
          some essential information before you move: Angelo's condo is right
          across yours; although he hasn't moved in yet, he plans to in the near
          future."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What—" he shook his head, confused. "What about everything else?"
        </p>
        <p>"What thing else? Be kind to clarify, please?"</p>
        <p>His eyes narrowed, confused. "The—I betrayed you, E."</p>
        <p>
          "I betrayed you, too. I don't see you beating me up for it. I don't
          see you judging me and hating me enough to let Zahra die when you
          could have just ignored the cult man and let the efforts of the
          doctors bleed away with her life."
        </p>
        <p>
          He swallowed, looking away. "I did that because I was only—in a way, I
          was trying to make up for the shit I said about her dying when it
          first happened. Not that I cared about her or anything. I thought I
          had jinxed her recovery with my words when it all worsened."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm. Of course."</p>
        <p>"It's the truth."</p>
        <p>"I did not say otherwise, Cas."</p>
        <p>"You sounded otherwise...it's the way it sounded."</p>
        <p>"Of course."</p>
        <p>He glared, but it didn't hold any genuine malice.</p>
        <p>
          The silence that settled between us now was free of tension. There was
          not much to be said—an understanding simmered in us. There were no
          sorry and thank yous in our friendship. There was only a realization
          of where we had wronged each other and a silent promise to make better
          decisions next time—and yes, there would be a next time. It was
          inevitable in this kind of world we lived in, but I was optimistic
          that if we could go past this, we could go past anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Straightening, I pinned him with a serious look. "Now, come with me,
          before we start moving plans, there is a very weird cult group carving
          snakes into loved ones we have to look into."

        <p>
          <b>THE SHOWER </b>wasn't enough to wash away the nerves curling around
          my bones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nerves originated from the fact that I was about to speak to my
          friends. To reintroduce myself and allow them see sides to me they
          would have never guessed were there. I was about to put an awful shift
          to their reality, rip away a little bit of their innocence with the
          fucked-up hands woven around the dark crevice of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way or another, I had to get through today. They were my family,
          and although a lot of time had passed, I'd like to think I still knew
          them. They weren't insensitive; they would care about the children we
          needed to save. Their being here was proof of that—although I wasn't
          sure Devil would make it, not with the state I'd left Elio in and the
          trouble he had to go through, keeping the secret about moving me from
          the compound to Vitale's hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I closed my eyes, pushed my wet hair back, and raised my head
          as the water sprinkles from the shower sprayed my face.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flash of Elio's face before he turned away from me haunted the
          darkness behind my closed eyelids, and while I was trying to block out
          those thoughts from fully taking hold of my mind, my head took me back
          to my missing time, and the whole wariness looming around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I last remembered was accepting a drink from the staff at the
          restaurant and then waking up back here.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a possibility I had been drugged, seeing as accepting the
          drink was the last thing I remembered, but it didn't answer the
          question of why. What reason would the staff have to spike my drink? I
          didn't know him, can't even remember his name. I knew he didn't know
          me either, and he was a pretty average guy...except...from the moment
          he had disappeared and returned, he had been acting a little out of
          it. When he served me that drink, he looked almost scared, although he
          blamed it on his lack of sleep, which I understood pretty well, but
          could somebody have gotten to him? And if that were the case, who
          could it be?
        </p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes again, now frowning at the fogged-up shower glass in
          front of me, my eyes narrowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one but Vitale, Elio, and Devil knew my whereabouts...Vitale was in
          Sicily; Elio did not show up but called me today to check if I was
          still there. He also wouldn't do that to me—not when our first break
          up had originated from <i>me</i> drugging <i>him</i>—that leaves
          Devil, who, if I think about it, had no reason to drug me or show up.
          He hadn't responded to my text or calls, I could have been texting a
          blank wall for all I knew, and if he had wanted me out of Milan, he
          wouldn't go through the stress to drug me; he would show up and tell
          me to my face to fuck off.
        </p>
        <p>So, if it wasn't them...</p>
        <p>
          Could it be the person behind those pictures? The person who had taken
          those tarnishing pictures and had done nothing with them but send them
          to Vitale to cause problems with our relationship, using Elio.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was drugged and transported back to Sicily...I wasn't harmed or
          kidnapped; instead, I was brought back to my bedroom, and whoever they
          were had changed me into my nightwear; they had somehow slipped into
          the mansion without the knowledge of the heavily guarded compound and
          right into the privacy of my room without getting caught.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tilted my head, my brain working to crack this fucking uncomfortable
          puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had to be someone familiar with this place. Someone my people
          trusted. Someone close to me. Close to the society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale was the only one I knew would never be questioned if he were to
          arrive with me unconscious—no one else.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it couldn't be him...why would he lie? And if this person was
          connected to those pictures? Why would Vitale send me the photos,
          pretending he had just received them himself? Why would my stalker
          tell me I could have a stalker? And why on God fucking earth would
          Vitale stalk me?
        </p>
        <p>
          I trusted him with my life, as he did me. There was no way it could be
          him. Besides, just like the picture, this whole incident caused
          another argument between Vitale and me, simultaneously causing Elio's
          little faith in me to dwindle. Whoever this person was, they were
          hell-bent on entering my head and ruining my relationships...either
          that or it's...it's nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe the pictures were nothing, and perhaps I had ordered a drink
          afterward and got stupidly drunk to the point I couldn't remember when
          I had taken the flight back to Sicily...maybe Vitale had been right:
          drinking did cause a little bit of memory—
        </p>
        <p>My thoughts halted, ears perking up as I stood still.</p>
        <p>That was when I heard it.</p>
        <p>The slow thump of footsteps coming from my dressing room.</p>
        <p>
          Slowly, I lowered the force at which the shower worked so I could
          listen well.
        </p>
        <p><i>Thump. </i></p>
        <p><i>Thump. </i></p>
        <p>Stop.</p>
        <p>
          I stopped, too, freezing when I didn't hear anything except the light
          sprinkles of water—but I was sure I heard footsteps...and they were
          heavy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My bones tightened in alert as I turned off the shower completely,
          grabbing my bathrobe.
        </p>
        <p>"Vitale?" I called out, but there was no response.</p>
        <p>
          Slipping both hands into the sleeves of my bathrobe, I tied it around
          myself, stepping out of the shower. "Vitale?" I called again, and I
          heard nothing—heard nothing but saw the flash of a shadow underneath
          the door to the dressing room.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart jumped, and quickly, I dashed to the mirror cabinet, pulled
          it open, and grabbed the pocket knife I had kept in there. I flicked
          it open, the sharp edge jutting out as I angled the weapon into a
          tight forehand grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Vitale?" I called, my voice firmer this time, annoyance twisting at
          my insides as I advanced towards the dressing room door. Careful, even
          though I heard nothing from the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I curled my hand around the doorknob, setting my stance, ready for a
          fight. With apt precision and a made up mind, I pushed the door open,
          rushing inside the dressing room and stopping short when I found it
          empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my chest heaving, I whipped around. Several clothes and shoes
          dedicated to their shelves still lined the walls, all possible hiding
          spaces empty, and the door to my bedroom was shut close as it had
          been. Nothing was amiss, except...
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, my feet led me to the table in the middle of the room, where a
          short maroon-colored dress lay, coupled with pretty black suede heels
          and black crystal jewelry to match, all arranged on the table.
        </p>
        <p>On top of the dress was a white note.</p>
        <p>
          My heart dropped little by little with every step I took, my senses
          just now picking up the familiar and stomach-twisting cologne in the
          room. Swallowing, I stopped right in front of the table, falteringly
          dropping the pocket knife by the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before entering the shower, I had selected one of the two pieces I had
          sewn out of Milk's design; now, they were hung back perfectly to where
          I had taken them from.
        </p>
        <p>Confusion pulled at my insides as I picked up the white note.</p>
        <p>
          Scribbled on it, with a gut-tugging, very familiar handwriting, were
          the words:
          <b
            ><i
              >What have I taught you? You don't plan to invite your good
              friends into our world without wearing the colors that define it,
              do you? 
            </i></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands shook, and I dropped the card as if it burned me, stumbling a
          few steps back, staring wide-eyed at the table, the card, everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was frozen to the spot, clenching my fists to stop them from
          shaking; my hair dripped water everywhere, and my body grew weak as a
          dull headache began to form in my head.
        </p>
        <p>I pressed my eyelids tight.</p>
        <p><i>It's all in my head. This is all in my head. </i></p>
        <p>
          Snapping my eyes back open, my knees bulked, seeing the dress still on
          the table. The note. The heels. The pieces of jewelry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nausea gripped me immediately, my stomach twisting in a damning ache.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hell no," I muttered, rushing to my bag shelves, aiming for the sixth
          row up top, and grabbing the white bag sitting pretty by the left
          side. I flicked open the purse and, without thinking twice, grabbed
          the almost empty flask that I hadn't touched in weeks. Labeled on the
          stainless steel was a rough: <i>Xtra, Xtra emergencies.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming to terms with, in fact, an extra emergency, I opened it
          hurriedly, and with just four half-full gulps of the strong gin, it
          was empty. It burned my throat, cut off the nausea, and awakened me a
          little.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tossed the flask to the floor with a glare; my gaze lingered on the
          table for a while.
        </p>
        <p><i>This was a sick joke.</i></p>
        <p>A very fucking sick joke.</p>
        <p>
          Grounding my teeth, I walked to the table and proceeded to get
          dressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, I was heading down the stairs to the dining room,
          where I heard familiar voices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My phone was glued to my ear, and I was angrier than before. "What the
          hell do you mean you have no idea who I am?" I asked with my voice a
          little raised when I stopped halfway to the dining; I could swear
          conversations halted from that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"We recall no transaction or negotiation of that kind, ma'am—" </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "I paid for a singular overnight service just yesterday, and a staff
          of yours, whose name I can't remember, was with me throughout the
          night; he—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"We get a good number of clients at our restaurant, ma'am. Everyone
            comes and goes, and we never offer single overnight services. Are
            you sure you have the right restaurant, ma'am?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you—what the fuck does that mean? I was literally at—" I groaned,
          looking up and snapping my fingers at one of the men standing guard in
          a corner. He came rushing to me. To the person at the other end of the
          line, I spoke with the confusion and anger making my head spin,
          "Listen here, I don't know what kind of fucked up game your restaurant
          and staff played with me last night, but I swear to every fucking god
          I've ever prayed to, once I'm done with you and your establishment,
          you will run for the hills when you hear the words restaurant and
          ma'am."
        </p>
        <p>I ended the call, facing the guard. "Your rank?"</p>
        <p>"First base, Miss Faizan."</p>
        <p>
          "Perfect. Gather your best men; you're all taking a short trip to this
          restaurant," he brought out his phone on cue, and I caught his details
          popping up on my phone; sharing the location with him, I continued
          speaking. "Bring me their manager, and every fucking stuff you find
          there, don't forget to bring the ones who work the night shift too;
          someone has got to remember me; not all of them would have gotten
          dementia overnight."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The location is out of our jurisdiction to carry this out. Should we
          proceed?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus fuck, if I didn't want you to proceed, would I give you the
          order?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, Miss Faizan. All inquiry is for your protection. The area is
          right in the center of the Marino empire; if their people intercept
          us, we'd need clear orders on the next step to take."
        </p>
        <p>I squared my jaw, seeing the sense in all he had just said.</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck," I muttered, my heart thumping at the solution that crossed my
          mind. I gulped down before nodding. "Give me a second," I said to the
          man, bringing my phone to my view and navigating my call logs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without second-guessing my action, I clicked and placed a call through
          to Elio's contact number.
        </p>
        <p>
          His contact name was familiar and, at the same time, distant when it
          appeared on the full screen of my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Bigbaby</i>. With an outrageous amount of emojis from when I'd
          changed it from Dad, so no one would question the three consecutive
          eggplants before the many hearts and flower emojis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sneaked a glance at the guard before turning slightly and pressing
          the phone to my ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he didn't answer, I'd send my people anyway—they'd just have to be
          invisible—
        </p>
        <p><i>"I see the concept of space eludes you."</i></p>
        <p>
          His voice reached my ear, and my spine straightened. I had to force
          down a swallow to find my voice. Glad but, at the same time, surprised
          that he had answered.
        </p>
        <p>"Hi, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called, but I had to."</p>
        <p>A sigh and, <i>"¿Qué quieres, Zahra?" </i></p>
        <p><i>(what do you want, Zahra)</i></p>
        <p>
          I melted. Completely. My whole body softened, and my tense shoulders
          relaxed for him. I almost forgot why I was calling him in the first
          place. Almost.
        </p>
        <p>"Tu ayuda,"</p>
        <p><i>(Your help.) </i></p>
        <p>
          <i>"¿Qué pasó, estàs bien?" </i> The worry in his voice tugged at my
          heart, and I had to bite my bottom lip to stop the whine of longing
          from escaping.
        </p>
        <p><i>(What happened? Are you okay?)</i></p>
        <p>
          "Sí," I answered, "I'm okay," I reassured, going to the matter on the
          ground, knowing if I let myself dwell on his concern in his voice and
          presence at the other end of the line, I'd be lost before I could get
          all my words out. "I'm pursuing a lead on those pictures and need your
          authorization. I'm sending some of my guys to the restaurant I waited
          for you at, and I don't want their operation interrupted."
        </p>
        <p><i>"What does the restaurant have to do with the pictures?" </i></p>
        <p>
          "I think the person who took the pictures followed me all the way to
          Sicily. They're claiming they don't know me. I can't remember having
          left the restaurant in the first place, and I know I was there because
          I <i>was</i> there, but for some reason, there's someone hell-bent on
          making me and everyone around me believe I was never there, and it's
          fucking me up."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a little silence from his end before he spoke,
          <i>"Should I take care of this?" </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was stunned to silence for a minute, never expecting him to speak
          those words or even think to offer me anything...not after all I had
          done and said to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head. "No. No, it's fine; I'll handle it myself. I—there's
          so much we need to talk about, and I, I don't want this to—it's unfair
          to ask anything from you right now, not when we're not—when we're not
          in good terms and have so much we need to clear up and—do you
          understand what I'm trying to say, I don't know how to put it into the
          right words, I don't—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"It is unfair to ask anything from me? What do you call the subject
            matter of the reason for your call?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not going to make this easy. "I need your authorization to
          access an area in your territory."

          "They are different circumstances, Elio. I need your authorization;
          you are offering to help me solve everything without
          <i>needing</i> your authorization. But now I'm telling you, I can
          handle it myself; I just need your people to stand down while I get
          what I want; this is serious, Elio."

            >"Understanding the reason for your stubbornness will probably pull
            me a thousand steps back from the impressive recovery I've made

          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ, Elio—"</p>
        <p><i>"Let me handle it."</i></p>
        <p>
          "No." I said, my voice low, "For your sake, the sake of our
          relationship, and the—<i>hopefully</i>—positive effect from the space
          you need until we can talk and sort things out, I am
          <i>respectfully</i> declining your offer."
        </p>
        <p>I waited with bated breath as the silence stretched between us.</p>
        <p><i>"Okay. Your people won't be interrupted." </i></p>
        <p>I released a breath. "Thank you, and—"</p>
        <p><i>"Goodbye." </i></p>
        <p>
          The line disconnected, and I winced at the abrupt end of the call.
          However, unlike the call from this morning, the emptiness was missing.
          Instead of feeling down, I suppressed a small smile before turning to
          the guard. "Go ahead,"
        </p>
        <p>He nodded and swiftly went on his way.</p>
        <p>
          Squaring my shoulders, I walked to the dining room, where everyone was
          seated. There was an awkward quiet in the air as I turned my head to
          find Vitale standing by the side, his head downcast but rising upon my
          entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          They'd probably heard everything...me mentioning Elio's name a couple
          of times—even a bat flying by would know I was speaking to somebody
          named Elio—and with how soft my voice had gone, anybody without sight
          would see that whoever this Elio was, held a special place in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, considering everyone in this room was aware of who Elio was to
          me, they were also aware that I was engaged to the man standing by the
          side, watching me like he wanted to dip my head into a toilet and
          torture me until I swore never to make such phone calls when we were
          trying to pretend we were in love to my friends...my friends who were
          currently watching and waiting for a scene to unfold between my fiancé
          and me, because, for someone who was happily engaged to her fiancé, I
          was pretty fond of calling my ex and speaking to him like he was the
          center of my world. I could see the wheels turning in their heads
          right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk's eyes flickered from me to Vitale; Upper had a hand covering his
          mouth in embarrassment...for me. Dog, well...his frown was
          calculating, and if I knew him at all, I knew he already pieced
          everything together but was keeping silent to see the drama unfold
          because...why not?
        </p>
        <p>I cleared my throat.</p>
        <p>
          Vitale took me in from head to toe, his glare turning to a confused
          frown. "Lovely dress," he commented, waving away the real conversation
          topic he wanted to have—the topic my friends wanted to hear.
        </p>
        <p>"Of course, you selected it."</p>
        <p>His frown deepened. "I did?"</p>
        <p>
          My pointed look turned to a forced smile. "We need to talk about your
          new habit; I thought you trusted my dress sense?"
        </p>
        <p>"I have no idea what you're talking about."</p>
        <p>
          "No?" I crossed my arms, "You didn't just come to my dressing room?
          Leave me a note..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I've been here, entertaining your...<i>visitors</i> since you went to
          freshen up."
        </p>
        <p>
          My forced smile faded slowly when I saw the seriousness in his eyes. I
          turned towards the watching eyes. "He has?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yup," Upper answered. "Been here the whole time."</p>
        <p>"Then who was—"</p>
        <p>
          Vitale approached me, gloved hand pulling my arm so I could face him.
          When he asked, His voice was low for the two of us. "Why would you
          think I was in your room?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because I saw—I heard—" a chill ran up my spine. For some reason, I
          had mentally registered the whole dressing room incident as Vitale's
          doing, even though there were obvious signs that proved
          otherwise...but those signs brought in impossible conclusions. It
          couldn't be...
        </p>
        <p>It was impossible.</p>
        <p>"Zahra," Vitale pressed.</p>
        <p>"I don't know," I blinked, "I don't know what I heard."</p>
        <p>"You've been drinking."</p>
        <p>"It wasn't that—"</p>
        <p>
          "Are you kidding me, Zahra? I can smell the alcohol in your breath.
          Don't you ever listen to a word I say?" his voice raised a little.
        </p>
        <p>"No, not really."</p>
        <p>
          "First, you were missing time; now you're seeing and hearing things,
          yet you won't stop drinking—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, cut me a fucking slack, Vitale! I'm fine!" I yelled, shrugging my
          arm from his hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no, you're not fine because you're about to go kidnap innocent
          people from a restaurant out of our fucking jurisdiction!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Which I got authorization for, Vitale! If you want to eavesdrop on my
          fucking private conversation, do it well!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not eavesdropping if you're speaking for the whole goddamn
          mansion to hear."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, fuck off!"</p>
        <p>
          "You fuck off because you're slowly losing your damn mind, and you're
          the only one who can't fucking see it!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sorry to interrupt," Dog spoke up, "But I was wondering when we can
          get to the hate-kiss, hate-fuck, part—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale sent him a glare that had him raising his hands in surrender,
          "I meant no harm, Mr. Cunt. I just needed to ask so I could be
          prepared, you know."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the third fucking time, It's Conti," Vitale said with a grit.
        </p>
        <p>"Sure cunt," Dog responded with a blank stare.</p>
        <p>
          A groan erupted from Vitale's throat as he looked at me again. "You're
          the only reason he's alive; I hope you know that."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed. "The jig is up. I'm not pretending to them that this thing
          between us is real,"
        </p>
        <p>"You fucked it up when you called <i>him</i>," he responded.</p>
        <p>"I had to,"</p>
        <p>"You didn't—"</p>
        <p>
          "I had to, V. You'll have to trust me on this. I've never lost my
          mind; someone brought me back here, and it could be the person who
          also took those pictures. You're right, I have a stalker, and whoever
          they are, they're close."
        </p>
        <p>"Damn, the drama." Dog said.</p>
        <p>"Knock it off," Upper chided.</p>
        <p>
          I didn't take my eyes off Vitale. "You've trusted me all these years;
          have I ever let you down?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, would you look at that? She has selected people she doesn't let
          down. That's news." Dog, again.
        </p>
        <p>Vitale transferred his glare to him. "This doesn't concern you."</p>
        <p>"You're literally having the conversation in front of me—"</p>
        <p>
          "Would you just shut it?" That came from Milk, who was now frowning at
          Dog, who, surprisingly, kept quiet with a grunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale looked at me. "We'll talk about this later, at length. For now,
          let's get to the reason they're here." He said.
        </p>
        <p>"Finally," Dog muttered.</p>
        <p>Vitale resumed his position by the side.</p>
        <p>I turned, facing the familiar faces. "I'm sorry about all that."</p>
        <p>
          "It's all right," Upper said, and I averted my gaze towards Milk, who
          quickly removed hers from mine.
        </p>
        <p>This is going great.</p>
        <p>
          I dragged in a breath and let it out. "First off, I just want to thank
          you guys for showing up despite everything. I know you probably have
          so many questions about all this, and I promise to answer them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Amazing. Go straight to the point. What's this thing you said about
          some organization causing harm to kids?" Dog asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "Yes, right. The whole...<i>thing</i>...is bigger than how I
          phrased it on the phone. A conversation like that wasn't what we could
          discuss miles away from each other."
        </p>
        <p>
          "How big are we talking?" Upper asked just as a guard arrived with
          binding files, handed them to Vitale, and walked away. Vitale was kind
          enough to pass each file to the questioning eyes around the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Big. Big and expanding, becoming a global menace in the underground
          world. Encompassing Europe to other continents gradually," Vitale
          informed, standing straighter as we watched them open the file,
          looking through.
        </p>
        <p>Milk's shocked frown drew my attention. "Children trafficking?"</p>
        <p>
          "Bloody hell, when you said causing harm to children, I wouldn't have
          thought—Breeding?" Upper trailed off.
        </p>
        <p>Dog was quiet as his eyes took in the content of the file.</p>
        <p>
          "The MCSS..." Milk spoke again, looking up at me this time. "It
          says...<i>Marino</i>caporegime sovereign society?"
        </p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>"Wait...the Marino we know? As in, Elio?" She asked to clarify.</p>
        <p>I nodded again, "The very one."</p>
        <p>
          Her frown deepened as she dropped the file on the table. "That's
          impossible. He would never be involved in something like this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "He isn't," I clarified. "His signature, though...isn't very
          innocent."
        </p>
        <p>Upper whistled.</p>
        <p>
          "Those records are just the background scope of what they do," Vitale
          started, "Child trafficking and reproduction... for all the wrong
          purposes," His eyes trailed to me before focusing on STREET. "They use
          these children for several sexual activities. All children are born
          based on specific orders from clients."
        </p>
        <p>"The fuck..." Dog's voice was twinged with disgust.</p>
        <p>
          My heart pounded twice as hard at its original pace as I took over the
          explanation. "Like, say some sick fucker has a fetish they want to
          sate with a half Asian, half African child, or half American, Asian.
          We have people on ground ready to deliver sperms and eggs, and a
          waiting womb ready to carry. I'm talking thousands and thousands of
          people," I said. "These children are taken care of until they're five
          years old. When they reach that age, they're trafficked to the state
          of preference or order. Deposited in different houses, each one
          getting handlers, you can think of it as foster homes, but with adult
          visitors daily who like to get their cocks sucked."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh my God," Milk said, the horror in her eyes draining whatever blood
          had been on her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If this is breezed by under the noses of authorities," Dog pondered
          aloud. "it's gotta be funded by powerful governmental bodies from
          different continents...states..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And worse..." Vitale injected "made men, secret societies, criminal
          rings with several underground businesses tied to their names."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, "The larger scope of this organization doesn't exactly
          center on pedophilia. It's sex trafficking. When these kids turn 14,
          they're taken out of those houses, boys, girls, distributed to
          different criminal families, whore houses funded by the men at the
          top. These kids, at a very young age, are introduced to prostitution
          and drug testing; they're made airheads, addicts, and—" My throat
          clogged, and Vitale's eyes met mine, a small understanding silence
          passing between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And there's no one doing anything to stop it," he continued for me.
          "Zahra and I had a long-standing plan; there was enough information on
          one of those flash drives to put these fuckers in their place. But we
          underestimated the whole thing; it turned out to be bigger than what
          we bargained for...our years of hard work bleed into nothing because
          we needed to re-strategize."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This plan he speaks of," I took over, "Is why I came to Milan, in
          search of those drives. We knew little about its whereabouts and
          needed to be as quiet about our search as possible. I found a way to
          blend in with—the creation of STREET and lying in wait for years,
          knowing how important those drives were and the number of people who
          would want to get their hands on it, peradventure they find out about
          them. We knew if it fell into the wrong hands, we'd lose everything,
          and this whole thing would continue,"
        </p>
        <p>There was a silence that I welcomed and let settle.</p>
        <p>
          When I found the courage to speak again, I blew out a breath. "My
          actions during our last mission were carried out with blinding
          emotions and promises of the bigger picture. I didn't say those things
          in that hospital room because I was a narcissistic bitch on a
          self-sabotaging rampage. I knew what was coming, and I thought it was
          best to have you guys out of it because I didn't bargain for how big
          the whole thing was going to be. I knew you all had your own thing you
          wanted to get done, and I couldn't drag you guys into my mess,"
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't your mess," Vitale said, voice hard.</p>
        <p>
          "It was. I don't think anyone wants to discover they are in love with
          the very person they'd spent all their lives hating right after they'd
          left their friends to a fucking sinking ground, all for nothing. I was
          a complete wreck that day, but I knew I had to get you guys out of
          that life. Though, I admit and take all the fault for handling it as I
          did. I can't blame my emotions for everything I said," I looked
          towards Dog, "And everything I did, but I know getting you guys out
          had been the only good decision I made that day. It was worth it to
          see how far you all have come and the people you became on your own."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was another long quiet before Dog dropped the file on the table,
          not meeting my eyes as he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How did you find out about the organization? You said you and your
          mock fiancé have been at this for years; you both seemed to be well
          informed, even without details provided by the flash drives."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart skipped a beat with a hard thump that had me swallowing and
          looking at Vitale, whose eyes were already on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He offered me a small encouraging nod before I turned to the group
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Letting out a breath, I braced myself before letting the words that
          had suddenly gone dry and tight out of my throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was one of them," I said, pressing on the burn in my chest as a
          deafening quiet settled around the room. Dog's head whipped in my
          direction, the shock in his eyes mirroring the same look in Upper's
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-what?" Milk's voice was merely a whisper, her whole body going
          still.
        </p>
        <p>
          My voice was chapped and thick as I spoke, "I'm well informed about
          this organization because I was in it..." I swallowed, "I was one of
          the kids we are trying to help."

        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>
          If you're on the discord server, you would have been aware of the
          update coming today instead of Friday. I got the flu, and I'm under
          medications, hence why I was unable to update at the scheduled period.
          I shouldn't even be here, but I promised, and I love keeping to
          promises so...here you are!
        </p>

          cough and restore dead voices due to cold. Don't forget to vote as
          well.

        <p>Enjoy the update beautiful people,</p>

        <p>
          <b>THE SILENCE </b>that stretched around the dining room was cold and
          quiet as my words settled.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, I wondered why I felt the silence so strongly, why I
          felt the cold brush of its chilly hand graze down my spine, sending an
          odd calm into me, muting the noise in my head, pulling away the heavy
          bricks on my shoulders and chest. The fear of letting this part of me
          out in the open was now free of its hold on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I let out a silent breath, gathering the courage to take in my
          friend's expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked towards Dog in time to see resignation settle on his face as
          he fell back on the chair. Upper had a sad frown on his face, his grip
          on the file releasing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk held the remorse she felt so firmly in her expression, and I
          didn't miss the way tears brimmed in her eyes as she got off the
          dining chair, making her way toward me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart was pounding, my stomach curling with anticipation when she
          reached me and, without question or verbal exchange, pulled me in for
          a hug.
        </p>
        <p>
          I held my breath, unable to relax; my bones felt stiff, my mind empty,
          wondering what her hug meant, hoping it wasn't pity, hoping she didn't
          think I revealed all that because I wanted her forgiveness without
          having to let her know how sorry I was for all the things I said to
          her that day because it wasn't—
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry," she whispered, halting my thoughts. "I'm so sorry you had
          to tell us about you this way. This should have been on your terms,
          not ours."
        </p>
        <p>
          Softly, slowly, I felt myself relax in her arms; not until this moment
          did I realize how much I missed her and the friendship we used to
          share. I didn't deserve this, not one bit. "Thank you," my voice
          croaked out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gently pulling away, she blinked back the tears in her eyes before
          they could fall. I smiled at her, and she returned it with a small,
          stiff smile, glancing towards Vitale and then me. "Do we have a plan?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We better have a plan," Dog injected immediately, this time, with a
          glare at no one in particular as he sat up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppressed a smile, knowing that though things might not be smooth
          and sailing between us, some silent understanding lingered around our
          midst, and while Dog might not say it out loud, I could see the
          concern in his eyes and the anger he now held on my behalf. "These
          people shouldn't exist."
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper nodded, "You're right, they shouldn't, and if the information on
          this file is as accurate as it shows, taking them down will
          take...time, and by time, I'm not talking months; I'm talking years."
        </p>
        <p>"Not unless we have an inside man," Vitale said.</p>
        <p>"Cut the head; the tail becomes useless," I joined.</p>
        <p>
          "Cut the..." Milk trailed off, her eyes growing large, "Marino is
          basically the head,"
        </p>
        <p>Vitale and I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          This brought a frown to Upper's face, and Dog raised a brow in
          question. "You don't plan to kill him, do you? Because you gotta know
          that's impossible unless you wanna go all <i>Eve</i> on him,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, "No. Before it all went down with the gold, Elio had
          been very willing to fight the fight with me. Hopefully, he's still as
          willing. Devil was the chain we intended to use since he's a Marino
          and should have enough say in the matter."
        </p>
        <p>"But apparently, he's a no-show," Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "Actually," Upper spoke up, clearing his throat, "He should be on his
          way,"
        </p>
        <p>We all turned to look at him as silence filled the room.</p>
        <p>
          "What," Upper stated, eyes darting around us as if he couldn't guess
          why we were all looking at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you mean what?" Dog asked, "How do you know what you know."
        </p>
        <p>"I just do,"</p>
        <p>"Are you tracking him?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>"With his consent, yes."</p>
        <p>"The fuck does that mean?" Dog asked, seeming even more confused.</p>
        <p>
          "That is an information I would not like to divulge. Now, back to more
          important matters—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Have you guys been talking?" Milk asked, turning fully to face him,
          "Have you been talking to Devil while leaving me on seen for four
          freaking months?"
        </p>
        <p>"He left you on seen?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "What? No—I mean, yes..." Upper panicked, "But I've not been talking—I
          didn't leave you on seen, I just—it was—I had school and—and homework
          and family shit and—and stuff that, I didn't talk to no—ugh, no
          comment."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Should have just gone with no comment before the whole ramble," Dog
          advised.
        </p>
        <p>"You try being in the spotlight for a change,"</p>
        <p>"I'm always in the spotlight,"</p>
        <p>"Oh yeah?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah, just last week, I was—"</p>
        <p>
          "What exactly are we talking about now, and how relevant is it to the
          children we must save?" Vitale cut in, and silence fell upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cleared my throat, "Okay, we can adjourn this until Devil arrives so
          he can be included in all we talk about. For all we know, Elio might
          have something planned. I'm hoping to discuss more with him when we
          meet once he arrives in Sicily,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's a start," Dog said, "It would also be wise to get a whisper to
          the authorities as well. Get in a little case opened without the
          knowledge of people who shouldn't be involved,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "How's that going to be possible?" The question came from Milk, and I
          caught Dog stiffen, gaze darting at her momentarily before he
          responded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is if you know the right people. To take down something this
          large, we would undoubtedly need a bit of flexibility here and there,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's right," Vitale said. "Pulling down the MCSS wouldn't be quiet."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Won't this also hurt, Elio? Say we manage to pull it off, his name is
          all over the place, and the authorities are going to take it into
          account," Upper pointed out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frowned, "That's something we'll have to look into, but I won't deny
          it, Reagan is right. Something that big won't go unnoticed; laying a
          foundation somewhere is better. If someone doesn't take the fall,
          someone has to take the credit. This could also speed up Reagan's push
          for making detective—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not like I need the push," He added quickly, gaze falling on me. "I
          don't care about whose name gets on the paper; I care about stopping
          more innocent children being roped into the bullshit." 
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah," I answered with a swallow as he looked away.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll have our people share the contents we found on the flash drive.
          It must be studied to understand what we are dealing with here."
          Vitale stated. "To proceed with this, I must ensure we're all on the
          same page. Now's the time to leave if you don't want to get involved
          because once you're involved, you must be willing to do and sacrifice
          whatever it takes to see this mission through." He punctured his words
          into the air, giving them all a choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were silent before Upper closed the file in front of him and
          shrugged, "I don't know about anyone else, but I never back down from
          a challenge, especially when it involves helping people who can't help
          themselves. I'm in for the long run."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too," Milk announced, "Not going anywhere until we make this
          change and save the world—"
        </p>
        <p>"It's not that deep," Dog muttered.</p>
        <p>
          "Didn't ask for your opinion, but if you must know, a great man once
          said, children <i>are</i> the world," Milk responded with a firm
          glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sure, Michael Jackson was great," Dog said in a bored tone, sitting
          up, "I'd rather be here solving a real case than in Washington trying
          to decipher why some psycho husband killed his psycho wife,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That is settled then," Vitale nodded, "I'll work on having the
          contents shared with you guys, and we will double back in two days.
          That should be enough time to get acquainted with your surroundings,
          as I assume you are all staying. Till then," Vitale turned to me, "I
          have work to take care of," he came close enough to me, placing a soft
          kiss on my hair and saying softly, "Don't forget dinner tonight,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Actually," I started with an apologetic stare, "Can I skip? I'm
          not...I'm not feeling up to it, but I will...tomorrow—when I'm
          more...sober."
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes searched mine, and he hesitated a few seconds. "Okay, I'll
          call my mom and let her know. We'll talk later."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah,"</p>
        <p>He walked away, leaving me and STREET alone.</p>
        <p>"Now I'm confused," Upper said. "Are you guys real or...fake?"</p>
        <p>I smiled, "We're good friends,"</p>
        <p>Dog snorted, "He wants to fuck you."</p>
        <p>"He doesn't—"</p>
        <p>
          "Or he's in love, one of both. Not that I care or anything," Dog said,
          getting to his feet, "I have work to do, thanks to your mock fiancé
          who thinks shooting people automatically erases them from the face of
          the earth,"
        </p>
        <p>"We can—"</p>
        <p>
          "Still don't need your help." He said, pinning me with a stare and
          lowering his voice, "We'll talk about the other stuff later."
        </p>
        <p>The other stuff being the information I had about Tora Vuković.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded and gestured to a guard to come over. "Show them to their
          respective rooms," I said, looking back at them, "You've all come a
          long way; we should meet back here and discuss over brunch. I'll ask
          Aurora to make something else since breakfast is basically done."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cool," Upper said, "Would you be up for a tour of the mansion later?
          There's a lot to see here,"
        </p>
        <p>"Of course," I beamed, turning to Milk, "Do you want to join?"</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes shifted between me and Upper, and I knew her answer before it
          came. "No, uh...not today; I have work to handle and things to oversee
          and rearrange. I didn't think I would be here long, but you guys have
          fun...touring," she said, walking away with a guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't bother asking Dog because he was already leaving with one of
          the guards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dragged in a breath, and Upper offered me a wide, close-lipped
          smile. "They'll come around; I'm sure they understand,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded. "I still need to talk to them, one on one, but I guess they
          need the rest, time to process everything they've just learned,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," he said, "But hey, um—I just wanted to say I'm sorry. What you
          had to go through and—"
        </p>
        <p>"It's okay, it was a long time ago,"</p>
        <p>
          "Still, I want to—more than ever—stop these guys from this shit
          they're doing, it's diabolical. No one deserves to be a victim of the
          whole bloody system,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We'll do all we can to stop them." I smiled, "I'm more confident now
          that I know you guys are on board."
        </p>
        <p>He returned the smile with a firm reassuring nod.</p>
        <p>
          "Wanna take that tour now? I'm not doing anything at the moment; I
          might as well show you around,"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes—"</p>
        <p>
          "And maybe I can pull out some things I'm eager to know...like you and
          Devil? What's happening there?"
        </p>
        <p>"No comment,"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, come on," I put my arm around his, pulling him with me, "you
          saying no comment makes me want to bug you more. Come to think of it;
          you only mentioned your communication status with just Reagan and
          Penelope, not Elia..."
        </p>
        <p>"No comment, still. There's never going to be a comment on it,"</p>
        <p>
          I chuckled, "Well, good thing the mansion is quite huge; I have a lot
          of time to frustrate the 'comment' out of you,"
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          The whole day went as planned; I took Upper on a mansion tour before
          he retired to his room to freshen up while Aurora made brunch for
          everyone. Dog requested to have his in his room, Milk came down with
          Upper, and I watched from a corner in the second floor how they
          conversed easily, knowing the whole atmosphere would change if I
          interrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had asked Aurora to bring the food to my room, but I could not eat.
          I only had two to three spoons of the food and then discarded the rest
          in the toilet, knowing Aurora would be ready to report my
          returned—still filled—plate of food to Vitale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the rest of the afternoon interrogating the people who had
          been taken from the Milan restaurant; of course, they knew nothing.
          Vitale hadn't been happy with the idea of having outsiders in here, so
          he had gotten them back, seeing as they weren't of any use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disappointed, I managed a conversation with my assistant for the rest
          of the afternoon, catching him up on everything he had missed due to
          his absence while caring for his newborn and wife.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to his insistence, he would be returning to work by the following
          week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to take a little break myself until he returned. I needed
          some time to speak to Reagan and Pen, to apologize for all the shit I
          pulled personally—I couldn't do it today, though; I wasn't sound
          enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the tour with Upper and the failed brunch, I began to feel sick.
          The familiar sickness that took hold of me whenever I refused my body
          the substance it wanted.
        </p>
        <p>I just had to wait it out.</p>
        <p>
          The afternoon turned into night, and I found myself pacing in my room,
          refusing to eat dinner because I lacked the appetite. Aurora had said
          all my friends were already at the table, and I wondered what they
          thought of my refusal to join them. It probably wasn't helping my case
          to get on their good side. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was a mess; I'd rather them think the worst of me than see me
          like this. I didn't know which would be more embarrassing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had showered three times and been in the bathtub for almost an hour,
          fighting off the urge to appease the need for alcohol. I should have
          never taken the little I did today—but what was I supposed to do? I
          needed to clean the edges of my mind before I could face STREET or
          forget that someone had been in my dressing room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at the bedside clock; it was almost eleven pm, and I still
          paced in my nightwear, a glass of non-alcoholic wine in my grip,
          trying to drink myself to slumber, but my eyes were as open as a
          bat's.
        </p>
        <p>It didn't take long before the sweating started.</p>
        <p>
          I dropped the wine glass on the nightstand, darted into the bathroom,
          and took off my clothes to escape into the shower.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood under the cold spray...long enough to catch a cold, long
          enough for my legs to feel the strain of standing for so long, and
          when I couldn't stand the strain on my legs anymore, I turned off the
          shower and wore my robe, shivering slightly as I got out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, my stomach didn't ache this time; I only had a slight
          headache, sweating, and shaking hands. Even if I were to throw up
          anything, it would be the wine I had taken and the little food I had
          managed to get into my stomach, and honestly, I didn't want to let
          those go, knowing I would be weak as hell with nothing in my stomach.
        </p>
        <p>I hated this. I felt pathetic.</p>
        <p>
          Drying myself up and getting dressed into my nightwear, I was in my
          room again, my hair still slightly wet, but I didn't mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got under the covers, checking the bedside clock to see it was
          almost midnight.
        </p>
        <p>My eyes were still open; I was still craving—cold, but craving.</p>
        <p>
          I folded into myself, closed my eyes, and stayed there for the longest
          time in the quietness of my room, with the knowledge that someone had
          been here; they had probably walked these four corners, touched my
          things...touched <i>me</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hands rolled into fists on the sheet, eyes tightening close as I
          tried to block out those thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone had drugged me, brought me here. Changed me, saw me naked,
          covered me...all without my consent. They had been in my dressing room
          while I was in the bathroom; I'd been so vulnerable, yet they didn't
          do anything but peruse my wardrobe and drop me a little note.
        </p>
        <p>
          A note that harbored the handwriting belonging to a man who was
          supposed to be dead. A note left in the dressing room that had carried
          the musky smell of a cologne I had spent so many nights washing off my
          skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd kept the note to show Vitale later; only he would recognize
          Martino's handwriting as I did. His admittance that I wasn't being
          delusional would clear all my doubts and help me make sense of this
          odd situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was driving me crazy. I knew I was careless, but not
          <i>this</i> wild. I was off with myself; I missed things; I lived in
          this dreadful mansion that held so many nightmares, sleeping in this
          room where the dead bastard had taken me in the pretense of being
          willing to give my body because we were in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now...now <i>this</i>, a weakness that came from the inside,
          plaguing me even when I had my friends in the same vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Swallowing, I opened my eyes, watching the dark room highlighted by
          sainted candles at the corners, supplying the space with a warm glow
          that had been provided to help me sleep better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glancing at the bedside clock, I sighed, seeing it was already twenty
          minutes past one in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stretched my body across the bed, reaching for my phone by the
          bedside table and settling back again. I scrolled through apps; maybe
          I could try watching a movie...or rewatching something I've seen
          before...the background noise might help lull me to sleep. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When Martino first brought me here, I was obsessed with watching TV
          shows. They taught me a lot and helped supply the perfect escape. When
          I met STREET, I made sure they saw most of my favorite shows, and I'd
          even roped Elio into binging one of my favorite shows, too. I wasn't
          sure anyone noticed that I'd seen almost all the shows I made them
          see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of heading to Netflix or some other streaming app, I found
          myself in my messaging app, clicking on Elio's message box and seeing
          my string of messages from when I was at the restaurant waiting for
          him, all read with no response. It was a little embarrassing.
          Rereading my texts, I realized how extremely needy I had sounded—not
          that I regretted it—but if someone had told me I'd be this needy and
          clingy over some guy, I would have snorted and called them crazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Elio wasn't just some guy...he was <i>Elio</i>. He held my heart
          on a platter; the feelings he provoked crept up on me and entrapped me
          in a warm blanket. A blanket that now carried a hotness filled with
          hurt, misunderstanding, and baggage, lots and lots of baggage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I clicked on the message box, and the keyboard popped up. Hesitating
          for a few seconds, I typed and sent:
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Are you awake?</b><br /><i>Read just now</i></p>
        <p>Read just--</p>
        <p>My eyes widened.</p>
        <p>He was...was he...Is he currently...</p>
        <p>
          A smile grew on my lips as I took the impulse of the action to send
          another text.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Weirdo</b><br /><i>Read just now</i></p>
        <p>
          It took a few seconds, but the bubbles appeared, my heart was thumping
          hard as it fell once more, and I pressed my teeth on my bottom lip as
          it appeared once more...and then:
        </p>
        <p><b>Bigbaby:</b><br /><b>Creep. </b></p>
        <p>
          My chest warmed, and I pressed the phone screen to myself, hugging the
          device as though it were him; after a moment, I brought the phone to
          my view and sent a response.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Asshole</b></p>
        <p>His reply took a little while, but it came.</p>
        <p><b>Bigbaby: </b><br /><b>Greedy thief.</b></p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Psycho killer</b></p>
        <p><b>Bigbaby:</b><br /><b>Witch. </b></p>
        <p>I giggled like an idiot.</p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Whore</b></p>
        <p><b>Bigbaby:</b><br /><b>Slut. </b></p>
        <p>
          As relieving as it was texting him this way, I knew we shouldn't be
          doing this...but damn it to hell, I missed talking to him, laughing
          with him. I hated space. I couldn't do space. But we needed
          space...right? Ugh, feelings were confusing.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me: </b><br /><b>We shouldn't be texting like this.</b></p>
        <p><b> </b><b>Me:</b><br /><b>We still have to talk. </b></p>
        <p>
          His response wasn't as immediate, but when it came, I was smiling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Bigbaby:</b><br /><b
            >Here I was, about to commend your articulate "butt dialing" skills.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>Chuckling, I sent a response.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Me:</b><br /><b
            >It wasn't "butt dial" this time. I couldn't sleep.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Y are you awake?</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>Bigbaby: </b><br /><b
            >I just showered from a late-night gym perspiration.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Me:</b><br /><b
            >Wow...so that's why you looked hotter...the gym, when did you quit
            self exercises?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p><b>Bigbaby: </b><br /><b>When you disappeared. </b></p>
        <p>
          I paused, blinking and reading the message. Not wanting to leave him
          on read for too long, I bottled the regret creeping up my spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Me:</b><br /><b
            >You looked good. The hair too...what's the story behind that? Why
            did you let it grow?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>His response was delayed two minutes before it came.</p>
        <p><b>Bigbaby: </b><br /><b>I cannot say. </b></p>
        <p>
          I don't know why I asked what I asked next—not when I looked like
          shit, but I had the strongest urge to see him. Texting him was helping
          distract my body from the desire to shoot off this bed and find
          alcohol by any means.
        </p>
        <p><b>Me:</b><br /><b>Can we Facetime?</b></p>
        <p>
          I held my breath, waiting for a response...minutes passed...minutes
          that made me think he'd never respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worry was beginning to creep in as I stared at the screen, manifesting
          with all my might that he said yes. I had mentioned earlier that we
          shouldn't be texting, but he had evaded that topic of conversation.
          That meant he wanted to talk to me, too, right? Maybe he just wanted
          to text? Perhaps he didn't want to see—
        </p>
        <p>
          A Facetime call from him had my phone vibrating. My heart lurched, and
          I quickly brushed my hand down my face as if that would magically
          repair all that was wrong with my appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swiped right, accepting the call as I pulled the covers up until it
          covered half of my face. When he appeared, I realized he wasn't in bed
          like me. He wasn't even looking at the camera; he was busy opening a
          carton of milk; there was a bowl of cereal right in front of him,
          telling me he had placed the phone somewhere directly to his front
          where he didn't have to hold the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was in a modern-looking kitchen, probably sitting on a stool. The
          lighting was also dim, but I could still make him out. He was wearing
          a simple black sweatshirt. It looked very comfortable, big on his
          already big body, his hair was wet, and he did say he had just
          finished showering.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that aside, my chest hammered with longing. He looked so good, so
          comfortable; what I would give to hug him right now. To have him hold
          me and kiss me. To have him by my side, to finally make things all
          right between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do people put sugar cubes in cereals?" he asked, and I had to blink
          out of my thoughts. I watched him hesitate before pouring the Milk,
          looking at the bowl like it held contents from the moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I um—" clearing my throat from how croaked my voice sounded, "I think
          it depends on the cereal. Or your tastes in particular."
        </p>
        <p>"Hm." He hummed, "Do you put sugar cubes in your cereal?"</p>
        <p>"Nope."</p>
        <p>
          Nodding, he proceeded to pour the milk. When he had gotten his desired
          amount, he dropped the box, mixing the contents in the bowl as he
          lifted his gaze for the first time, looking at me. His eyes took me in
          for a few seconds before he looked at the bowl again.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you sick?" he asked.</p>
        <p>I suppressed a smile. "No...it has been a very long day."</p>
        <p>"It has?" he asked in an inquiring tone.</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, Dog, Milk, and Upper are here...I finally told them about—me
          and how I grew up."
        </p>
        <p>His eyes were on me again, "How did that go?"</p>
        <p>
          I managed a small shrug, "It went, I guess...they didn't make a huge
          fuss or act like anything has changed with how they see me,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded slowly, and I watched him take a spoonful of cereal into his
          mouth, chewing softly and swallowing. "How do you feel about that?" he
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Honestly, I feel good about it. I'm glad they don't treat me any
          different."
        </p>
        <p>
          "As I predicted," he said, "You should have told them a long time ago;
          you might have been able to avoid the fallout you created with them,"
          he said as if this were normal, talking after everything that went
          down between us...as if we didn't have any issues...while I
          appreciated that, I was still curious.
        </p>
        <p>"Why are you talking to me?"</p>
        <p>
          He swallowed the other spoonful of cereal he had taken, a frown on his
          face. "What do you mean?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why don't you hate me?" I asked, "I said some fucked up stuff, and we
          still haven't talked about it properly, I'm just...I'm a little
          confused about why you still indulge me when you can just...not."
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes took me in for a while before focusing intently on his
          cereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short moment, he looked at me, "No matter how much I wish to
          ignore you, I cannot bring myself to. It's impossible because I miss
          you, and I'm desperate enough to take all you can give me even when
          I'm not supposed to want what you want to give me."
        </p>
        <p>I swallowed hard.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm incapable of saying no to you," he continued, "It is just the way
          it is, I suppose." 
        </p>
        <p>"It sounds inconvenient," I said softly.</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, "It isn't. Nothing that involves you is
          inconvenient to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart expanded as I watched him take another spoon of cereal, his
          face squeezing, "Fuck," he said with his mouth full, "Too soft," he
          was getting off the stool with the cereal bowl in his grip. Underneath
          the sweater were matching sweatpants. I smiled, watching him pour the
          contents from the bowl onto the sink, washing the mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes took in stuff from the table, frowning when I caught a packed
          set of paintbrushes beside where he had dropped the milk carton.
        </p>
        <p>"Are those paintbrushes?" I couldn't help but ask.</p>
        <p>He turned, drying his hands with a small towel. "Yes."</p>
        <p>"Are they yours?"</p>
        <p>
          He hesitated for a bit before nodding and coming to retake his
          position. "Yes."
        </p>
        <p>"You paint?"</p>
        <p>"Therapy practices. It is nothing serious,"</p>
        <p>"Can I see something you've painted?"</p>
        <p>Another hesitation. "They really are nothing to look at."</p>
        <p>"I still want to see..."</p>
        <p>
          With a sigh, he stretched his hand and grabbed the phone, the camera
          shifting this way and that, "I'll send you something,"
        </p>
        <p>
          His wet hair fell slightly to his face, and his grey eyes were
          brighter than they had been from far away as he navigated through his
          phone; shortly after, a slight vibration alerted me to a message he
          had sent.
        </p>
        <p>I clicked on the pop-up and—</p>
        <p>
          "Are you shitting me?" I asked quietly as my eyes took in the
          portrait.
        </p>
        <p>Was this a portrait of me?</p>
        <p>
          My eyes took in the image before my eyes, and oh my God...it
          <i>was</i> a portrait of me. I had never posed for any picture like
          this, but he had placed me in a scenario I had never existed in. I
          looked so at...peace.
        </p>
        <p>"Is this me?" I asked, just to be sure.</p>
        <p>"I suppose,"</p>
        <p>
          "Elio, this is..." I trailed off, unable to hide myself under the
          covers anymore, "This is beyond incredible,"
        </p>
        <p>"It is nothing—"</p>
        <p>"Shut the fuck up, you could be selling this for so much money."</p>
        <p>"Do not exaggerate."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not exaggerating anything. My God. The fucked up chihuahua
          painting doesn't even hold a candle to this; it couldn't even be
          compared."
        </p>
        <p>"Zahra—"</p>
        <p>"I am being very serious. Have you considered selling?"</p>
        <p>He shook his head, "It is not for sale,"</p>
        <p>"But—"</p>
        <p>"Not for sale. Never for sale."</p>
        <p>"But it's—"</p>
        <p>"You really are very greedy, aren't you?"</p>
        <p>
          "A thief is always a thief," I said, "By the way, where exactly is
          this painting located?" I might as well find time to nick it if he
          didn't want to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, and if I could tell from the lightness in his eyes
          and the slight tilt on his lips, I'd say he was fighting back a smile.
        </p>
        <p>"You have no shame, none at all." He said.</p>
        <p>"I don't know what you're talking about,"</p>
        <p>
          "Right," he ran his fingers through his hair, "You need to sleep; you
          look exhausted."
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not sleepy,"</p>
        <p>
          "You look like you're one second away from fainting," he pointed out,
          and I didn't bother to correct him or tell him my appearance was due
          to the addiction I was fighting. "I'll let you go now," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to protest but knew I would likely be pushing it. He was
          taking a lot to talk to me, and I didn't want to make him realize
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I nodded. "Okay, I will try not to call or text you until
          we...talk properly,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Acceptable." He said, eyes lingering on my form, before he spoke
          again, his voice soft, "Goodnight Zahra, take care."
        </p>
        <p>My smile was small as I said, "You too,"</p>
        <p>
          The call disconnected, and I was left staring at the blank screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Swallowing, I once again, hugged the phone to my chest, settling back
          in the covers with a smile on my face as I replayed our conversation,
          recalling every expression he made, every rise and fall of his voice
          until slowly, and surely, I slipped into a calm slumber—a slumber too
          calm that I felt reluctant to open my eyes when I felt a shadow breeze
          by me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My subconscious mind was actively slamming alarm bells in my head. I
          knew I had been asleep briefly; it was one of the best sleep I'd had
          in weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted, my phone long discarded as I straightened my body in a
          sleep-ridden state, shivering when a cold breeze blew in from my side
          and frowning when the side of my bed tilted to the side a bit.
        </p>
        <p>My bed...someone was—</p>
        <p>
          My eyes snapped open, and I caught the dark shadow above me.
          "Ahmmmfff," My scream was cut off by a solid cold hand covering my
          mouth. My body struggled underneath the weight of the stranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shhhh," he silenced hurriedly, but I wasn't having it; my hands flew
          around, supplying blows, my legs raising to land kicks. The stranger
          groaned, "Would you—" I kicked him in the groin, "Fuck!" he shouted in
          a pained whisper, but still didn't budge. What he did, though, was
          take off whatever dark mask he had worn, and his familiar face came
          into view, "It's me, it's me, Z. Be quiet; there's someone in your
          fucking bedroom."
        </p>
        <p>
          I froze, my struggle coming to a halt as my eyes widened, taking in
          the person above me.

        <p>Hey!</p>
        <p>
          I'm alive, thankfully. It's been a minute since I updated. My flu is
          all gone, but there's no denying that I need a small break. From
          working behind the scenes to make sure you have physical copies of
          this series, to simultaneously working on giving you guys chapters and
          other side projects, I need a minute to breathe, take it all in, and
          not let life pass by while I huddle in the little screen of my laptop.

        <p>_______<br /><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>DEVIL REMOVED </b>his hand from my mouth, taking my sudden
          stiffness and quietness for compliance. He placed a finger across his
          lips, a motion for me to remain silent, and then, in the blink of an
          eye, he was off me. The motion feather light
        </p>
        <p>
          In the room's darkness, I caught his shadow whoosh towards my bathroom
          area. There was silence around the space for a few seconds, my muscles
          curling on tight as the final bouts of sleep left me, giving way to
          rational thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone was in my bedroom, someone that wasn't him...could it be...Oh
          God, no. Quietly, I slipped off the bed, stopping a moment as a wave
          of nausea attacked me. I pursed my lips, keeping my tongue flattened
          in my mouth while I dragged in a long breath, my chest expanding as
          the nausea calmed a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tying my robe around me, I stood quietly. What had Devil been doing in
          my bedroom? How had he gotten in?
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaze moved to the opened window, catching the lights from the
          compound shining in, accompanied by the cool breeze that had me
          turning to my bedside table. It was almost 6 AM. It seemed I had slept
          a while since dropping Elio's call.
        </p>
        <p>
          Audible footsteps approached from the bathroom, and I rushed to turn
          on the light switch. The room was bathed with enough light when Devil
          walked out of the bathroom with a confused frown. "I could swear I saw
          someone jump through the window...but it's—the room is empty, aside
          from me and you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting my arms around myself, I watched him warily; he looked the
          same, shrouded in all black with a black mask resting below his face,
          his hair rough like he hadn't given care for it before he left
          wherever he was coming from.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How a—" My voice broke off, and I cleared my throat, "What are
          <i>you</i> doing in here? How did you get in?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The window," he answered, eyes finally taking me in. sweeping quickly
          from my head to toe, "I arrived about two hours ago; I was shown my
          room, but I had to step out shortly after for some...work, snuck back
          into the compound to avoid being tracked based on the...work I had to
          do. I was heading back into the building when I caught a figure on the
          small roof by your window. It was odd, and I didn't think it was
          normal for people to sneak into their rooms around here, so I checked
          it out. I didn't know it was your room until I saw you lying there.
          but now...I'm not sure what I saw," his frown returned. "There's no
          one here but me and you,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed. "This shadow you saw—can you make them out, like their
          height or what they were wearing? If it could be a woman or a man?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, "I caught sight of them for two or three seconds,
          and that was it. But if that was the case, someone is supposed to be
          here—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Someone was," I said, a chill crawling up my spine as I slowly began
          pacing, "Someone was here. I have a stalker; I've been—I've been
          seeing signs of them for a few days now, but I don't understand." I
          said, looking over at his concerned stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dull headache plagued me, and I squeezed my fists on my arm, trying
          to stop my fingers from shaking. "I had pictures taken of me without
          my consent, then I was drugged and transported from Milan to here,
          and...and this afternoon someone was in my dressing room, and they
          left me a note, and now you see a shadow entering my bedroom, and
          suddenly they're gone?"
        </p>
        <p>"What note?" Devil asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Something about dressing in...hold on, it's over there," I brushed
          past him to the antique drawer chest close to the dressing room door.
          I had kept the dress, shoes, and jewelry I wore the day before, just
          as the way the person had splayed it on the dressing room table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lifting the lamp from the chest, I grabbed the long golden key hidden
          under it and quickly opened the first drawer. The dress, the heels,
          and the jewelry were in place, but that white card was missing.
        </p>
        <p>I froze.</p>
        <p>
          "That's impossible," I whispered, frantically searching the drawer,
          throwing out the jewelry, gown, heels, everything. "It was here, I...I
          kept it here," I whirled around to regard Devil. "It was here. They
          left a note, and I—I kept it because I was going to show Vitale,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil's brow was laced in a frown, "So you think the person took it?"
        </p>
        <p>"Obviously!"</p>
        <p>
          He looked uncertain, "I don't know Zahra, I was pretty quick in
          following the shadow; I don't think they would have been quick enough
          to—"
        </p>
        <p>"But you said you saw someone,"</p>
        <p>
          "I could have been mistaken; it was quick. I have had a long day, and
          I've been chasing and assassinating shadows all night; I might have—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," I shook my head, "You <i>did</i> see someone; they came in here,
          they took the note because they knew I would want to show it to
          Vitale; they did this; whoever that person was, they did this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "They would also be here...if I really did see someone enter the
          room," he thought aloud, "If no one is here, then..."
        </p>
        <p>"I know what I'm saying,"</p>
        <p>He sighed, "Do you have any idea who this...stalker might be?"</p>
        <p>
          I remained quiet momentarily, running my hand tiredly down my face. "I
          have my suspicions, but the person at the center of them is...the
          person is supposed to be dead, so I'm not sure, maybe...maybe it's not
          them, maybe someone is fucking with me, pretending to be them,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil looked around the room, "Do you have CCTV cameras installed
          here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head, "There's none in the house. The previous owner
          refused to have them installed, and it's been that way for years," I
          rubbed between my eyebrows, "I should have had that changed, fuck."
        </p>
        <p>"This person you suspect...Is he Martino? The previous owner?"</p>
        <p>"It's foolish. He's dead. It shouldn't be."</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, it shouldn't." he responded, "And you're sure...of
          this...everything? The note? And you being drugged?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I...yes, it all happened, but I don't—I don't know...Devil. I have no
          way to prove all this. What if you had indeed seen that shadow? If
          someone had really been in here—" I said, holding myself tighter, "If
          that truly were the case, then we'd have found someone...God, I feel
          like I'm going crazy."
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment I said that, I felt another wave of nausea; this one was
          strong to the point that my feet were carrying me straight to the
          bathroom, my chest and throat felt tight, my stomach turned, and my
          knees buckled the moment I got in front of the toilet seat. I was
          falling, opening the lid, and throwing up the little food I had
          managed to get in yesterday. Food that, apparently, never digested.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't register Devil's footsteps until he was hurriedly crouching
          beside me, taking and holding my hair back as he rubbed my back,
          stiffening beside me for a second when his palm connected with me
          while I emptied my stomach, coughing and wincing at the strain on my
          ribs and stomach muscles.
        </p>
        <p>"Easy," he said soothingly.</p>
        <p>
          I heaved until nothing was left to give; my hands shook, and sweat
          beaded from my skin holes, making my skin hot and sticky.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt so fucking empty, drowsy, weak, hot. My insides felt so, so
          uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I allowed myself a chance to breathe before lifting slightly and
          flushing the vomit. Squirming off Devil's hold, I let my back rest on
          the ceramic build of the toilet, ignoring his confused stare as I dug
          the heel of my palm into my eyes. The shaking of my fingers was
          evident as I tried to push back the sting in my eyes. "I can't do
          this...not now," my voice shook. "I can't be weak now; there's so
          much—so fucking much I have to be strong for,"
        </p>
        <p>"What do you mean? You're not weak," he said kindly.</p>
        <p>
          "I am—I am, but I don't have time to get my shit together," I said, my
          throat sore, "I want to...I want to get my shit together, but I can't
          do it now...not with everything happening. Someone is messing with me,
          I know it...I fucking know it and this is not helping," my eyes were
          wet when I took my shaking hands from them. "I need to be strong, and
          if I can't do it the right way, then I'll...I'll do all I can to be
          strong for now, and—and find this person...if they're not in my
          head...which I'm sure they're not...I'm sure. I don't know," joining
          my hands together, I jammed it lightly to my forehead, "I don't know
          anything,"
        </p>
        <p>We were quiet before he spoke, "What is wrong with you?"</p>
        <p>
          I remained quiet, shame bathing me in all colors of red. I couldn't
          look at him, couldn't tell him how far gone I was, how different I was
          from the person he once knew. I couldn't let this secret leave the
          threshold of Vitale and me. My friends relied on my strength, and as
          much as it seemed dull now, my determination fueled theirs. I couldn't
          let them see this side of me, creating doubts that I wasn't strong
          enough to end the MCSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I folded my hands into fists as I shook my head, "Nothing...I'm
          just—this whole thing is a mess, and it's fucking with my head...I'm
          trying so hard not to panic." I met his gaze. "I also need alcohol," I
          said, hoping shame didn't reflect in my voice, "just something to help
          me get through this whole stalking mess, to help me think straight,
          get the edge off."
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, getting to his feet as he outstretched his hand to help me
          up, "We can go down—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's no alcohol in the house," I placed my hand on his, letting
          him pull me up, "Vitale's odd rules," I lied, standing on my two feet,
          letting go of his hand and hiding the dizziness that took over me as I
          stumbled to the sink to rinse my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have a bottle of whiskey in my bag; I brought it for the road,"
          Devil said, and Relief flooded my system as I dried my mouth, holding
          myself up on the sink, trying not to let any eagerness show because he
          was beginning to eye me warily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't hide my gratitude, "You're a lifesaver. And—God, it's
          really good to see you, all this aside, I—I missed you,"
        </p>
        <p>Sweat rolled down the side of my face.</p>
        <p>
          Devil nodded with a tight smile, still watching me. 'It's good to see
          you too, Z."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded with my heavy head, "I'll take a shower, and I'll be right
          down in the lounge area,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will be there with the drink," he started to turn but stopped to look
          at me again, "You sure you're good?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, definitely."</p>
        <p>
          He nodded, "We'll figure it out, Z; if someone really is stalking you,
          we will find them. Okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed another nod with a smile this time, watching him leave the
          bathroom and the room.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>When I reached the lounge area, I spotted Devil and Dog.</p>
        <p>
          Dog was behind the counter, work papers and a laptop in front of him,
          with a plate piled up with delicious-looking sandwiches, while Devil
          sat on a stool, two glasses on the table, each containing the whiskey
          still half-filled right next to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed my steps so it wouldn't seem hurried. I needed to think
          straight and feel strong, not weak. This was the only way. This was
          the only thing I could do to properly assess my situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or was it? Am I being purposefully delusional? Is this the addiction
          speaking?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dog raised his head when he spotted me, but he looked back at the
          laptop. It was small, but I noticed how his form tightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Morning," I greeted when I reached them, slipping by the counter to
          grab a whiskey glass. My fingers shook, and I almost dropped it, but
          thanks to quick reflexes, I managed that little mistake, raising my
          gaze to find the Devil's eyes on me. Studying and watching, waiting
          for a slip. "Pour me a drink?" I asked, slipping the glass towards
          him. I couldn't trust my fingers to lift the bottle, and I also needed
          to quench the awkward quietness as Dog concentrated on his work with a
          frown on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil made busy by pouring me a drink. The sharp tang of the alcohol
          in it had my head spinning, and I mentally stabbed myself multiple
          times for that craving.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks," I said when Devil dropped the bottle, pushing the glass
          towards where I stood a reasonable distance from Dog but still beside
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I picked up the glass and wasted no time gulping down the whiskey
          without consciousness. I didn't stop to savor, breathe, or taste; I
          just swallowed, knowing I needed the effect rather than the drink's
          flavor. It burned down my chest to my stomach, and I felt my muscles
          relaxing and easing. I drank until the last drop; my eyes closed as my
          body grew warm. It was not the warmth that brought the sweating; it
          was the kind of warmth that made me feel good. So, so good.
          Strong...calm, and normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feeling was a terrible illusion. A craving that called for more
          and more, but at the back of my mind, I knew I wasn't alone; I could
          feel eyes on me. I remembered instantly where I was and in whose
          company.
        </p>
        <p>Shit.</p>
        <p>
          Opening my eyes, I caught Devil's suspicious frown trained on me. I
          moved my gaze to Dog to see him staring with one of his brows raised
          as if to ask, 'What is happening right now,'
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, flickering my gaze between them as I awkwardly lifted my
          glass, "It's...good whiskey; it's been a while since I've had good
          whiskey,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Seems like so," Devil said as Dog looked away with a shake of his
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed, getting the courage to reach for the whiskey bottle, pour
          another drink, and sip normally this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought you took a vacation from work?" I directed the question at
          Dog as I shifted closer, looking at the papers and pictures of case
          files.
        </p>
        <p>"I did." He responded.</p>
        <p>"You're still working,"</p>
        <p>"I am," he said.</p>
        <p>"What are you working on?"</p>
        <p>
          He lifted his gaze from the laptop, looking in my direction and
          catching me staring at the files. "What the fuck are you doing?" he
          asked sharply, his frown turning into a glare, as he shoveled the
          papers away from me. "These are classified,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's sprawled for everyone to see," Devil said, taking a sandwich
          from the plate beside Dog, who sent a glare his way. "That looks
          gruesome; what was it? Hit and run?" he asked with his mouth full.
        </p>
        <p>
          I caught the picture Devil was staring at. A woman, all bloodied by
          the side of the road, pale and very, very dead. Telling from the
          picture, she had probably been dead a couple of days before they found
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The body was staged there," I said, and this time, Dog directed the
          glare at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled widely at me, and there was no denying how fake that very
          action was, and his following words were proof of that tiny
          observation, "That's awesome, Zahra; help me with a case you are not
          supposed to know about, and of course, feel free to give me your
          opinions I never asked for because I am a dimwit who can't figure it
          out <i>myself</i>."
        </p>
        <p>I blinked.</p>
        <p>
          Devil snorted, "You <i>are</i> a dimwit; I honestly wonder how you
          cope with your collogues. They must hate your gut,"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, because they want to be me,"</p>
        <p>
          "Of course. Everybody wants to be Reagan; it's so cool being in your
          shoes," Devil said with an eye roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good morning," Milk's voice came from the entrance, and I turned to
          see her stretching and massaging her neck muscles. She was in pink
          pajamas with fluffy pink bedroom flip-flops. Her eyes took us in, and
          she smiled at Devil, "When did you arrive?"
        </p>
        <p>"A couple of hours ago." He said, "Love the hair,"</p>
        <p>She beamed and grinned. "Thank you,"</p>
        <p>
          She had that 'woke up like this look.' Her hair was a lovely red, and
          the waviness of it held a perfection I could never get my hair to. I
          felt a slight twinge of longing to talk with her, ask her how she
          stayed radiant, how she could still look like she woke up in a bed of
          roses in this house, this house that held so many mental scars with
          just a glance at a small corner of a room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of all, I just wanted to talk, catch up, and ask her about her
          life and business. It was a longing that expanded to me wanting to
          know all about Dog too, what he had been up to, what life was like on
          the right side of the law, his friends, if he had any. The most
          ridiculous case he had ever worked on, if he ever dated, and what went
          down between him and Milk because I had noticed him stiffen with her
          appearance, and she had equally done what I expected, ignored him like
          he wasn't there.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How did you sleep?" I asked with a smile as she settled on a stool
          beside Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good...I guess. At first, I suspected the mansion was haunted; I did
          a little cleansing and went to sleep. It was a good sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cleansing..." I quirked my brow. "I think I might need some of that."
        </p>
        <p>
          She offered a small smile, and I wondered if now would be an excellent
          time to take her aside and talk to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I drank up all the whiskey in my glass, moving to take another round
          when I felt myself getting better than the shaky leaf I was before
          coming here.
        </p>
        <p>I picked up the whiskey bottle and began to—</p>
        <p>
          "Planning to get drunk, Faizan?" Dog said without looking at me. He
          was rapidly exchanging messages with someone on whatever secret
          platform the FBI used to communicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked towards Devil to see him questioning me with a look. "Was
          wondering the same thing."
        </p>
        <p>"Is there an occasion?" Milk asked.</p>
        <p>
          I looked around them, Dog finally tearing his eyes off his laptop to
          stare at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I—no...there's no occasion, I'm just...tired and need a head start
          for what looks to be a long day. it's normal...I drink all the time.
          Did you guys forget?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was beer," Dog said pointedly, "This is whiskey. You're drinking
          it like it's water,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "All alcohol tastes the same to me; like I said, it's good whiskey." I
          shrugged, ignoring their inquisitive stares.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I guess I need a head start, too," Milk broke the silence as
          she gestured for a glass, which I provided, pouring her a drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't remember any of you being early birds," Upper said, walking
          in with a water bottle, running shorts, and a tank top with boots. I
          already knew he was going for a run.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Morning," I said with a smile; just the same time, Milk waved, and
          Dog gestured his head in greeting before resuming his work. Devil
          leaned a hand on the counter; body angled towards Upper with a smile
          on his face.
        </p>
        <p>A <i>smile</i> on his face.</p>
        <p>
          Something sure was going on, and I was itching to find out when, why,
          and how it all happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Want a running buddy?" Devil asked. "Didn't sleep at all last night,
          and Z says today might be a long day,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Upper returned his smile with a sly tilt of his lips, walking
          backward. "If you can keep up. See you fuckers later," he said,
          turning and walking out of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devil hopped off the stool, "Guess I'm going for a run," he announced
          before following the same path as Upper and disappearing from view.
        </p>
        <p>"Yup, definitely fucking," Dog said.</p>
        <p>
          "Mind your business," Milk said, getting off the stool. She stole a
          sandwich from the plate beside the dog, took her whiskey glass, and
          then walked away, leaving me and the guy watching Milk disappear
          around the corner.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head and focused on his laptop.</p>
        <p>"Did you make the sandwich?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes. Aurora permitted me; did I need to get your permission?"</p>
        <p>
          "No," I shook my head, smiling, "It's just cool to see that despite
          the whole FBI thing, you still love cooking—"
        </p>
        <p>"Nope, we are not doing that," he straightened.</p>
        <p>I frowned, confused. "What?"</p>
        <p>"Talking and reminiscing shit like we're old buddies."</p>
        <p>
          My shoulders slumped, "We kind of are...if you—if you think about it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Scoffing, he shut his laptop with a soft smack, dark eyes holding a
          semblance of irritation. "That's the thing about all this bullshit,
          Faizan. We never were. I understand why you created STREET, but it
          doesn't erase the fact that we were pawns. A cover-up for you—"
        </p>
        <p>"That's not—"</p>
        <p>
          "I've been thinking, trying to understand why you would pull the shit
          you pulled. But then your explanation yesterday gave me my answer.
          STREET, me? We mean nothing to you; like you said, we were a means to
          an end. You leaving us to die in that next-level stranger things
          underground is enough proof of that, so let's not stand here and
          pretend like we know shit about each other, or we care about each
          other because we don't. We have one common goal, stop those
          motherfuckers from hurting more children, and go our separate ways so
          we never have to see each other's faces again. That's what this is."
        </p>
        <p>
          I swallowed hard, frozen in place when he gathered the papers, slipped
          his laptop under his arm, and carried his plate of sandwich, "Enjoy
          the rest of your good whiskey," he muttered, and then he walked around
          the counter and out the lounge area, and I was alone—and it was quiet.
          It was so quiet that no one would believe some of the best people in
          the world had been here with me just minutes ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sudden sadness enveloped me, and I dropped the whiskey glass. Losing
          the zeal to stay strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed as though everyone had moved on. Found a purpose. A life.
          Had new friends and relations I knew nothing about, and had
          experiences and conversations I wasn't a part of. It was like standing
          in a room of very familiar people, but somehow, there was a spotlight
          on them and a dark cloud around you.
        </p>
        <p>Left out.</p>
        <p>Displaced.</p>
        <p>Alone.</p>
        <p>I covered my face with my palm.</p>
        <p>
          Did I truly lose them? Have I truly gone and destroyed whatever
          chances I had to get back into their lives? Was this how it was going
          to be from now on? Me chasing and them uncomfortably running away
          because they had no place for me?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sighing, I rubbed my palm down my face, eyes taking in the empty bar
          and...and freezing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I squinted at the white card in the middle of a table by the far
          corner of the bar.
        </p>
        <p>"What the—"</p>
        <p>
          I rushed around the counter, waving my way across the bar, between
          tables and chairs, as I reached the particular table the card laid.
        </p>
        <p>
          My head spun as I picked up the card, very similar to the one that had
          been on my dressing table.
        </p>
        <p>I flipped it around and—</p>

              >When will you realize I am the only one who wouldn't leave you

        <p>Hey!</p>
        <p>
          Jesus, the dust in this space is almost alarming! How did that happen?
          Why did it happen? What happened?
        </p>
        <p>
          How are you guys doing, hope you won't hesitate with the comment
          section this time, the comments in the last chapter were amazing, but
          I need more, I need something to knock me off my laziness and get me
          back to the land of the living. (Updating this book is The Land of the
          Living btw)
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, I still had a wonderful break, spending time off writing
          and just being with my family.

        <p>Hope you, enjoy the update!</p>

        <p>
          <b>IT WASN'T </b>until noon, after the new note arrived that I
          realized the aim of my stalker.
        </p>
        <p>Distraction.</p>
        <p>
          Whoever this person was, they wanted to distract me. They knew me,
          knew what would unsettle me, knew who could get in my head with the
          mere thought of their presence, and then they went headfirst, using
          that person to penetrate my walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I wasn't stupid. Martino was dead. He had been dead for years now;
          there was no way he had survived and somehow managed to stay in hiding
          all this time. That wasn't his move. Martino was more of the attack
          now, regret later kind of man. He didn't lie in wait if it wasn't
          completely necessary. There were many times I had been vulnerable,
          many times he could have started this whole shit show...
        </p>
        <p>
          Why wait now? Now that I have all the help I need, now that I'm
          working fervently to bring down the MCSS once and for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          It begged the question of who this person was...and what in hell they
          had to do with the MCSS to the extent that they would pretend to be a
          dead person just to distract me and mess with my head. If I wasn't
          entirely out of it, they probably wanted to make my friends think I
          was crazy, too.
        </p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>
          Was this someone from the society? Someone from the Marino empire? Or
          someone entirely out of the sphere my alcohol-muddled brain couldn't
          comprehend at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rinsed my mouth, dropped my toothbrush, and breathed into my
          enclosed palm to smell my breath. It was clear from every stench of
          Devil's whiskey and of every proof that I had taken in alcohol today.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spotted a lunch tray on my bed when I walked out of the bathroom;
          Aurora must have decided to bring it up since I hadn't left my room.
          She always assumed I wanted it up here when I didn't come down.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sigh, I plopped down on the bed and slipped my hand underneath
          the pillow to pull out the note from the lounge area, rereading its
          content.
        </p>
        <p>My jaw tightened.</p>
        <p>I'd made a decision not to show anyone.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to deal with this motherfucker myself because I didn't trust
          whoever they were, neither was I aware of what they were capable of.
          Or the lengths they would go to get what they wanted from me. I
          couldn't put the people I cared about in their path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitale was a pain in the ass sometimes, but I liked him alive, and
          Devil was one of my best friends and the only blood relative the man I
          love had; we still haven't settled our differences, and I didn't want
          to add putting his brother in trouble as one of the things I needed to
          apologize for—so this stalker bullshit will be <i>my problem</i> to
          solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          As foolish as it might sound, it was for the best. If I were dealing
          with someone intimately familiar with Martino, I'd have to protect my
          friends until I understood what was happening, and if it got out of
          hand, I could always rope Vitale in.
        </p>
        <p>But for now...</p>
        <p>
          I stared at the plate of food in front of me. It looked like some
          familiar Italian dish made with boiled sweet
        </p>
        <p>
          potatoes and seafood garnishing. It smelled amazing, too, and I
          managed to take in five spoonfuls before I suddenly became tired. It
          felt like my stomach was already sleeping, unable to collect more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped, swore under my breath, and went to dispose the rest of it,
          asking for wine to be brought up; at least I could keep that down with
          the bit of food I had eaten.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stayed up for a few hours afterward and decided to swallow my
          hesitance when I finally stepped out of my room towards the direction
          of the visitor's bedroom quarters, stopping right in front of Milk's
          door.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was muffled, but I could hear voices, one distinct, the other,
          which was clearly her own, louder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to talk to her, clear the air as best as I could, and apologize
          for all the shit I said; maybe it would make the atmosphere around us
          more tolerable, make her smiles less forced or tight with discomfort—I
          really messed things up between us with what I said, and I doubted a
          simple apology would help much, but I had to try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knocking softly, I dragged a breath through my teeth as nervousness
          clamped up my throat, looking down the long, dark hallway where Dog
          and Upper's door stood facing each other. Devil's door remained at the
          far end of the hallway.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knocked again, boldly this time, but not too boldly. My hesitation
          was like fire in every movement I made, raging and hot. I was bad at
          this, bad at apologizing, at saying goodbye, and at letting people in.
          Those three things were core aspects of any human's life, and I didn't
          excel in them. I never once tried to, but then again, I didn't lead an
          everyday life, and no one practices this stuff. It's just something
          everyone should know.
        </p>
        <p>
          All I knew was regret; my being knew how to work and wield that
          feeling because it always came with a solid need to rectify the things
          I felt regretful about, even if it meant letting my pride slip up a
          little—but this was different, this wasn't just about my regret,
          though it was a huge part of it, but it was also a mistake, a very
          terrible mistake that had me losing the trust and affection of someone
          very close to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though it was long ago, I wouldn't forget the apprehension that had
          been in Milk's voice the day I called her. She sounded irritated,
          uncomfortable, and maybe a little scared, like my voice was a needle
          struck against the perfect bubble that was the new life she had gotten
          for herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd never heard Milk use that tone on anyone. It had me almost
          refraining from calling the others because if Milk could respond that
          way, I wondered if the others might be even worse—but that was all in
          the past. Now, I had to fix things...as best as I could.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knocked again, and the voices from inside stopped with Milk's voice
          yelling a small, 'Coming!' It was followed by soft footsteps quickly
          approaching the door, and then the oak wooden frame was pulled open,
          and her eyes widened a little when she saw it was me.
        </p>
        <p>"Hi," I said with a smile.</p>
        <p>"H-hey," she stuttered, a furrow dropping her brows.</p>
        <p>
          "Can I—" I gestured to the bedroom, and she looked confused for the
          first few seconds before she opened the door wider, stepping aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her laptop was on her bed, a bowl of ice cream by the side, and
          several nail polishes on the other side of the bed.
        </p>
        <p>"I hope I'm not interrupting anything?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh...no," she said, closing the door and walking over to her bed,
          tucking her hair behind her ear as she settled on the bed, "Just give
          me a sec," she said, clicking a button on her laptop as a bright,
          comfortable smile appeared on her face, "Hey guys, I gotta go now,
          I'll continue the movie from here, and text my reactions as I watch."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Aww, It's tradition, Pen!" A voice said from the laptop, unfamiliar.
          One of her new friends, probably.
        </p>
        <p>I shifted uncomfortably.</p>
        <p>
          "I know," she said, almost like she would give anything to have me out
          of the room, "But um..." she raised her gaze to me and then back to
          the screen, "I really gotta go, it's uh...family stuff."
        </p>
        <p><i>Family...</i></p>
        <p>
          I suppressed the urge to smile as I shifted, watching her say goodbye
          to her friends, close her laptop, and settle fully on the bed, ice
          cream bowl in hand, as she looked at me, "Ice cream?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I made my way to the bed, sitting at the end as I shook my head, "No,
          thanks,"
        </p>
        <p>"It's vanilla, you like vanilla,"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah..." I couldn't remember the last time I had anything Vanilla, "I
          do, but...I'm still very full with lunch, so..."
        </p>
        <p>"Of course," she said, dropping it to the side and looking at me.</p>
        <p>
          Clearing my throat, I clasped my hands together. "I wanted to come up
          and...and talk to you...about, before? The—everything that happened in
          that hospital room, the things I said to you..."
        </p>
        <p>She didn't speak, but I knew she was listening.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry, Milk—I-I mean, Penelope—"</p>
        <p>"Call me whatever, it's fine," she said.</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, "Okay," I said, readjusting my position on the bed, "Those
          things I said...while I meant some of them to an extent...I shouldn't
          have commented on your...on your body, it was wrong, and low, and
          shameful on my part, and I shouldn't have made a comment on your mom,
          and used something you told me in confidence against you...it was
          fucked up. So fucked up, and I'm so sorry."
        </p>
        <p>She swallowed, looking away from me for the first time.</p>
        <p>
          "I know it's not something you can forgive, which is okay. I broke
          every trust we shared and ruined our relationship in the worst way
          possible. I just wanted to let you know that no day has passed without
          me regretting what I did...all I said to you." I said, and she raised
          her gaze to me and sighed. 
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah," she said quietly, "Thanks for...for telling me all that."</p>
        <p>I nodded.</p>
        <p>
          An awkward silence passed, and I realized it might be my cue to leave.
          I had nothing more to say, though I would have loved to talk more, but
          maybe she needed the space to let it all sink in.
        </p>
        <p>I looked away from her, attempting to stand.</p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry," she spoke up, and I stopped my movement, settling back on
          the bed and returning my gaze to her, "I'm sorry if I'm—if I'm a
          little stiff," she said, "I just—I just need some time to...to settle
          with it all...you were right when you said I wanted my own thing
          outside of STREET, I did. I wanted a real business, more
          relationships...though I never thought I would have had to leave
          STREET to find those things,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You didn't have to...none of us had to do anything on our own. I was
          foolish and didn't think before making my decisions. We could have
          still been a team and a family while we moved forward to achieve our
          own. I know that,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah. Yeah, you're right," she said, "But I feel like this was meant
          to happen; we each needed to find ourselves without anyone pulling us
          back." She said, hesitating, looking down at her fingers before
          speaking, "I've spent the past year trying to evaluate...I even
          started seeing a therapist online because I thought I had issues with
          always putting my body forward before my brain,"
        </p>
        <p>My heart squeezed. "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it that way—"</p>
        <p>
          "But it's the truth," she said, a resignation in her eyes. "My mom had
          us surviving on the money she made from private hookups with rich men,
          some younger than she was...and most times they would come to the
          house and try to talk to me; they'd say I was prettier than she was,
          and she would get mad...it was always about beauty to her." she smiled
          sadly, "You'd see her fuss over the smallest wrinkle on her face or a
          small loose in her blouse...though your words hurt, it made me realize
          that I might need a little help myself."
        </p>
        <p>I didn't know what to say, so I kept quiet.</p>
        <p>
          She sighed loudly, but there was a smile on her face, and it wasn't as
          tight as it had been. "But really, Zahra, thanks for...for talking to
          me and making an effort."
        </p>
        <p>I smiled back. "Of course,"</p>
        <p>
          She nodded, getting more comfortable on the bed as she eyed me with
          curiosity, "So..." she drawled, "you're engaged, that's...that's new,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved my head this way and that, "Not really, I've sort of always
          known I would be engaged to Vitale for years...before street.
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded in understanding, "Oh...but there is something, right? I
          mean, the way he looks at you and the dynamic the both of you have,
          you seem very familiar with him,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's because we're friends; I met him when I first moved into this
          estate, and we trained and worked together to achieve all we have now.
          Our engagement won't last; it was done to help him achieve something
          he needed, and we're almost at the finish line."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And Elio?" she asked carefully, "I mean, I don't really know how it
          ended with you both. I uh...I heard about the shooting when you were
          in a coma?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, that." I blinked, "Feels like a long time ago..." I trailed
          off, "Elio and I, it's complicated, a complication I hope we'll solve
          when he comes to Sicily,"
        </p>
        <p>She nodded.</p>
        <p>"What about you?"</p>
        <p>She frowned, "Me?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know anything about you...other than that you started your
          own company, which is amazing, by the way."
        </p>
        <p>
          She grinned, "Thank you, it feels amazing, finally got that dream,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," I swallowed, "I'm sorry I have you taking a break from it,"
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, "Don't apologize, it's for a good cause, that's
          all that matters."
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started nodding, she brought the already melting ice cream
          between us again, "Another go at vanilla? A little crossing the water
          under the bridge treaty,"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at the bowl, completely unwilling to eat, but I smiled and
          accepted her offer nonetheless, taking a small scoop of the ice cream
          into my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmmm, it's good...so good," I nodded, forcing myself to swallow,
          "Well, I should—"
        </p>
        <p>"Do you wanna meet my friends?" she asked, and my eyes widened.</p>
        <p>
          "Uh..." I blanked, shocked at the question. I didn't think she'd ask
          me that...maybe she was being polite? "Do you think that's a good
          idea?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why not? They know about you...but they think you're dead." she
          blinked, and I nodded slowly.
        </p>
        <p>"How are you gonna wing that?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know? My family's weird? People come back from the dead cause
          we're literally living in what looks like—some mystery mansion or
          something. They were shocked when I gave them a virtual tour; I'm
          allowed to do that, right?"
        </p>
        <p>"Sure, as long as you didn't share the location."</p>
        <p>"Of course. It's secret, I know." She smiled, "So, you ready?"</p>
        <p>
          I wasn't ready; I didn't want to see or speak to anyone, didn't have
          the energy or the zeal to meet new people, people who wouldn't
          understand half the shit I was going through because their lives were
          so...<i>normal,</i> and they might spot I wasn't like them with just
          one look at me. I could only do friendship with girls when it came to
          Milk, but any other girl...I wasn't too sure about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would love to," I smiled apologetically, "but maybe some other
          time? I have some work I have to finish, and next time, I might do a
          little dress up so I don't scare anyone off,"
        </p>
        <p>She nodded, eyes scanning me from head to toe, "You look...okay?"</p>
        <p>
          "Since when did you start lying about my looks? You were always
          honest. I know I look like shit."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, you look like you've been dragged through the mud and out, and
          your hair is a mess and needs good treatment; you probably need a
          little tan because, honey, you look too pale to be alive; your nails
          are also chipped and shaped weirdly, and I feel like you haven't
          cleaned an eyeliner makeup you applied badly a week ago, your lips
          could also use a bit of hydration, they look so dry, you need to care
          for them, and your eyelashes look like they're falling out, I don't
          think you've been using the right mascara, your wardrobe sense seems
          to be the only thing that has improved since I last saw you. Other
          than those things, I think you look amazing,"
        </p>
        <p>I rolled my eyes, "Yeah, of course, amazing."</p>
        <p>"Nothing a few days attention won't correct,"</p>
        <p>
          I smiled, "Got it, but I'll let you finish your movie for now," I got
          to my feet, "I'm glad we had this talk, Milk."
        </p>
        <p>She returned the smile, "Me too, Zahra."</p>
        <p>
          When I left the room, I left a little lighter than I had been when I
          first stepped in. We might not be all the way to being besties again,
          but we were getting somewhere, and honestly, I appreciated it either
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I had to talk to Devil and Dog. We needed a cordial environment
          to work, and I'd try to make it possible, even though it meant facing
          Dog and listening to him pushing reality back into my face.
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>
          I found Aurora stepping out of my bedroom when I reached my hallway,
          which wouldn't have been odd if I had sent for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she spotted me, she smiled, "I just dropped tea in there; I'm
          about to head home."
        </p>
        <p>"I didn't send for tea, Aurora,"</p>
        <p>
          "I know," she said softly, "But since you probably didn't eat much of
          lunch, you should have that at least."
        </p>
        <p>
          Frowning, I regarded her with confusion, "How do you know I didn't
          have much of lunch?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your plate was returned almost immediately it came up, and you sent
          for wine." She said with a knowing look, "I don't want to know what
          you do with the portion you don't eat because in my family, we never
          waste food, and I refuse to accept that you are up here wasting food,
          so let's not go into it. Just have your tea, and dinner will be
          microwaved and served when it's evening."
        </p>
        <p>I sighed, "You won't tell Vitale, will you?"</p>
        <p>"I am obligated to," she said with utmost determination.</p>
        <p>
          "Can you not tell him? I promise I'm trying. I just lose appetite the
          moment I see food, I don't—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should see a specialist about it, Zahra. You can't keep skipping
          food like it isn't essential for you to have food."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, I will ask Siro to make an appointment, but for now, can
          you—can you keep this between me and you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She supplied me a stern look for a few seconds before relaxing and
          nodding, "Fine, but if I don't see changes—"
        </p>
        <p>"You can go ahead and do the needful,"</p>
        <p>
          She gave me a firm nod, "I'll leave now; make sure you finish the tea.
          It's very important for your vitamins; it's herbal from my hometown."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, appreciating that she never failed to look out for me.
          "Thank you, Aurora."
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, bidding me goodbye as she went out of view. I escaped into
          my bedroom and saw the tea on the side table.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thought I had was to do with it what I had done with the
          food, but that would be unfair. She had taken her time to fix up
          something for me, knowing I hadn't eaten the lunch she made. The least
          I could do was chug it down and manage to keep it down after.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I picked up the teacup, my phone lit up with a notification to
          show it was fully charged. I was about to look away when I saw the
          notifications on my phone.
        </p>
        <p>A missed call from Elio.</p>
        <p>Shit.</p>
        <p>
          I dropped the tea cup eagerly and picked up the phone to see that he
          had followed it up with a text message.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Bigbaby:</b><br /><b>Arrived in Sicily.</b><br /><i
            >38 minutes ago.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>That's...earlier than expected.</p>
        <p>I smiled.</p>
        <p>
          Was he as eager as I was to clear the air? To have us talk this whole
          shit out? Kiss, make up, and be together? Because I was down for that.
          I was more than down for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I put a call through to him, jittery as I got to my feet again,
          pacing. The phone pressed to my ear, ringing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would run out of this compound in seconds if he wanted to meet now.
        </p>
        <p>Would he want to meet?</p>
        <p>
          Fuck...I looked like shit. Milk was probably right about the eyeliner
          thing, but would he mind? He's seen me look like shit many times
          before; he wouldn't mind, would he?
        </p>
        <p>No, he wouldn't.</p>
        <p>
          He wouldn't...but it didn't mean I wouldn't at least try to look okay.
        </p>
        <p>I was sober enough, thank God.</p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't freak him out holding my stomach, howling in pain, and
          puking all over the table—that is, if he wanted to meet at a
          restaurant or where he was staying. Where would he be staying? And how
          the hell did he enter Sicily without it reaching me before he could
          inform me?
        </p>
        <p>Was Vitale already aware? Was—</p>
        <p>He picked up the call, and my heart jumped...jumped and sped.</p>
        <p><i>"Oh God, it answered." </i></p>
        <p>
          My heart stopped altogether, halting with a loud grounding screech.
        </p>
        <p>That wasn't his voice.</p>
        <p>I brought the phone to my view, making sure it was his contact.</p>
        <p>It was.</p>
        <p>
          But the person who answered...was a woman...a woman with a clear
          English accent.
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart began racing, but this time for all the wrong reasons. It
          wasn't racing with anticipation or eagerness but with fear,
          apprehension, and worry.
        </p>
        <p>Why in hell's name was a woman answering Elio's phone?</p>

          Do you think Zahra's decision to keep everything to herself was a good

      <h1>15. Zahra/IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hey all, Please note: There is an important announcement at the end of
          this chapter. Please make sure you read it before you leave. Thank
          you, love you.
        </p>
        <p>_______<br /><b>ZAHRA</b><br /><b>_______</b><br /></p>
        <p>
          <b>EVERY WEAK</b> and desperate bone in my body hardened almost
          immediately. My excitement died, and anger simmered in its place; I
          balled my free hand into a tight fist as she spoke again, still not
          addressing me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"I'm sorry," </i>Her voice was smaller this time, and footsteps
          surfacing from the end of the line,
          <i
            >"I was juggling everything and trying to get the phone to you and—"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"It's all right, Ali. I already have people helping with our
            luggage, prepare for the auction; I will be with you shortly,"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Light footsteps faded, and a door slamming shut was heard before a
          small clearing of the throat and, <i>"Hello, Zahra," </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was unnerved, ridiculously annoyed, and curious—so,
          <i>so</i> curious to know who that was and why he spoke to her with
          such familiarity. She was no room service, and he had referred to her
          by her name, 'Ally,' and she was involved in their luggage. He said
          'our' luggage. They would be going off to some auction later. Whoever
          this 'Ally' was, he traveled with her—arrived with her. They were
          staying in the same vicinity, and if the luggage was being brought in,
          it meant they weren't staying together for a day but for the duration
          of his stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was she an escort? Elio didn't do escorts; Elio rarely ever attended
          these events himself unless it was completely necessary. Elio wouldn't
          leave his cell phone in someone else's hands unless there was complete
          trust between him and the person, or he probably forgot it on a table
          somewhere, and she had indeed—whoever she was—tried to get the phone
          to him.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Zahra."</i> His voice pulled me out of my head.</p>
        <p>
          I clenched my jaw, digging my nails into my palm as anxiety and
          curiosity battled to take control over what I said next.
          <i
            >Who was that? Why does she have your phone? What business do you
            have with her? Why do you speak to her with such familiarity? Are
            you fucking someone else while I'm here longing for you and being
            wholly unashamed and horrifyingly pathetic about it? Did you move
            on? You better not have touched a single hair on that woman's head,
            or I swear to God, Marino, I will hunt you down and—and—</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "I missed your call...I thought you were supposed to be here next
          week?" I said instead, biting down on my impulsiveness, anger, and
          thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a light shuffle, and I could tell he had taken his seat
          somewhere, <i>"I have business to attend." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Business?" I frowned, pausing. "What kind of business do you have in
          my city?"
        </p>
        <p><i>"None that professionally concerns you," </i></p>
        <p>"What the hell does that mean?"</p>
        <p>
          He sighed,
          <i
            >"You have no entitlement to something I don't think you need to
            know, Zahra."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          But she knows, this 'Ally' person knows the business he had here in
          Sicily, she was accompanying him to it, and he won't tell me. He won't
          try to explain why someone was answering his phone.
        </p>
        <p>He probably didn't think it was important information to divulge.</p>
        <p>
          My anger flared as irritation joined it, stayed, and mingled enough to
          fuck with my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If this business you have is being conducted in my city, and it was
          so important that it had you leaving your precious new home earlier
          than expected, then it is my concern; I won't have you fucking things
          up for—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Is this how you repay kindness, Miss Faizan?"</i> his voice was
          low, a little annoyed, just like mine had gotten.<i>
            "I allow you into my city, free of charge, to take whomever you want
            and question them, but I can't step into your city for some measly
            business without you verbally ambushing me for it?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I shifted, pinning my gaze on the tea by the bedside table. "A verbal
          ambush I have every right to because I asked for your permission
          before stepping into your city and even told you <i>why</i> I was
          stepping in, but now you tell me you have business aside from coming
          to see me or for the event that's happening next week, and I ask what
          this business is, and you tell me it's none of my concern?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Another sigh from him, the sound of a lighter flicking on, and then a
          tiny whoosh that indicated the lighting of a cigar.
          <i
            >"If you are so powerful that I need to shudder and whimper at the
            thought of entering Sicily without express permission from Her
            Majesty, I wouldn't even be in Sicily because your 'subjects' would
            have stopped it from happening before it happened."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>I gritted, the mocking tone in his voice inflating my anger.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Is your security weak, Miss Faizan? Or are you truly not as in
            charge as you believe? Is that man you're engaged to running the
            show using your name? Are you the placeholder for his power? The
            perfect picture to his image, the tiny little flower he gets to
            parade around while he lives your life for you?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"You don't know what you're talking about,"</p>
        <p><i>"Don't I?" </i></p>
        <p>
          A muscle in my eye twitched, and I was dashing towards the intercom in
          my room, quickly muting the call and speaking into the small device.
          "Send someone to my room immediately," I said, unmuting the call. "Why
          the fuck are you speaking to me this way?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"And why won't you just ask the question that is really on your
            mind, querida?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the intensity of our conversation, I felt flutters in my
          stomach from that nickname.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the silence, I could tell he was blowing out the smoke before he
          spoke again,
          <i
            >"You don't have to project your annoyance into a conversation that
            could go without us fighting just because you're stopping yourself
            from airing your thoughts aloud, which previously wasn't a problem
            you had."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          A hollow formed in my chest, causing spontaneous jolts and squeezes in
          my heart. I was scared to ask. I didn't want to upset him further by
          assuming things, but damn it to hell if I didn't want to know.
        </p>
        <p>"Who was that, and why did she answer your phone?"</p>
        <p>
          He let a few beats pass, maybe to toy with me or ask himself why he
          was dealing with me when he could hang up and let me stew with my
          assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"She's someone I know, and she answered by accident; she was
            rushing to hand me the device when she saw you calling."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Someone you know." I stated with disdain, "That's what you say when
          you don't want to divulge the identity of a person you're in contact
          with,"
        </p>
        <p><i>"You do know me. I should give you more credit." </i></p>
        <p>"Why won't you tell me who she is?" I pressed.</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Because I simply don't want to. You are going to have to trust
            me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I started pacing, tremors attacking my fingers. "Did you get a female
          assistant of some kind?"
        </p>
        <p><i>"No,"</i></p>
        <p>"Is she a friend of Casmiro's, Angelo's,"</p>
        <p><i>"No,"</i></p>
        <p>
          I ignored the disappointment in his voice. "Is she an escort to this
          auction you're attending?"
        </p>
        <p><i>"No, she is not." </i></p>
        <p>"Are you fucking her?"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"What sort of a question is that?" </i> I should pause with the
          anger now lacing his voice, but I have to know.
        </p>
        <p>"A question you're not answering. Are you fucking her?"</p>
        <p>
          He scoffed,
          <i
            >"Coming from someone who is always handsy with her fiancée, I
            should be asking you that question. Does your public display of
            affection extend into the bedroom, Zahra? The way you open your arms
            for him in public, is that the same way you open your legs in
            private?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd forgotten how cruel he could be if he wanted to, my chest caved
          in, and my voice trembled as I spoke, "Fuck off,"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Don't act like you're the victim; you asked me the ridiculous
            question first: does it feel good, doubting my loyalty just because
            I didn't answer my phone?"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're not in a relationship, so there's no fucking loyalty to be
          doubted, and that's the very reason I—"
        </p>
        <p><i>"There we go," </i></p>
        <p>"Can't be sure you're not with her like that."</p>
        <p>
          Silence stayed after I finished that statement, and I mentally
          replayed the conversation, trying to find where I went wrong.<i
            >"I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea," </i
          >I didn't like the resignation in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elio—" A knock came from the other side of my door. I ignored it.
          "Let's just meet now and talk—"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"So we could exchange words? Yell at each other till I get provoked
            and say things I do not mean and then beat myself up for speaking to
            you in a way I would hurt people for? This isn't healthy, Zahra."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Worry and apprehension gripped me, and I retraced my whole step.
          "Okay, okay...It's my fault. I'm sorry, I—I heard her voice, and I got
          scared because we aren't together and you're with her, and you didn't
          want to tell me what business you had with her; and it's not like you
          to be with some other woman because that's not you, and if you
          <i>are</i> with another woman, then it's something serious. I was—I
          was worried and angry at our situation, and I didn't know what to
          think so I—fuck, I'm sorry, let's meet, and talk it out."
        </p>
        <p><i>"No,"</i></p>
        <p>"Elio, come on."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"No, if this whole conversation has taught me anything, it's that
            nothing good would come off us talking now or at the event."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Something held my stomach in a tight clench as my eyes stung, wishing
          I could rewind the whole mess of a conversation. "What does that mean,
          Elio? Where does that leave us?"
        </p>
        <p>
          It was silent from his end until he broke it, <i>"I don't know." </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you mean you don't know," I said quietly, wanting to push
          more but unsure what to say or where to start apologizing. I was
          confused; how had I let the whole thing go this far?
        </p>
        <p><i>"I should go," </i></p>
        <p>"Wait—"</p>
        <p>
          <i>"We'll talk later." </i> He said, and the line disconnected. My
          shoulders slumped, my fingers still trembling, just as the knock came
          in again, and I remembered I had sent for someone.
        </p>
        <p>I blinked rapidly to remove the tears from my eyes, "Come on in,"</p>
        <p>
          The door pushed open, and a guard dutifully stepped in. "Yes, Miss
          Faizan,"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mr. Marino entered Sicily about an hour ago; inform the data team if
          they aren't already aware and have security details trailing his every
          move. I want to know everything: where he sleeps, what he does, who he
          talks to, and if necessary, down to what he eats and where; I need no
          detail to be left out. Report back when everything is in place."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, ma'am," he turned to leave, and my gaze fell on the cold cup of
          tea beside my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait," I called, and he stopped, turning to look at me without
          removing my eyes from the cup of tea. "Have someone follow Aurora
          home...discreetly. I have been receiving some unpleasant attention,
          and I need to make sure the people closest to me are safe. I don't
          want her knowing I have someone protecting her," I looked at the
          guard, "I'd hate if she panicked,"
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, Ma'am,"</p>
        <p>
          I nodded, "Make sure the detail assigned to her report back to me
          directly."
        </p>
        <p>"Will do, ma'am,"</p>
        <p>
          "Good, now leave; make sure it's known to everyone that I am not to be
          disturbed for the next few hours,"
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded once before turning and exiting the room, closing the door
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked down at the blank screen of my phone, itching to call Elio
          back, but I refrained. I'd call him in the later hours of today when
          he'd have calmed down from the argument and he wasn't thinking of
          cutting all ties with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I wanted to pursue the first lead I had of my Stalker. I was
          done playing the fucking hide and seek game they're obsessed with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to my drawer by the side, pulled it open, and picked up the
          cheap sachet of sleeping pills. I popped one into my palm and threw it
          into my mouth as I walked to my bedside table, grabbed Aurora's herbal
          tea, and swallowed the pill down with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One pill wouldn't knock me out, but it would have me relaxed, almost
          asleep, enough to see my visitor while they play around in my room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I laid on my bed, above the covers, eyes on the canopy material above
          me as I waited, waiting to feel my bones softening or my eyes drowsy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nothing happened. My thoughts were heading towards Elio's
          direction, replaying our conversation while I tried to block it out,
          to block out the hurt at him sounding so unsure of what was next with
          us. I needed a way to rectify this.
        </p>
        <p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and let it back out.</p>

          It took only a few minutes for my eyelids to grow heavy and hard to
          pull open. Few minutes for me to realize that I might not be
          self-aware if my stalker happened to pay a visit. Few minutes before I
          lost all sense of consciousness to the vulnerability of the quietness
          in my room.

            the dining table was tipping oddly to the side, and the room came in
            and out of focus as I blinked, lights flickering here and there

            and whistling that familiar tone.

            back, making me more disoriented as one of his hands squeezed my
            breast. "Touching you like this...on a table where I watched you eat

            plunging it right into his left eye.

            this series. Before I began this book I informed everyone that there
            is a huge possibility that I would remove this series from Wattpad
            when it's time. And that time has finally arrived.</b

            encouraged when I saw a majority of you wanting to have physical
            copies of these books! I want to see you all hold a copy of this
            book and the series in your hands someday, and I'm doing everything
            in my power to make that possible. </b
          ><br /><b> </b><br /><b
            >In order to pursue this dream, I am taking this story down from
            wattpad on the 14th of April. I know a lot of you will be
            disappointed by this, but I want to urge you to continue to support
            me. And though it won't be on Wattpad, I have plans to make the
            series complete and available in the near future.</b
